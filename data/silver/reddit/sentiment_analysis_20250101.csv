Even in open systems, code often remains centralized. A small group of developers ends up steering direction, while millions of users have little to no real input.

As Song puts it: When developers value different things than users, something has to give. Either you get new developers aligned with users, or users leave.

This is less a technical issue and more a coordination one.
How do you align large, global communities when human consensus doesn’t scale?

Many projects have tried to solve this through voting based governance, but that approach has serious flaws:

1. Code proposals are too complex for most users to evaluate.

2. Voting doesn’t scale, who decides what gets voted on?

3.Hierarchies and political dynamics inevitably form.

4. Expression gets reduced to binary “yes/no” inputs that miss nuance.

In short, even decentralized systems can fall into centralized coordination traps.

Recently, some new approaches have started emerging. One of them from Tau Net, led by Ohad Asor takes a very different route. Instead of relying on voting, it uses a logical AI system that interprets what users mean (in computable language), maps out areas of agreement and conflict and then derives consensus automatically.

Whether or not this specific model succeeds, it raises an important question. 
Can we build governance mechanisms that reflect what communities actually think and want without depending on hierarchy, politics, or mass voting?

As you can see in the image above, the latest data from a16z, it shows something really interesting, 42% of the founders are building right now or planning to build on Ethereum and Base. That is more than every other chain combined.

* Ethereum - 22%
* Base - 20%
* Solana - 16%
* Bitcoin - 8%

This is not just a stat, it is a clear signal of where the next wave of innovation is heading. Ethereum still plays for the long tame and they are trusting its foundation. The liquidity, the tooling and the dev culture are still unmatched.

Then we have base, another success for Ethereum because it is a L2. Base supported by Coinbase is basically building a friendly on ramp into the Ethereum ecosystem in a fast, cheap and normie proof way. This is also attracting developers to work on it.

Solana is not far away from them but in other aspects Solana is really far away from Ethereum ecosystem.

It looks like the multi chain dream is evolving into a multi layer Ethereum reality and base might be the layer that takes it mainstream.

The Fed just gave DeFi a golden ticket, welcoming stablecoins, tokenization, and AI to reshape payments. A new “payment account” could unlock direct Fed rail access for compliant firms. Ethereum’s DeFi dominance is set to soar, and altcoins? They’re not dead, they’re gearing up for a massive comeback.

Fed Governor Waller declared a “new era” where DeFi isn’t the enemy, it’s a partner. Stablecoins, tokenization, and AI are now on the Fed‘s radar, with hands-on research to back it up. A proposed “payment account”, a capped, no frills master account for eligible firms. This means faster fiat, stablecoin swaps, smoother on/off-ramps, and tokenized payments on overdrive. Fed Rails Open Up a streamlined account (no interest, no overdrafts) could slash friction for DeFi players, making rails accessible to innovators.

* AI + Payments: The Fed’s hyped on AI for fraud, risk, and routing, perfect for programmable L1s and L2s like Ethereum.

The Fed’s pivot is a lifeline for altcoins, but don’t expect an overnight moon. This is a builder’s rally, not a meme coin pump. Smart contract L1s and L2s think Solana, ADA, Polygon, Avalanche, ... stand to gain as DeFi gets regulatory clarity and better rails. Stablecoin and tokenization projects (Chainlink, Polkadot, …) could thrive as tokenized assets scale. Be patient, altcoins need time to align with compliance, build infrastructure, and ride Ethereum’s coattails. The season’s brewing, and late 2025 or 2026 could be explosive for projects that play this right.

Why Not Bitcoin? BTC’s a store of value, not a DeFi workhorse. This is about programmable chains and compliant infrastructure, Ethereum and altcoins are the real winners. The Fed isn’t just okay with DeFi, it’s inviting it to rebuild the payment system. This is the state saying, “Get on our rails, now!” Ethereum’s DeFi giants and scrappy altcoins are ready to seize this moment.

What’s Next? This is exploration, not policy, hold the confetti. But the Fed’s moving fast, and DeFi’s in the driver’s seat. Watch Ethereum, compliant stablecoins, and altcoins building for the long game. Altcoin season is coming, the fuse is lit.

I see some other altcoin as the future.,"Bitcoin is not perfect. You know this because it is only known as a store of value. It is way too slow in transaction speed and expensive to be implemented as a world payment system. Bitcoin is not scalable and its developers left the project so it can’t be upgraded.

For those reasons, I think most of the world and  bitcoin maxis are just delusional or uneducated about the other coins that are as secure and decentralized while being faster/scalable. 

Many people think bitcoin will hit $1 million. I only see that happening not because bitcoin is the best, but because it had first mover advantage, it’s a house name, and many have invested so much in it already that it makes it seem like it’s too big to fail. Sure it’s the safest investment but that’s only because it has so much liquidity based on hype not actual functionality besides being a store of value.

Most people in crypto are in it to make money and not because they care about the actual fundamentals and technology.

I see some other altcoin as the future. Bitcoin is not perfect. You know this because it is only known as a store of value. It is way too slow in transaction speed and expensive to be implemented as a world payment system. Bitcoin is not scalable and its developers left the project so it can’t be upgraded.

For those reasons, I think most of the world and  bitcoin maxis are just delusional or uneducated about the other coins that are as secure and decentralized while being faster/scalable. 

Many people think bitcoin will hit $1 million. I only see that happening not because bitcoin is the best, but because it had first mover advantage, it’s a house name, and many have invested so much in it already that it makes it seem like it’s too big to fail. Sure it’s the safest investment but that’s only because it has so much liquidity based on hype not actual functionality besides being a store of value.

Most people in crypto are in it to make money and not because they care about the actual fundamentals and technology.

Bitcoin often topped within 2 months before Fed Chair end of term and, selloff into bear market a month after new Fed Chair or new term. That doesn’t cause the move but those windows come with policy headlines and shifting expectations, which markets react to.

Timeline:

Late 2013 to early 2014 (Bernanke step down Yellen start)

* BTC cycle top: Dec 2013 ($1.2k).
* Chair change: Jan 31, 2014 Bernanke ends, Feb 3, 2014 Yellen starts (2 months after the BTC cycle top).
* What followed: a sharp monthly drop of 32% arrived in March 2014 (1 month after).

Late 2017 to early 2018 (Yellen step down Powell start)

* BTC cycle top: Dec 2017 ($19.7k).
* Chair change: Feb 3 to 5, 2018 Yellen ends, Powell starts (2 months after the BTC cycle top).
* What followed: another steep monthly selloff 33% in March 2018(1 month after).

Late 2021 to mid 2022 (Powell term renewal)

* BTC late cycle high: Nov 2021 (\~$69k).
* Chair milestone: first term ended on Feb 5th 2022 (2.5 months); second term was delayed and confirmed on May 2022 (during the shift to rate hikes/QT).
* What followed: the bear market accelerated into a 37% red candle June 2022( again 1 month after).

Why the Fed Chair Matters for Bitcoin:

The U.S. dollar dominates global finance, used in 88% of transactions and 59% of reserves, making the Fed’s monetary policy a key driver of Bitcoin’s price. The Fed controls liquidity via interest rates and QE/QT. Loose policy boosts risk assets like Bitcoin, tight policy suppresses them. Inflation fears also fuel Bitcoin’s “digital gold” appeal. The Fed Chair leads the FOMC, setting policy tone and expectations. A new Chair in 2026 could signal policy shifts, impacting Bitcoin’s volatility. While Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, its trading environment is fiat driven, tying its cycles to Fed actions.

Future Outlook:

Powell’s second term ends May 23, 2026. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could peak around Feb or March 2026 (2+ months prior), potentially followed by a bear market in June 2026, marked by a 30\~40% correction. However, external factors like regulation or global events could shift timelines.

my risk metric isn’t flagging a hot zone (80-100) for Bitcoin this cycle yet, we might still have time. Currently BTC 110k = risk 48 over 100.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oeim8n/bitcoin_cycles_fed_chair_timelines_no_crystal_ball/,,8.0,4.0,0.72,1761262368.0,hduynam99,"I made a post on here recently basically stating that I could see the actual top go into Q1 of 2026. A lot of the crypto bros this cycle seem to really be obsessing about the 4 year cycle having a top that is within a very specific time from, I've seen it from both the halving AND from the bottom. Based on this, we would have topped by now, which I think is highly unlikely. Last cycle, we actually peaked spring of 2021, which did not invalidate the 4 year cycle. 

We recently had the biggest liquidation even in crypto history not too long ago, which would have been an equivalent of the COVID scare March 2020 and the collapse in the market after the collapse of FTX in November of 2022. There was heavy fear in the market, yet BTC is/was still trading above 100k. In addition to this, we have a wave of ETFs that will soon be approved, more rate cuts and the start of QE sometime in the near future. It just doesn't make much sense for us NOT to have another leg up or for us to have already topped and be in the early stages of the bear market. 

I think BTC has already had the vast majority of it's gains for this cycle, but I think the huge action will be with the alts, which still really haven't been doing much overall. 

I think the reason why people are so fearful/bearish is because they were overexposed to alts, most likely bought at incorrect moments in this cycle, while being underexposed to BTC.",t3_1oeim8n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bitcoin Cycles & Fed Chair Timelines (no crystal ball) https://preview.redd.it/h40ps9d55ywf1.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=14c80eab4739a744d9b603f940cd0549cf8d35a5

# Crypto Futures | Warning, Warning!

You already read the warning above and understand that this is not financial advice at all. In fact, this goes beyond warning, and I request you not try it if you haven’t ever tried the Futures market.

https://preview.redd.it/xx6h8vd0lvwf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1194a8db82120229ba003239d9fb8448f286dd14

For your information, I lost USD 20,000 before I even understood how Futures work. Then I lost another USD 1,200 (in INR) on CoinDCX (Indian Crypto Exchange) before I got an idea of how to get it right in Futures. So, I urge you not to try this if you have no clue what the Futures market is all about.

Now that the warning is out of the way, let’s dive straight in.

# To The Futures Players | And the Stalwarts | And the Veterans

So, I keep playing in the Futures market on CoinDCX, and I have some investments on GateIO. I trade on GateIO and play Futures on CoinDCX. In both cases, BTC is common.

Here is something interesting I observed:

1. The price of BTC on GateIO is 50-100 dollars higher than on CoinDCX. I presume this is due to the Exchange’s formulae of averaging the price of BTC on the major exchanges.  
2. Whatever the case, at any given point in time, the difference is at least 50 USD.  
3. And when the price is fast-moving, the difference goes up to 100 USD. I am yet to witness a bigger difference than this. So, safely assume it is between USD 50 and 100.  
4. Now, the regular trader may think of arbitrage, but I don’t think arbitrage will work that fast, or maybe it will with bots. I don’t know, and it is not something I am interested in. You can still check it out. But there is something more, and that is the fun part.  
5. If you are a Futures player who plays scalping or day trading, then you are always asking the question of which direction the price is moving.  
6. However, if you are both on CoinDCX and GateIO, then you can look at the price on GateIO, and whatever the price is, you know the price on CoinDCX is going to be 50 to 100 USD less.  
7. You can look at the direction of trade (increasing or decreasing) and go and buy a Long or Short contract on CoinDCX.  
8. I recommend trying with small amounts first until you get the hang of it. Once you get the hang, buy Long or Short and close the contract when you achieve 10, 20, or even 50% profit on your position.  
9. It is working like a charm for me, and I am loving it completely.

That’s it. That’s the trick.

# Words of Caution | Be Smart About the Trick

This will not work if you see an extremely fast movement of the Bitcoin price upwards or downwards. Why? Because by the time you buy the contract (Long or Short), the price could have reversed, leading to losses.

I have tried this with Bitcoin, but it should work with any coin/token. I recommend not taking a chance with other tokens if you have no idea of their price movements. Bitcoin is easy. Others may not be.

That’s it. So try it out at your own peril!! 😊

I’m working on a project where I need to build an automated system that can determine the price of a cryptocurrency at the exact time a client’s transaction occurred. The idea is simple: for each transaction, take the coin and timestamp, and fetch the corresponding USD price at that moment.

For this, I’m looking for datasets that provide **historical cryptocurrency prices**

* Coin name or symbol
* Timestamp of the price
* Price in USD

Minute-level resolution or better would be ideal, as cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate rapidly. Datasets can be in CSV, JSON, Parquet. It would be great if the data covers a wide range of coins, not just Bitcoin or Ethereum, since client transactions could involve altcoins as well.

If anyone has access to such datasets, whether public, private, or via an API, I’d greatly appreciate it if you could share it. Any tips on working with large historical crypto datasets efficiently would also be helpful.

I don't know how that actually happens.  Who agrees with change in the model and how does this protocol change get pushed out?

Here's a few challenges bitcoin has to deal with eventually.
1.  There's a rate limit on the number of transactions.  So either the number of transactions per epoch or the rate of epochs needs to go up by hundreds of fold to be similar to say Visa.  In particular workarounds like lightning network evidently have a model flaw in that it becomes unviable as bitcoin transitions from mining based to fee based.

2. Moving to quantum resistant signatures.

3.  Reducing the cost of mining without losing the security model of cost based (paid in energy) Mining.  Presumably this looks like proof of stake

It's way harder to change Bitcoin than most blockchains because the community is extremely conservative about modifications.

Changes get implemented through either soft forks which are backward compatible, or hard forks which split the network if everyone doesn't upgrade. Soft forks need miner signaling to activate, hard forks need everyone to adopt the new rules or you end up with competing chains like Bitcoin Cash.

For your specific points, Bitcoin adding smart contracts is limited compared to Ethereum. It has basic scripting for things like multisig and timelocks but not general computation. Moving to proof of stake is basically impossible because the community fundamentally rejects it as less secure than proof of work. That's not happening.

Transaction throughput is a real limitation. Lightning Network helps but you're right that it has scaling challenges as the network grows. Our clients building on Bitcoin either accept the throughput limits or use Lightning despite its tradeoffs. Base layer Bitcoin isn't going to 100x transaction speed because larger blocks create centralization.

Quantum resistance is a legitimate future concern but not urgent yet. When quantum computers actually threaten current cryptography, Bitcoin can upgrade signature schemes through a soft fork. The tech exists, it just needs consensus to implement when necessary.

The governance model is intentionally slow and conservative. Major changes take years of debate and testing. Bitcoin's value comes partly from being hard to change, which makes it predictable and resistant to capture by any single group.",t3_1ocn0su,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Questions about how bitcoin evolves I have heard that bitcoin can evolve its model .

The rise of ridiculous meme coins and scams is detrimental to seeing any adoption I feel and certainly off putting to people wanting to get involved - and you need security for that to become common.

I have funds on exchanges because it’s the most accessible and for me easiest way - and if say for 99% of people if you want a general person to great involved that’s the best way then a cold wallet which security wise makes sense but isn’t as user friendly as a exchange.

I see it as an investment and feel most other people and companies do too as do other people my age I know. I don’t know anyone in offline who sees it as a currency replacement say and I see some tiny places taking payment for a coffee with BTC online but I think that’s just a waste of it considering fees and such but hey ho.

Is it more the tech being behind adapted by banks that’s happening and due moreso than the coins themselves? I think it’s more likely we get a national digital currency then say the UK adopting BTC - they need to be in control of it for obvious reasons..

With more people using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital coins for gaming, new crypto casino platforms are launching almost every month. But with so many options, it’s becoming harder to tell which ones are actually worth using.

Every crypto casino claims to offer fast payouts, provably fair games, and anonymous transactions, but once you start playing, the truth often looks very different.

Some of the most talked-about cryptocurrency casinos right now include:

Titantreasure

Jackbit

mbit

Stake

All of them advertise “guaranteed fairness,” “premium bonuses,” and “next-gen blockchain transparency.” But when you dig a little deeper, it’s not always clear how fair the odds actually are, or whether the games are designed to keep you spinning until your wallet runs dry.

A big question in the crypto casino community right now is how transparent and provably fair these sites really are. Most claim to use blockchain verification for their casino games — but do players actually check those proofs, or do we just take the site’s word for it?

It’s also worth looking at how these platforms handle withdrawals and live betting. Some crypto casinos advertise instant payouts, but in practice, delays, withdrawal limits, or extra verification steps are still common. And when you’re dealing with crypto volatility, a delay of even a few hours can make a big difference in the value of your winnings.

I’m genuinely curious, has anyone here actually made consistent profits or had a positive long-term experience with cryptocurrency online casinos? Have you found any sites that truly live up to the “provably fair” promise and make cashing out simple and fast?

Or is crypto gambling more about the entertainment factor, the thrill, the technology, and the community, rather than expecting to walk away ahead in the long run?

If you’ve tried multiple platforms, which crypto casinos do you trust most in 2025? Which ones deliver smooth, fair gameplay. which look great on the surface but disappoint once you start wagering real crypto?

Here’s the thing. Bitcoin’s security relies on elliptic-curve cryptography. That’s what keeps your private keys safe and prevents anyone from forging transactions. The issue is that a powerful quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could, in theory, break ECC. That means it could figure out your private key just from your public key.

We’re not there yet. Quantum computers today aren’t strong enough, but researchers estimate it might take around a million stable qubits to break Bitcoin’s encryption. The scary part is that companies like IBM and Google are already making steady progress toward that.

And here’s what makes it even more interesting: some governments and major banks are already preparing for the quantum threat. They’re quietly transitioning to post-quantum encryption standards ahead of time. Makes you wonder if they know something the public doesn’t.

Then there’s the store now, decrypt later problem. Hackers could already be saving blockchain data, planning to decrypt it once the tech catches up. That could make old BTC addresses and reused keys vulnerable down the line.

Because those people don't understand how money works. Bitcoin sucks as a currency.

>Does that not make the fed useless and ultimately prevent them from making any money at all?

No. Reserve asset =/= money in circulation. The purpose of a reserve asset is to provide a base of value so that if people want to trade in another currency for it, they can. Which gives them confidence in that other currency's value.

The US dollar is the world's reserve currency because its value is backed by the stability and power of the US. Other countries' central banks hold US dollars so that their citizens can be confident that if their local currency becomes unstable, they can just trade in their local currency to their government for US dollars.

>Better yet why does any country need a central bank? Cant the govt print and manage its own money?

No, because governments are incentivized to keep spending.

Let’s cut through the Uptober hype with some cold, hard data. You’ve got a chart of Bitcoin monthly returns and you’re eyeing October. From 2013 to 2024, October closed green 10/12 times (only 2014 and 2018 were red). If this month Oct-2025 closes red, that’s 3/13 about 23% odds of a down month. Nice edge, sure, but not destiny.

The seasonal probability 70/30:

In traditional markets, many calendar effects win around 60-70% of the time over long samples, good, but far from guaranteed. Two well studied examples: the Halloween indicator (“Sell in May”) shows higher Nov-Apr returns across many markets, but not every year, updated research still finds persistence, not certainty. Likewise, the turn of the month effect concentrates a big chunk of average monthly return into a few days, yet it also fails regularly. In short, seasonality is probabilistic, think 70/30, not 100/0.

Reality check:

markets don’t care about calendars, they care about cycles, liquidity, and macro. If we’re in a prolonged consolidation (post-halving churn, shifting policy), that \~23% downside month isn’t some anomaly, it’s the cost of playing a probabilistic edge. The log trend can stay intact while October still prints red.

Bottom line:

Use seasonality as context, not a trigger. Based on my risk metric, BTC $109K = risk 48. It's still under 50 and today is Sunday. I'm DCAing in, sticking to my plan.

Traditionally crypto enthusiasts have been responding with ""The world will have much bigger problems if RSA or ECC is cracked."" which is funny when you think about it, because out of all the big & high stake systems you could attack,  a crypto network would likely be one of the first, simply because attacking other big & high stake systems has a higher risk of sending you to jail.

For the first time in several years, the story, the data, and the execution all align. POL’s market capitalization grew 39.2% quarter over quarter to $2.36 billion dollars, outperforming the broader crypto market, which rose by 20%. Network activity, institutional participation, and technical upgrades all moved forward in sync.

What excites me most about this report is that it validates what many of us who follow Polygon closely have been sensing. After a few years of searching for direction, Polygon has rediscovered its identity and is executing with focus. The growth across payments, real-world assets, and interoperability shows a network building for real adoption rather than temporary hype.

History Lesson - Polygon was one of the most prominent blockchains during 2021 and 2022. Back then, MATIC was a household name in crypto. DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and gaming applications all flocked to Polygon. It was fast, cheap, and part of Ethereum’s scaling future.

Then the market cooled, prices dropped, and Polygon’s identity blurred. It continued shipping technology, but the narrative was less defined. The ecosystem became large, but scattered, and the token’s performance reflected that uncertainty.

In 2025, that changed. Polygon refocused around two themes with real-world traction: payments and real-world assets. This focus unified its ecosystem under one clear goal of building the financial and transactional backbone for onchain economies. The Messari data shows that this strategy is working. Stablecoin growth, institutional partnerships, and infrastructure upgrades are moving together.

The chain has a strong foundation and a clear direction. The 39% market-cap surge in Q3 is the first tangible signal that the market recognizes that turnaround. To me, it feels like the beginning of Polygon’s second act.

The market performance in Q3 represents renewed confidence in execution. POL now ranks as the second-largest Ethereum Layer 2 token by market capitalization, behind Mantle and ahead of Arbitrum, Optimism, and Immutable. More than 99% of the supply has transitioned from MATIC to POL, completing one of the largest token migrations in the industry.

Polygon’s outperformance is supported by onchain metrics. Daily active addresses increased by 13%, daily transactions rose 20%, and the average transaction fee declined by 23% in POL terms. These metrics indicate expanding usage and improving efficiency at the same time.

When I look at these numbers, I see a market beginning to price real fundamentals again. The price action is following execution, which is what sustainable growth looks like.

Polygon’s payments ecosystem is one of the strongest indicators of real adoption. In Q3, stablecoin supply increased 22% to $2.94 billion. USDT alone grew 35% to $1.4B, while USDC maintained close to $1B.

More importantly, those stablecoins are being used. Payments-focused applications on Polygon facilitated $1.82B in transaction volume across more than 50 platforms during the quarter, up 49% from Q2.

Polygon has also become a hub for innovative payments infrastructure. What excites me most about this growth is that it represents genuine economic activity. They are transfers, purchases, and settlements happening on a scalable blockchain that costs a fraction of a cent per transaction. This is what a functional onchain payments network looks like.

If payments show real consumer traction, real-world assets show that institutions are taking Polygon seriously. The total value of tokenized RWAs on Polygon reached $1.14B (recently grew to $1.6B last week) by the end of Q3. The issuers include government agencies, state banks, and regulated financial entities.

Germany’s NRW Bank issued a 100 million euro bond on Polygon under electronic securities law. Spain’s BeToken launched one of Europe’s first fully regulated equity token offerings. The Philippines Department of Budget and Management implemented a blockchain-based system to track public funds, improving transparency in government spending. Justoken launched tokens backed by physical commodities such as soybeans and soybean oil, with a combined value of over $450M.

These projects mark a shift from experimentation to production. Institutions are using Polygon for financial instruments that carry legal and regulatory weight. This is the kind of adoption that builds long-term credibility. When state banks and government agencies issue assets on a public chain, it changes the perception of blockchain entirely.

For me, this is one of the most exciting parts of the Polygon story in 2025. Real capital is entering the ecosystem, and it is doing so on Polygon because of its reliability, low cost, and Ethereum alignment.

While institutional adoption is accelerating, developer momentum has been equally strong. Polygon ranks fourth in global blockchain developer interest in 2025, behind Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. This shows that the ecosystem continues to attract new builders even as competition increases.

The Agglayer Incubator Program has become a central piece of this growth. The Agglayer connects multiple chains into a unified liquidity network, creating an environment where assets and users move seamlessly between ecosystems. 

Several breakout projects have emerged from this initiative. Katana, a DeFi-optimized Layer 2 chain, launched earlier this year with deep liquidity and sustainable yield mechanisms. Miden continues to advance zero-knowledge virtual machine research. Billions focuses on institutional DeFi infrastructure, while other projects explore areas such as onchain identity and privacy.

This expanding network of independent but interoperable chains is what sets Polygon apart in 2025. It is not competing to be a single chain; it is building an interconnected ecosystem under the Agglayer framework.

Polygon’s resurgence is also visible in its community engagement. **On October 1, 2025, Polygon became the first blockchain to formally sponsor and participate in** r/CryptoCurrency **as a Community Sponsor.** They are officially a sponsor of this subreddit and have distributed $5000 in POL rewards to users of the sub.

According to Surf AI’s (another AMA participant) sentiment analysis, Polygon leads all Layer 2 solutions in positive Reddit discussions, with 78 percent bullish mentions compared to 62 percent for competitors. This shows that sentiment around Polygon has turned positive again as users see progress across the ecosystem.

The renewed focus on education and open communication reflects Polygon’s effort to focusing meaningfully in crypto communities and cultures. I view this community alignment as a strong sign of maturity.

Several major developments this quarter have strengthened Polygon’s position further.

* **Institutional Staking:** AMINA Bank launched regulated POL staking on October 9, 2025, offering compliant yield opportunities for institutional investors. This could unlock large amounts of capital from entities that have been waiting for regulatory clarity.
* **Polymarket Expansion:** Polymarket, one of the most active applications on Polygon, saw its trading volume increase tenfold year over year in 2025. It now represents a significant share of Polygon’s DeFi activity and recently completed a $2B raise at a $9B valuation.
* **Developer and Institutional Leadership:** Polygon continues to attract developers and enterprises alike through programs such as the Agglayer Incubator.
* **Vitalik Buterin’s Endorsement:** In mid-October 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin publicly praised Polygon’s contributions to Ethereum scalability and its early leadership in zero-knowledge research.

One of the most exciting developments this week is Polygon Labs’ collaboration with Manifold Trading, a quantitative investment firm specializing in institutional-grade liquidity. This partnership represents a major leap toward professional market standards in decentralized finance.

Manifold will bring data-driven liquidity management, quantitative market-making, and tighter spreads to Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem. In traditional markets, firms like Manifold ensure smooth execution and consistent pricing across venues. That structure has largely been missing in DeFi, where liquidity often sits idle or fragmented across decentralized exchanges.

By applying institutional execution practices to onchain markets, Polygon and Manifold are building a system that offers predictable depth and lower slippage. For context, compressing the spread on a one-million-dollar trade from 50 basis points to 5 basis points can save more than 4,000 dollars in execution costs. Scaled across billions in trading volume, these efficiencies make DeFi truly investable at institutional scale.

Manifold’s strategies will operate across Polygon’s major decentralized exchanges to harmonize pricing and ensure new markets launch with meaningful depth from day one.

For fintechs and neobanks exploring onchain payments or tokenized asset trading, the benefits are immediate. Polygon’s network can now deliver the execution quality and stability of traditional financial systems while maintaining the transparency and openness of DeFi.

This is a direct extension of the vision Polygon has been building toward all year. With infrastructure capable of 5,000-plus transactions per second, sub-five-second finality, and unified cross-chain liquidity through the Agglayer, the network is becoming a full-stack solution for global payments and institutional finance. The Manifold partnership makes that vision tangible by turning liquidity itself into an institutional-grade product.

Polygon’s infrastructure progress has been equally important. The Bhilai Hardfork, Heimdall v2, and Rio Testnet upgrades have all delivered major performance improvements.

The Bhilai Hardfork increased throughput to over 1,000 transactions per second, raised the block gas limit, and implemented account abstraction through EIP-7702. Heimdall v2 reduced transaction finality from one to two minutes down to approximately five seconds by upgrading the consensus layer. The Rio Testnet, which is moving toward mainnet, introduces stateless verification and validator redesigns that could enable up to 5,000 transactions per second.

Polygon also launched Agglayer CDK Enterprise, a toolkit that allows institutions to deploy privacy-enabled EVM chains that remain interoperable with the main ecosystem. This combination of scalability, privacy, and interoperability is a major step toward institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure.

Average transaction fees have dropped to roughly 0.0027 dollars, making Polygon one of the most efficient networks in the space. For payments and RWAs, those economics are critical.

Polygon’s 2025 story is one of renewal. The network has moved from a period of uncertainty to a position of clear strength. Its focus on payments, real-world assets, and interoperability has created measurable growth across both retail and institutional segments.

The community is re-engaged, the developer base is expanding, and institutions are beginning to trust Polygon for real financial applications. The Messari report captures this turning point with data, but the larger narrative is about execution and focus.

The 39% rise in market capitalization in Q3 is, in my view, only an early indication of what lies ahead. Polygon has rebuilt its foundation, aligned its strategy with real demand, and positioned itself at the center of Ethereum’s scaling ecosystem. If the current trajectory continues, Polygon could become one of the most important networks in the next phase of blockchain adoption.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oil6xd/polygon_has_supported_this_subreddit_a_lot_and_im/,,0.0,20.0,0.41,1761684911.0,002_timmy,[removed],t3_1oil6xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Polygon has supported this subreddit a lot and I'm insanely bullish - A deep dive on what Polygon has been up to The Messari Q3 report on Polygon (here: [https://messari.io/report/state-of-polygon-q3-2025](https://messari.io/report/state-of-polygon-q3-2025)) is the strongest confirmation yet that the network has regained momentum.

* Since 2014, 44% of all processed crypto payments have been made in Bitcoin.
* It remains the #1 payment method in 2025, accounting for 22.7% of all transactions this year, followed by USDT (19.8%), LTC (14%) and USDC (11.5%).
* During the 2022 bear market, BTC payment volume still grew by +41.7%, proving that adoption doesn’t stop when the price dips.
* Between 2018-2025, 6% of all BTC payments were processed through the Lightning Network layer. This year, LN makes up 11.7% of BTC transactions, enabling faster and cheaper checkouts.
* Bitcoin is most often spent on web hosting, consumer services, and VPNs, industries where global access is most crucial.
* The average order size is €132, ranging from microtransactions to large purchases like travel and tech.
* More merchants are holding collected BTC (25.9%) from sales instead of converting it, the highest level since 2022.

BTC fees have been a major problem several times in the coin's history. These days it seems that BTC utilization is down, so fees remain fairly low. Miners need those fees to remain profitable as the block reward keeps halving. If price doesn't double by the next halving, some miners will be forced to go bankrupt. So keeping blocks full and transactions up is vital to keeping fees high. As of today, the average BTC fee is less than $1 per transaction, while miners' energy cost is surely more than that. Maybe this is why the Core devs are allowing larger amounts data in BTC transactions via Taproot and removing OP\_RETURN limits, as they'll fill up the blocks and increase fees artificially?

* Integration brings onchain fund distribution to 4.5k financial institutions in 58 markets
* Polygon’s sub-cent fees and near-instant finality make large-scale institutional settlement practical onchain
* Calastone is a major step toward bringing onchain capital markets built on scalable, transparent infrastructure

Calastone, the global funds network that processes more than £250 billion in transactions each month, is launching its tokenized fund distribution solution on Polygon, the go-to stack powering global money movement, supporting sending billions in value, instantly. 

The integration brings institutional-scale fund distribution onchain, enabling asset managers to operate fund share classes directly over blockchain rails while maintaining the administrative and compliance processes they already use. 

This marks one of the first large-scale integrations of blockchain into global fund infrastructure. Calastone’s adoption of Polygon provides a model for how tokenization can modernize asset distribution. With Polgyon’s rails, Calastone reduces intermediaries, expands cross-border access, and enhances transparency without disrupting compliance or custody standards.

Polygon delivers the scale, Ethereum compatibility, and cost efficiency that global institutions need to operate onchain, without sacrificing trust or performance.

By launching tokenized fund share classes on Polygon, Calastone unlocks new pathways for both institutional and retail investors. Asset managers can reach digital-first investor pools globally, while blockchain transparency and automation simplify settlement and reconciliation across jurisdictions.

The integration also signals a broader shift underway: the migration of traditional capital markets onto public, open infrastructure. As Polygon’s Rio and Heimdall upgrades bring speeds of up to 5,000 TPS and instant finality, the network continues to position itself as the go-to chain for institutional-grade payments and tokenized assets.

So this will be confusing as the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is similar to the influencer’s name (icobeast). I will do my best to refer to the influencer with his full name. 

For background on the ICO: MegaETH's public token sale ran from October 28 to October 31, 2025, offering 500 million MEGA tokens, which was 5% of the total 10 billion supply, at a valuation that attracted over $1.4 billion in commitments for just $50 million worth of tokens, resulting in a staggering 28x oversubscription. Icobeast, a well-known figure in the space for his airdrop farming guides, reviews of projects, and history of securing large allocations in high-profile launches, was awarded a significant portion valued at approximately $1 million based on pre-market pricing.

The terms of the ICO were clear and uncompromising: Participants agreed to a one-year lock-up period on their tokens, with explicit prohibitions against any form of hedging, shorting, or over-the-counter (OTC) trading. Additionally, the agreement barred public statements on social media or elsewhere discussing intentions to sell, hedge, or otherwise mitigate risk, as these could undermine the project's goal of fostering long-term commitment from holders rather than short-term speculators.

The trigger was icobeast’s tweet on November 9, 2025: “At current pre-market prices my MegaETH ICO allocation is worth nearly $1 million dollars. I need to figure out how to hedge this.” The post went viral within crypto circles, amassing thousands of likes and replies debating the ethics of such transparency. Less than 24 hours later, icobeast followed up with: “My allocation has been revoked and is now worth $0,” confirming that MegaETH had enforced the clause by issuing a full refund and reallocating the tokens to other eligible participants.

This isn't the first sign of MegaETH's rigorous approach. MegaETH has emphasized building a ""real-time"" blockchain ecosystem free from the dump-and-run dynamics that plague many token launches. By revoking the allocation, they aimed to preserve scarcity and align incentives with genuine builders and users.

MegaETH tried to incorporate social scoring and reputation metrics like Ethos into its ICO allocation process to prioritize ""conviction"" over speculation. Allocations in the ""Conviction Round"" were determined algorithmically using onchain activity, wallet age, lock-up commitments, and reputation signals from platforms like Ethos and Kaito, alongside NFT holdings in the MegaETH ecosystem such as Fluffle and Bad Bunnz.

Ethos, a decentralized reputation protocol, assigns trust scores based on on-chain behavior, social contributions, and community feedback, categorizing users as ""trusted,"" ""neutral,"" or ""untrusted."" MegaETH weighted these scores alongside other data to filter for long-term holders, enforcing a one-year lock-up, no-hedging policy, and bans on public discussions of selling or risk mitigation.

icobeast entered with a high Ethos score reflecting positive on-chain engagement and social influence. This earned him an initial allocation valued at nearly $1 million at pre-market prices, positioning him as a top recipient under the system's metrics.

In stark contrast, influencer KookCapitalLLC, who’s known for rugging her followers, received a 94% allocation on her maximum $186,282 bid. This netted her $174,490 to purchase 1,746,644 MEGA tokens. Her Ethos score sits at 357, firmly in the ""untrusted"" tier, stemming from documented patterns of high-volume sales post-hype and public disputes, including rejecting KOL deals and score manipulation allegations.

This has become become super controversial as some praised MegaETH for upholding rules in an oversubscribed sale, others pointed out how a high-reputation participant with a clean Ethos profile loses out over a hypothetical statement, while a low-score figure with a history of alleged follower dumps secures whale status.

This is getting geopolitical fast.

The Bitcoin was originally stolen from Chinas LuBian mining pool back in December 2020. At the time it was worth about 3.5 billion but the hack did not get much mainstream attention. The coins then sat in the attacker’s wallets for years and only started moving in mid 2024 before ending up in addresses that analysts and China’s report now link to US authorities, and that the DOJ says it controls as of the seizure announced in October 2025.

Chinas argument is that normal criminals would cash out immediately. The fact these coins stayed dormant for about four years points to a state level operation not some random hacker looking for quick profit. They say the sophistication of the hack and the long dormancy proves it was government orchestrated.

The US Department of Justice seized the Bitcoin in October 2025 as part of a case against Chen Zhi who ran Cambodias Prince Group. They charged him with running a massive crypto fraud and forced labor scam network and said the seizure was a lawful criminal proceeds forfeiture. The DOJ has explicitly denied China’s “state level hack” accusation and says it had no involvement in the original theft.

Heres the thing tho. Chen Zhi apparently sent multiple messages on chain basically begging the hackers to return the Bitcoin and offering ransom. The hackers never responded which is weird if they were just criminals.

this batch of bitcoin now represents about 39 percent of all btc held by the us government based on on chain tracking of us controlled addresses… for what it’s worth, stuff like this is why i keep my own provenance tidy...i tag deposits and reconcile basis monthly in awaken.tax so if a wallet or cluster hits the news i can quickly see whether my coins ever touched that flow

Built on **EigenCompute**, part of the EigenLayer ecosystem, it connects an ordinary Web2 escrow service to Ethereum’s validator-backed trust model.

It’s a small project, but it represents something big: the extension of Ethereum’s security into the off-chain world.

The demo uses a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) backend and Privy authentication, letting users sign in through standard Web2 methods while the core logic settles verifiably on Ethereum. Developers can fork the repository, deploy it through the EigenX CLI, and run a service that looks like a normal web app but operates under the same type of trust guarantees that secure the Ethereum network.

What this shows is more than a technical trick. It is a working demonstration of a new design pattern for how trust itself can be built, reused, and extended.

# 1. Practical verifiability for Web2

Instead of launching new blockchains or validator networks, developers can now anchor traditional applications to Ethereum’s existing security. That makes it practical to build verifiable services — like escrows, marketplaces, or data processors — without needing to reinvent the infrastructure of decentralization from scratch.

# 2. ETH as a universal bond

In this model, **ETH becomes the reusable foundation of digital trust**. The same capital that secures Ethereum’s consensus can now back independent services, functioning as a kind of economic bond for integrity. Each new application strengthens the network’s relevance, because its trust ultimately flows from Ethereum’s validators and the collateral they restake.

# 3. Familiar experience, verifiable core

From the user’s perspective, nothing changes — logins, dashboards, and APIs all feel like the Web2 internet. But under the hood, execution happens in verifiable environments, and outcomes can be proven on-chain. This merges convenience with verifiability instead of forcing a choice between them.

# 4. Broader implications

If this pattern spreads, it could reshape how the internet handles trust.  
Developers might stop creating new chains for every new idea and instead **reuse Ethereum’s validator base** to secure services directly. A whole market could form around *renting* Ethereum’s trust, where validators, restakers, and developers price and trade cryptographic assurance itself.

It also means that the boundary between Web2 and Web3 could fade. The same Ethereum security that once applied only to smart contracts could start underpinning AI models, databases, and cloud apps, without users even realizing it.

# 5. A shift in Ethereum’s role

Rollups and data blobs scaled Ethereum’s capacity to process transactions. EigenLayer and applications like compute-escrow-privy scale something different: **its trust model**. Ethereum’s reach is no longer confined to blockchains — it’s becoming a **base layer for verifiable computation**.

Whether this model becomes a standard is uncertain, but its direction is clear. Ethereum’s trust is beginning to extend beyond its own chain, out into the rest of the internet.

I joined the industry for its ideals. It took years - and a few hard lessons - to unlearn them.

# Not About Memes or Casinos

This post is about projects trying to *create* value, not extract it. Those building new rails, not just running the same casino onchain.

Memes and casinos have their own kind of Product-Market-Fit. They entertain, they speculate, they move money. But they don’t *build*. They redistribute value rather than generate it.

**In short, this post is about teams growing the pie, not just grabbing the bigger slice.**

*Now that the disclaimer’s out of the way, let’s get into it.*

# Changing My Mind

I first dipped my toes into crypto in 2016, back when Vitalik would reply to my tweets or answer my technical questions on Gitter. For the past four years, I’ve been all in, building full-time.

That transition, from observer to participant, is when you start facing real tradeoffs. It’s when you stop quoting whitepapers and start debugging production systems. And it’s when your ideals begin to meet reality.

Below are examples I often bring up when discussing how **pragmatism (not purity) led to success.** These are companies I’ve been learning from.

# Pragmatic Successes

[**PolyMarket**](https://www.polymarket.com/) proved that stablecoins beat custom tokens for early traction in prediction markets. Back in 2016, [Augur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur_(software)) and [Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io/blog/ten-years-of-gnosis-from-prediction-markets-to-a-user-owned-open-finance-revolution) kicked off the decentralized prediction markets ecosystem. Most people today haven’t heard of Augur, and know Gnosis mainly as a multisig or credit card company. But, everyone’s heard of PolyMarket, especially after their [$2B raise at a $9B valuation](https://insights4vc.substack.com/p/polymarket-raises-2b-at-9b-valuation). Their key move was focusing on product over tokenomics, avoiding getting [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by shiny ideals.

[**Solana**](https://www.solana.com/) showed that choosing speed over decentralization can capture real users. Solana’s vision was to run at the speed of the Nasdaq onchain. One of crypto’s deepest ideals is that anyone should be able to run a node or validator at home, in their basement, on a laptop, as part of the network’s collective strength. In practice, running a Solana validator requires professional-grade hardware and DevOps skills. It’s like needing to be an F1 driver just to commute to work. Solana made the hard tradeoff of centralization for performance, and it paid off. With a \~$91B market cap, pragmatism clearly won.

**Stablecoins** became crypto’s paradoxical success by embracing regulation and existing rails. Bitcoin dreamed of divorcing from the existing financial system; stablecoins married it. Now they’re on track for [$46T in annual volume](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2025/), with [Circle](https://www.circle.com/) IPOing and the [GENIUS Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582/text) adding clarity. They’re as anti-crypto-ideal as it gets, and yet, not showing any signs of slowing down.

[**Coinbase**](https://www.coinbase.com/) thrived by offering custody and compliance instead of maximalist purity. Crypto said: *Not your keys, not your coins.* Coinbase said: *Most people don’t want to manage keys.* They made the pragmatic choice to build for real users, not ideals, and onboarded millions because of it.

[**Privy**](https://www.privy.io/) is arguably one of the most successful wallets in crypto. Its mission is to bring people onchain, and I’ve heard dozens of founders say it’s the best thing that’s happened to the industry in years. Yet it doesn’t have a token, it isn’t *“crypto-native,”* and it relies heavily on AWS to store user keys \[1\]. Its CEO and co-founder, [Henri Stern](https://sequoiacap.com/founder/henri-stern/), spent four years as a protocol research engineer at FileCoin, a project that embodied true crypto ideals. That experience likely gave him a clear sense of when decentralization helps and when it only slows you down. Privy succeeded by focusing on the user experience over crypto ideals.

**In crypto, pragmatism isn’t about compromise, it’s about sequencing. You can decentralize later. You can tokenize later. But you have to survive in the beginning.**

# It’s Never That Simple

Failure can hinge on one thing. Success demands a harmonic symphony: UI, UX, timing, execution, luck. All must play in tune.

Most people in the OG crypto space start with ideals. That’s good as it draws in smart, mission-driven people. But idealism alone doesn’t build resilient systems.

**Pragmatism doesn’t guarantee success. Idealism often guarantees failure.**

The only true exceptions? Bitcoin and Ethereum. \[2\]

# A Thought to End On

**Decentralization is a byproduct of a permissionless and incentivized system.** It’s an end to a means, not a means to an end.

A fully privacy-preserving, decentralized, permissionless world sounds perfect in theory. In practice, it stalls progress, innovation, and usability.

In crypto, as in life, **survival belongs to the pragmatists.**

# tl;dr How to Bias Toward Pragmatism over Idealism

1. **Don’t tokenize too early.** Start with stablecoins or fiat rails.
2. **Don’t decentralize too early.** Use centralized infra, design for later decentralization.
3. **Find Product-Market Fit first.** Once you have PMF, you can afford ideals and earn the right to strive towards them.

MON is the Monad network’s native token, used to pay gas fees, secure the chain via staking, and align validators, developers, and users around the growth of the protocol.*

*Coinbase token sales has provided a platform for the Monad Foundation to distribute MON through a public sale via its subsidiary, MF Services (BVI), Ltd., enabling the purchase of MON tokens right before the launch of Monad Public Mainnet on November 24th, 2025. It will open on Monday, November 17th, 2025 at 9:00 AM ET and run until Saturday, November 22nd, 2025 at 9:00 PM ET. Those interested in learning more or participating in the public sale can do so* [*here*](https://www.coinbase.com/token-sales/monad)*.*

*Monad’s mission is to power a new world economy, suitable for a world that is increasingly online and onchain, through state of the art financial infrastructure. Monad will execute on this vision through three overarching pillars:*

*1. Enabling the Best Experience for Developers*

*2. Global Reach and Impact*

*3. Best-in-Class Technology*

**Monad’s Mission**

On November 24th, the world will witness the culmination of several years of technological innovation and engineering when the Monad Public Mainnet launches along with its native network token, MON. Monad is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain engineered for speed without sacrificing security or decentralization, all while maintaining full compatibility with the existing Ethereum ecosystem.

From the beginning, the Monad team has always been focused on building tomorrow’s tech, today. The mission is to power a new world economy, suitable for a world that is increasingly online and onchain, through state of the art financial infrastructure.

Success requires disruption. The north star is to see the entire global population utilizing applications built on top of Monad. These applications are uniquely enabled and powered by Monad and have the potential to improve lives. An exceptionally performant blockchain that is also decentralized can unlock new app experiences and use cases while also substantially improving the experience of existing ones. However, increased performance without compromising decentralization is the ultimate unlock. It allows for a censorship-resistant blockchain that can withstand the test of time. Operating through intense geopolitical turmoil, banking the unbanked, and serving the needs of global citizens are ideals that have true staying power in an ever-evolving world.

Monad will execute on this vision through three overarching pillars:

1. Enabling the Best Experience for Developers
2. Global Reach and Impact
3. Best-in-Class Technology

**Enabling the Best Experience for Developers**

Monad’s success depends on a thriving ecosystem of applications and developers. This is only possible when Monad is the premier place to build and deploy applications. EVM compatibility already reduces the bulk of friction for developers, but initiatives like [Monad Madness](https://madness.monad.xyz/) and the [Monad Founder Residency](https://residency.monad.xyz/) connected founders with world-class investors to gain invaluable exposure and funding to jumpstart their businesses. Accelerators like [Mach](https://mach.monad.xyz/) expedited the speed at which developers and project teams were able to ship initial proof of concepts and hit the ground running.

Physical spaces like [The Studio](https://x.com/thestudio_xyz) and The Founder Lounge have allowed builders to engage in thoughtful discussions around building startups and exchange valuable knowledge with industry veterans. Meetups organized by Monad community members have created a network of globally distributed advocates for the protocol.

All of these exemplify why the Monad ecosystem is conducive to innovative applications and killer businesses that will drive forward the evolution of Monad’s onchain economy. One that is permissionless and accessible to developers around the world.

**Global Reach and Impact**

While there have been substantial technological improvements across the crypto industry in the past decade, there is still a significant gap to bridge between market needs and the complexity of blockchain technology. The addressable market in crypto will become much larger by meeting users where they are.

This requires global expansion and stronger distribution that is both relevant and accessible. As the number of use cases continues to grow, new audiences and end users are emerging for crypto applications. Financial institutions are increasingly leveraging blockchain technology because of its greater effectiveness compared to legacy systems. Latin America is experiencing an explosion in payments adoption as users migrate online and move towards stablecoins. Southeast Asia is seeing strong growth in enterprise opportunities for blockchains with increasing demand for digital currencies.

We hope to see the Monad ecosystem embed itself across these geographies and userbases to generate the largest impact possible, empowering both developers and users alike. 

**Best-in-Class Technology**

The design of the Monad blockchain centers around the most important vectors for application development:

1. **EVM Compatibility:** Monad is designed to reduce developer friction. Monad’s re-architecture of the EVM perfected the work of predecessors at Ethereum while maintaining easy access to a vast developer ecosystem and tooling. Instead of forcing developers to learn a new programming language, Monad is molded around their needs.
2. **Performance:** Technical innovations like a custom database ([MonadDB](https://monad-docs.vercel.app/monad-arch/execution/monaddb)) and execution optimizations ([Optimistic Parallel Execution](https://blog.monad.xyz/blog/how-monad-works#optimistic-parallel-execution)) have allowed Monad to achieve the speed necessary for mainstream applications. The Monad architecture was designed from the ground up to enable use cases like High-frequency trading (HFT) and consumer applications that were not feasible before due to performance limitations. 
3. **Decentralization:** Performance alone without decentralization opens up a blockchain to censorship concerns. Monad’s new software algorithms and a globally distributed network of validators make the blockchain resistant to censorship while providing durable access to a range of necessary services for users around the world.

The challenge for any blockchain has been the blockchain trilemma: how to optimize for security, scalability, and decentralization while balancing heavy tradeoffs. Instead, Monad solved the blockchain trilemma by pushing the boundaries of what is possible with innovative technology. Our hope is that Monad will only continue to grow more performant and decentralized over time. And now it is time to open Monad up to the world.

**Public sale on Coinbase token sales platform**

Decentralization is only possible with widely distributed ownership of the MON token. A healthy ecosystem consists not only of developers and users, but also tokenholders. We are pleased to share that Coinbase has provided a platform for the Monad Foundation to distribute MON through a [public sale](http://coinbase.com/blog/the-ideal-way-to-launch-introducing-token-sales-on-coinbase) by its subsidiary, MF Services (BVI), Ltd. 

The Coinbase token sales platform brings public sales to retail purchasers in the US and globally, allowing for smaller allocations across more participants. The public sale will enable the purchase of MON tokens right before the launch of Monad Public Mainnet on November 24th, 2025. It will open on Monday, November 17th, 2025 at 9:00 AM ET and run until Saturday, November 22nd, 2025 at 9:00 PM ET.

MON is the Monad network’s native token, used to pay gas fees, secure the chain via staking, and align validators, developers, and users around the growth of the protocol. At the launch of Monad Public Mainnet, the total initial supply of MON will be 100 billion tokens. Up to 7.5B $MON tokens (7.5% of initial token supply) will be made available to the public for purchase in the public sale at a price of $0.025 per token. The Coinbase token sales platform accommodates a minimum bid size of $100 and a maximum bid size of $100,000 (subject to higher maximum thresholds for Coinbase One subscribers pursuant to the Coinbase token sale platform terms).

Following completion of the public sale, coincident with the launch of Monad Mainnet, MON tokens will be distributed to purchasers. If the public sale is undersubscribed, any unsold tokens will be reallocated to ecosystem development. If the total number of requested tokens is greater than the total available tokens, a distribution mechanism called “filling up from the bottom,” will create a broad distribution among sale participants and limit asset concentration among large purchasers. Additional details on MON tokenomics are available in the [MON Tokenomics Overview](https://www.monad.xyz/announcements/mon-tokenomics-overview).

*3. Best-in-Class Technology*

**Monad’s Mission**

On November 24th, the world will witness the culmination of several years of technological innovation and engineering when the Monad Public Mainnet launches along with its native network token, MON. Monad is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain engineered for speed without sacrificing security or decentralization, all while maintaining full compatibility with the existing Ethereum ecosystem.

From the beginning, the Monad team has always been focused on building tomorrow’s tech, today. The mission is to power a new world economy, suitable for a world that is increasingly online and onchain, through state of the art financial infrastructure.

Success requires disruption. The north star is to see the entire global population utilizing applications built on top of Monad. These applications are uniquely enabled and powered by Monad and have the potential to improve lives. An exceptionally performant blockchain that is also decentralized can unlock new app experiences and use cases while also substantially improving the experience of existing ones. However, increased performance without compromising decentralization is the ultimate unlock. It allows for a censorship-resistant blockchain that can withstand the test of time. Operating through intense geopolitical turmoil, banking the unbanked, and serving the needs of global citizens are ideals that have true staying power in an ever-evolving world.

Monad will execute on this vision through three overarching pillars:

1. Enabling the Best Experience for Developers
2. Global Reach and Impact
3. Best-in-Class Technology

**Enabling the Best Experience for Developers**

Monad’s success depends on a thriving ecosystem of applications and developers. This is only possible when Monad is the premier place to build and deploy applications. EVM compatibility already reduces the bulk of friction for developers, but initiatives like [Monad Madness](https://madness.monad.xyz/) and the [Monad Founder Residency](https://residency.monad.xyz/) connected founders with world-class investors to gain invaluable exposure and funding to jumpstart their businesses.

*November 5th, 2025*

# A Line in the Sand for Blockchain History

On *November 3, 2025*, Algorand quietly achieved something no blockchain had ever done before: it executed the *world’s first post-quantum transaction* on its mainnet.

No simulation, no sandbox. A real transaction, secured by ***Falcon-1024 signatures***, now lives immutably on the Algorand ledger, a transaction that even the world’s most advanced future quantum computer couldn’t break.

For context, this isn’t just a technical milestone. It’s a statement of intent, one that reshapes what blockchain security means in an era where quantum computing is no longer science fiction but an approaching inevitability.

*“This isn’t theory anymore,”* I added. *“Algorand has crossed the bridge. The rest of the industry is still building.”*

# Why Quantum Resistance Matters

To understand why this moment matters, you need to understand the risk. Nearly every blockchain today, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even most of the newer ones, relies on *RSA* or *elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)* to verify ownership and authenticate transactions. These systems work beautifully against classical computers.

But against a quantum computer? They crumble.

Since *Peter Shor’s algorithm* in ***1994*** proved that a sufficiently powerful quantum machine could factor large numbers or compute discrete logarithms instantly, cryptographers have known what’s coming. It’s not a matter of *if*, but *when*.

The danger isn’t just futuristic. There’s what security experts call the *“harvest now, decrypt later”* problem. Bad actors can collect encrypted blockchain data today, store it, and wait until quantum machines mature, then decrypt everything at once.

When that day comes, every wallet, signature, and identity built on today’s encryption could be compromised.

This is why Algorand’s step isn’t about bragging rights. It’s about survival and foresight.

# Falcon: The Cryptographic Shield of the Future

At the heart of this breakthrough is ***Falcon,*** a lattice-based signature algorithm co-developed by cryptographic heavyweights like *Craig Gentry, Chris Peikert*, and *Vinod Vaikuntanathan,* with contributions from Algorand’s own *Dr. Zhenfei Zhang*.

Falcon, which stands for *Fast Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU*, was selected by *NIST in 2022* as a global standard for post-quantum digital signatures.

It’s efficient, compact, and incredibly hard to break even for quantum computers.

Falcon comes in two main versions:

* ***Falcon-512***, offering AES-128-level security.
* ***Falcon-1024***, providing AES-192-level strength — what NIST calls *“Level 5,”* the highest security tier available.

Algorand uses Falcon-1024. It’s the same signature scheme that already protects Algorand’s *state proofs,*compact cryptographic snapshots that allow other blockchains to verify Algorand’s state without intermediaries.

The genius here lies in Falcon’s balance:

* Its signatures are larger (around 1,280 bytes) but extremely fast to verify (under 100 microseconds).
* Signing takes more computation, but verification, the part blockchains do millions of times per day, is lightning-quick.

That trade-off is perfect for Algorand, where every block involves thousands of signature checks per second.

# Engineering the Impossible

Implementing Falcon in production wasn’t as simple as swapping one signature scheme for another.

Falcon uses *floating-point arithmetic* and *Fast Fourier transforms,* techniques that demand incredible numerical precision. One rounding error, and security could fail.

The Algorand Foundation’s team tackled this with a deterministic, constant-time implementation, ensuring no randomness or timing leaks that attackers could exploit.

Their guiding principles were clear:

1. ***No disruption to consensus:*** verification had to remain deterministic.
2. ***Seamless integration:*** of quantum-secure accounts is needed to act like normal ones.
3. ***Developer accessibility:*** the system should be easy to use and experiment with.

To achieve that, Algorand built something elegant: embedding Falcon keys inside *Logic Signatures* smart contracts that control how an account’s funds can be spent.

These contracts verify Falcon signatures over transaction IDs. If the math checks out, the spend is authorized.

From the network’s perspective, it looks no different from a traditional account only it’s *quantum-secure*.

# Building the Tools for a Quantum Future

To make this accessible, Algorand released the ***Falcon Signatures CLI,*** a command-line toolkit that lets developers actually create, fund, and transact from post-quantum accounts on mainnet or testnet.

Developers can:

* Generate Falcon keypairs
* Derive Algorand addresses from them
* Fund those addresses
* Sign and submit Falcon-verified transactions

In other words, anyone can now mint, sign, and send quantum-resistant transactions.

That’s not just innovation, it’s democratization of security.

# What’s Protected — and What Isn’t (Yet)

Algorand’s post-quantum rollout secures individual accounts and the blockchain’s historical state. State proofs — those compact summaries used by other chains — are now fully quantum-resistant.

But the *consensus layer* still relies on *Ed25519* signatures and **V***erifiable Random Functions (VRFs)* for validator selection. These are classical cryptographic mechanisms that quantum computers could theoretically exploit.

So while quantum attackers couldn’t steal funds from Falcon-secured accounts, they might still disrupt block proposals or manipulate future consensus events.

That’s why Algorand’s approach is *incremental but deliberate*: start with user-level protection, gain experience, then move up the stack toward quantum-secure consensus.

It’s the practical path to secure what’s possible now and evolve systematically.

# Falcon’s Broader Impact

Falcon’s adoption by Algorand has implications far beyond a single blockchain.

Because it’s *NIST-standardized*, Falcon can act as a *universal language* for cross-chain communication in a *post-quantum world.*

Algorand’s *state proofs*, already powered by Falcon, could allow other chains to verify data trustlessly with the same cryptographic standard, no intermediaries needed.

That sets the stage for a *quantum-resistant multichain future* where interoperability and security coexist instead of colliding.

The open-source Falcon CLI also invites global collaboration developers, cryptographers, even universities can study and improve the system freely.

# The Human Side: Algorand’s 2025 Roadmap

While the Falcon achievement represents Algorand’s technical peak, its *2025 roadmap* reveals something just as profound: a shift toward simplicity, usability, and community control.

In an industry drowning in jargon and fractured ecosystems, Algorand’s message is refreshingly human. The roadmap centers around three core goals:

1. ***Return power to the community***
2. ***Make blockchain development frictionless***
3. ***Deliver a user experience that feels like Web2 — but runs on Web3 principles***

# Community Takes the Wheel

Algorand is handing the steering wheel to its users.

Through *Project King Safety*, the network plans to redesign its fee and incentive model to ensure long-term sustainability, ending the era of foundation-subsidized economics. A position paper is due in *Q4 2025*, outlining how fees, validator rewards, and network incentives will evolve.

Even more transformative is the *revival of its grant program* under a *new governance structure.*

A community-elected *xGov Council* will now decide which projects get funding — removing centralized gatekeeping and restoring grassroots governance.

The foundation has already *reduced its stake from 63% to 21%* through a new rewards model, and a *peer-to-peer gossip network* is replacing its centralized relay architecture.

Each of these steps pushes Algorand closer to becoming a *fully peer-to-peer, self-governed ecosystem,*something most blockchains only claim to be.

# Simplifying the Developer Experience

The next frontier is making blockchain development as easy as writing a mobile app.

In *early 2026*, Algorand will launch *AlgoKit 4.0,* a major upgrade that introduces composable smart contract libraries, key-value storage *(“Schema”)*, and native support for mainstream languages like ***Rust****,* ***Swift***, and ***Kotlin***.

Developers will even be able to use ***AI assistants***, powered by large language models, to help write and debug contracts, merging artificial intelligence and blockchain into a single development flow.

*“Algorand is building a bridge for developers who don’t want to learn ten new programming languages just to build on Web3.”*

For enterprises, *Intermezzo*, debuting in *Q3 2025*, will handle all the hard stuff: key management, blockchain integration, and compliance. Businesses will be able to launch blockchain-backed loyalty programs, digital assets, or identity systems with almost no technical friction.

And for users? That’s where *Rocca Wallet* comes in.

# Rocca Wallet: Web3 Without the Headache

If Falcon is the brain of Algorand’s evolution, *Rocca Walle***t** is its face.

Set for *preview in Q4 2025* and an *open-source release in 2026*, Rocca aims to eliminate one of the biggest pain points in the crypto complex: intimidating wallets.

It supports *passkey logins* (no seed phrases), *fee abstraction* (users don’t even see *“gas*”), and *decentralized identity* (no centralized logins or data leaks).

It’s also *white-label*, meaning DApps can brand and customize it so the blockchain experience can fade into the background, letting usability take center stage.

In short, Rocca makes Web3 feel like Web2 only safer, faster, and fully decentralized.

# Powering the Real World

Algorand’s 2025 vision also extends beyond the screen. It’s targeting real industries where blockchain can quietly improve everyday life:

1. ***Tokenized Financial Products*****:** Using the *ACTUS framework*, Algorand is building smart contract models for tokenized debt and equity, with a *Debt ASA MVP* expected by *Q4 2025*.
2. ***Agentic Commerce*****:** Supporting AI agents that can transact autonomously via ***X402*** and *A2A payments,* blurring the line between AI and DeFi.
3. ***Self-Sovereign Identity*****:** The Rocca Wallet will enable verifiable credentials — like *WorldChess’s Universal Chess Passport*, which lets players compete globally without centralized logins.
4. ***Data Integrity*****:** Strengthening blockchain’s role as a permanent, verifiable record for supply chains, enterprises, and beyond.

# Privacy, Scalability, and the Quantum Edge

Algorand isn’t just catching up — it’s leaping ahead.

Its upgraded ***AlgoPlonk*** zero-knowledge system will make privacy faster and more flexible, while exploration into *multiparty computation (MPC)* and *fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)* lays the groundwork for transactions that remain private even while being processed.

Meanwhile, *parallel execution* and *block pipelining* are set to supercharge scalability, allowing multiple transactions to run at once and cutting block confirmation times even further.

And in the background, Falcon remains the silent guardian expanding from state proofs to user accounts, making Algorand one of the *first truly quantum-resistant blockchains on Earth.*

# How Algorand Could Shield Bitcoin and Other Networks from Quantum Threats

If the crypto industry ever faced a unified existential risk, it would be the moment a quantum computer gains the power to crack traditional cryptography. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and thousands of other networks rely on elliptic-curve signatures that a large enough quantum machine could break in hours.

But what if a blockchain already designed for quantum resistance could act as a *guardian layer,* a protective framework capable of verifying and securing other chains until they upgrade?

That’s precisely where ***Algorand*** could step in.

Through its ***Falcon-based state proofs*** and advanced cross-chain verification capabilities, Algorand could become a ***quantum-safe validation hub*****,** a kind of digital shield for legacy blockchains. Its post-quantum signatures could authenticate wrapped or bridged assets, allowing *BTC, ETH, or other vulnerable coins* to operate within a *quantum-secure environment* without needing to overhaul their original codebases overnight.

Imagine Bitcoin wrapped inside Algorand’s lattice-secured ecosystem, its ownership and movement verified by Falcon signatures, insulated from quantum decryption threats. The original Bitcoin chain could continue as it is, but its value, liquidity, and transaction flow could be mirrored through Algorand’s *quantum-proof framework,* preserving the integrity of BTC without disrupting its core protocol.

*“If Algorand were allowed to serve as a security layer for Bitcoin,”* I noted, *“it could buy the entire crypto industry time, maybe years, even decades to transition safely into a post-quantum era.”*

This kind of hybrid interoperability could extend to *stablecoins, NFTs, DeFi protocols, and cross-border payment rails* as well. Since Algorand’s state proofs already support *trustless communication across chains*, Falcon could underpin a multi-network safety web, one where any blockchain, even those not quantum-ready, could plug into Algorand for verification and data integrity.

It’s a bold idea, but one rooted in reality. Algorand’s technology isn’t just future-proofing itself; it could very well be *future-proofing everyone else*, too.

# Staying True to Web3’s Promise

While other networks chase hype cycles, Algorand is quietly rebuilding Web3 around its original ideals:

* *Transparency*
* *Security*
* *Community-led governance*
* *Sustainability*

Its uptime is near-flawless. Its scalability remains unmatched. And now, its cryptography is preparing for a world that doesn’t even exist yet.

# A Glimpse at the Horizon

Algorand’s latest moves, both technical and philosophical, signal a maturation of blockchain as an industry.

Falcon’s integration shows that cutting-edge cryptography can coexist with usability.  
The 2025 roadmap proves that decentralization and human-centered design aren’t opposites; they’re the same path forward.

Together, they redefine what *“Web3 readiness”* really means.

It’s not about speculation. It’s about *security that lasts decades, governance that empowers real people*, and *tools that anyone can use without a manual.*

Algorand’s post-quantum transaction didn’t just future-proof a blockchain, it *future-proofed the idea of trust itself.*

# The Final Word

For all the industry talk about quantum threats, decentralized AI, and next-gen networks, only one blockchain has proven it’s ready for the next era: Algorand.

From *Falcon’s lattice-based cryptography* to the *Rocca Wallet’s human-friendly design*, the network is merging the unthinkable military-grade security with intuitive simplicity.

*“What Algorand did isn’t just technical brilliance, it’s vision,”* I concluded. *“They’re showing the world that security, decentralization, and user experience can finally coexist. It’s the evolution Web3 has been waiting for.”*

# A Note on the Road Ahead

Quantum computers are coming. AI is accelerating.  
But for once, blockchain isn’t lagging behind innovation; it’s leading it.

And at the front of that pack, with its post-quantum Falcon wings already spread, stands ***Algorand.*** *Don’t give up on the underdog yet! This blockchain could surprise everyone at the end.*

Because the future doesn’t wait, and Algorand has decided it won’t either.

And in the background, Falcon remains the silent guardian expanding from state proofs to user accounts, making Algorand one of the *first truly quantum-resistant blockchains on Earth.*

# How Algorand Could Shield Bitcoin and Other Networks from Quantum Threats

If the crypto industry ever faced a unified existential risk, it would be the moment a quantum computer gains the power to crack traditional cryptography. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and thousands of other networks rely on elliptic-curve signatures that a large enough quantum machine could break in hours.

But what if a blockchain already designed for quantum resistance could act as a *guardian layer,* a protective framework capable of verifying and securing other chains until they upgrade?

That’s precisely where ***Algorand*** could step in.

Through its ***Falcon-based state proofs*** and advanced cross-chain verification capabilities, Algorand could become a ***quantum-safe validation hub*****,** a kind of digital shield for legacy blockchains. Its post-quantum signatures could authenticate wrapped or bridged assets, allowing *BTC, ETH, or other vulnerable coins* to operate within a *quantum-secure environment* without needing to overhaul their original codebases overnight.

Imagine Bitcoin wrapped inside Algorand’s lattice-secured ecosystem, its ownership and movement verified by Falcon signatures, insulated from quantum decryption threats. The original Bitcoin chain could continue as it is, but its value, liquidity, and transaction flow could be mirrored through Algorand’s *quantum-proof framework,* preserving the integrity of BTC without disrupting its core protocol.

*“If Algorand were allowed to serve as a security layer for Bitcoin,”* I noted, *“it could buy the entire crypto industry time, maybe years, even decades to transition safely into a post-quantum era.”*

This kind of hybrid interoperability could extend to *stablecoins, NFTs, DeFi protocols, and cross-border payment rails* as well. Since Algorand’s state proofs already support *trustless communication across chains*, Falcon could underpin a multi-network safety web, one where any blockchain, even those not quantum-ready, could plug into Algorand for verification and data integrity.

It’s a bold idea, but one rooted in reality. Algorand’s technology isn’t just future-proofing itself; it could very well be *future-proofing everyone else*, too.

# Staying True to Web3’s Promise

While other networks chase hype cycles, Algorand is quietly rebuilding Web3 around its original ideals:

* *Transparency*
* *Security*
* *Community-led governance*
* *Sustainability*

Its uptime is near-flawless. Its scalability remains unmatched. And now, its cryptography is preparing for a world that doesn’t even exist yet.

# A Glimpse at the Horizon

Algorand’s latest moves, both technical and philosophical, signal a maturation of blockchain as an industry.

Falcon’s integration shows that cutting-edge cryptography can coexist with usability.  
The 2025 roadmap proves that decentralization and human-centered design aren’t opposites; they’re the same path forward.

Together, they redefine what *“Web3 readiness”* really means.

It’s not about speculation. It’s about *security that lasts decades, governance that empowers real people*, and *tools that anyone can use without a manual.*

Algorand’s post-quantum transaction didn’t just future-proof a blockchain, it *future-proofed the idea of trust itself.*

# The Final Word

For all the industry talk about quantum threats, decentralized AI, and next-gen networks, only one blockchain has proven it’s ready for the next era: Algorand.

From *Falcon’s lattice-based cryptography* to the *Rocca Wallet’s human-friendly design*, the network is merging the unthinkable military-grade security with intuitive simplicity.

*“What Algorand did isn’t just technical brilliance, it’s vision,”* I concluded. *“They’re showing the world that security, decentralization, and user experience can finally coexist. It’s the evolution Web3 has been waiting for.”*

# A Note on the Road Ahead

Quantum computers are coming. AI is accelerating.  
But for once, blockchain isn’t lagging behind innovation; it’s leading it.

And at the front of that pack, with its post-quantum Falcon wings already spread, stands ***Algorand.*** *Don’t give up on the underdog yet! This blockchain could surprise everyone at the end.*

Because the future doesn’t wait, and Algorand has decided it won’t either.

The system connects Ethereum’s mainnet and its L2s into a shared network where transactions and liquidity can move almost instantly while still settling back to Ethereum’s base layer.

Before Atlas, activity on rollups happened in isolation. Transfers between L2s required bridging, often taking hours or days. Atlas establishes ZK-verified communication between chains, removing those delays and giving Ethereum’s ecosystem near-instant internal synchronization.

Beyond throughput, Atlas also changes how capital moves onchain. Assets like ETH, USDC, or stETH can now remain on mainnet as live collateral while being used across connected chains. A trader on GRVT — the first exchange using Atlas — can post margin or settle trades backed directly by funds still held on Ethereum. Because of sub-second verification between L2s and roughly 10–15 minute L1 finality, positions can be updated and verified on Ethereum faster than any centralized exchange settlement.

Beyond GRVT, another project applies the same logic at a broader scale. Lighter’s Universal Cross Margin system extends the model, letting any Ethereum-based asset — including ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or lending positions — serve as trading collateral without leaving mainnet. The assets stay on Ethereum, continue to earn yield, and are referenced through zero-knowledge proofs on Lighter’s Layer 2.

Every operation, from order matching to liquidation, is verified cryptographically on Ethereum rather than through bridges or custodians. This turns Ethereum itself into the universal margin ledger while execution happens off-chain. The result is the same pattern seen with GRVT and Atlas: higher-performance layers forming around Ethereum without detaching from its security or liquidity base.

Across Layer 2 chains, we're seeing the first prototypes of cross-asset margining operating in real time. This promises a world where liquidity that was previously locked in silos can be used simultaneously on multiple venues. Each transaction updates instantly across the network, with Ethereum providing the final source of truth.

The effect is that the Ethereum ecosystem begins to operate less like it a collection of fragmented chains, and more like a single network of connected execution layers — each specialized, but all secured by the same base. Instead of competing L2s, Atlas and Lighter make them part of one market bus.

In parallel, EigenCloud demonstrates the same consolidation on the compute side. It turns Web2 backends into verifiable smart-contract services secured by Ethereum. It reduces the cost of launching decentralized applications by using ETH as the universal security bond and keeping familiar Web2 interfaces like email login or off-chain computation.

Together, these developments show Ethereum scaling by integration rather than duplication — bringing verifiable applications and high-throughput trading into a single security domain, with ETH as the settlement asset that connects them all.

This is a Proof of Work blockchain that runs on the XHash algorithm being ASIC resistant for now, not allowing ASICs to overflow the initial hashrate. 

Parallax has a fixed supply of 21 million tokens and a 10 minute block time just like Bitcoin but it is a EVM compatible blockchain meaning that it can be highly progamable like Ethereum. It's important to note that there was no premine and the main developer didn't take any allocation of the first issued tokens to himself, allowing miners to distribute all the rewards.

LAX preserves the cypherpunk Ethos aiming to be highly decentralized and community driven. It also allows to combine Bitcoin's fixed rules for money with Ethereum progammable environment.

Being full EVM compatible allows users to add the wallet straight to Metamask using the following instructions to create a custom network in Metamask.

Network name: Parallax

RPC: https://rpc.parallaxchain.org

Chain ID: 2110

Symbol: LAX

Explorer: https://explorer.parallaxchain.org

After adding this to Metamask, users all fully able to send, receive and sign transactions in Metamask.

Although it's in its infancy, LAX has already gather the attention of many small exchanges and has a respectfull volume right now, the price is about 0.5$ per LAX at the time of writing and the hashrate has been constantly rising in the last few days. Listing in Safe Trade is already confirmed and should be done in a few days, being a much larger exchange it should attract a lot more volume to LAX.

Parallax is different from the usual launch of coins because of its fair launch and deserves being named just because of its fairness in a world populated with VCs and premined cryptocurrencies.

Even as Bitcoin kept hitting new all-time highs, most altcoins kept bleeding.

People say that money moves from Bitcoin → Ethereum → large caps → small caps → microcaps. But here's the rub: that pattern only really works when interest rates are low and the Fed is doing QE. It DOES NOT apply when interest rates are 4-5% and the Fed is doing QT.

**The 2021 setup: 0-0.25% rates + QE**

In 2021, interest rates were basically zero. Inflation was around 2-3%, so holding cash felt like slowly losing money. So everyone - regular folks and institutions alike - wanted higher returns.

They put money into anything that earned more than 2%. A lot of this money flowed into crypto through DeFi. This pushed up the TVL of nearly every goddamn protocol. It was an era of easy money, so even stupid NFTs could sell for a million bucks.

**The turning point: October 2021 CPI report**

Before the October CPI report, the Federal Reserve kept saying inflation was transitory. On 10 November 2021, we saw a CPI reading of 6.2%. At that point, it was clear inflation wasn't going away. The Fed had to do a full 180 and HIKE BABY HIKE.

That October CPI report was the exact moment that triggered the 2022 market crash, because it signalled the Fed had to pivot.

**The 2022-2025 cycle**

In this cycle, inflation has been hovering around 2-3%, but interest rates have been 4-5%. You can get that sweet-ass 4-5% just by putting money in a high-yield savings account. That means people can earn 1-3% above inflation by doing nothing. There's very little reason for anyone to put money into DeFi.

With low DeFi TVL and no hype, Ethereum-like chains that depend on DeFi basically all died. This is why your altcoin died.

**Altcoins that did work in 2022-2025**

Some examples:

SOL: \~$9 → $200+

RAY: \~$0.15 → \~$7.50

PENDLE: \~$0.05 → \~$7

INJECTIVE: \~$1.30 → $40+

ROLLBIT: \~$0.002 → $0.20+

**What do all these have in common? Leverage.**

RAY lets you buy SOL memecoins that can 10x-100x fast. You need SOL for gas. PENDLE lets you make big gains when DeFi interest rates move from 2% to 4%. HELIX on INJECTIVE gives you up to 50x leverage on crypto futures. ROLLBIT is a crypto casino that also offers leveraged crypto futures.

People still want chances to double their money or more in a year. They do not care about 5-8% returns. Protocols that turn greed into revenue do fantastic, but everything else fails.

**If you want to do well next cycle;**

With low DeFi TVL and no hype, Ethereum-like chains that depend on DeFi basically all died. This is why your altcoin died.

**Altcoins that did work in 2022-2025**

Some examples:

SOL: \~$9 → $200+

RAY: \~$0.15 → \~$7.50

PENDLE: \~$0.05 → \~$7

INJECTIVE: \~$1.30 → $40+

ROLLBIT: \~$0.002 → $0.20+

**What do all these have in common? Leverage.**

RAY lets you buy SOL memecoins that can 10x-100x fast. You need SOL for gas. PENDLE lets you make big gains when DeFi interest rates move from 2% to 4%. HELIX on INJECTIVE gives you up to 50x leverage on crypto futures. ROLLBIT is a crypto casino that also offers leveraged crypto futures.

People still want chances to double their money or more in a year. They do not care about 5-8% returns. Protocols that turn greed into revenue do fantastic, but everything else fails.

**If you want to do well next cycle;**

Either stick to Bitcoin, **OR** focus on protocols that offer some form of leverage.",negative,0.9888260364532471

For me, there are a few use cases (I'm disregarding illicit ones) for cryptocurrencies in general:

1. Investing into them long-term. Holding some part of your wealth in Bitcoin or whatever you think is best for that. You don't plan on selling any of it for 10 years+. You may or may not have the extra conviction to have full control over your assets.
2. Investing into them, but on a shorter timeframe. You want to hold some of your wealth there, but eventually, you might want to withdraw some, but not all the time.
3. Holding some of it and borrowing against it to pay daily bills.
4. Using it for paying for stuff on the internet. It's kind of an edge case right now, but it does happen.
5. Transferring money between countries with no common or dysfunctional banking systems.
6. Trading, either on centralized exchanges or on decentralized exchanges.

Point 3 isn't really possible with self-custody anyway, your assets are collateral, that means it will be in some custodial wallet. This is out for a hardware wallet.

Point 4 you want convenience. Connecting a hardware wallet every time you make a transaction is annoying, and you'll probably not hold a significant portion of your wealth in such a wallet. For a small wallet for active transactions, a hot wallet (custodial or self-custodial) seems most reasonable, no point in a hardware wallet.

Point 5 is similar to the former point. You're holding the money for a short time, a hardware wallet would be more of an inconvenience and you don't gain much from it. But I can see how it can feel cool for some, I don't see the point in it.

Point 6, a hardware wallet makes little sense. Tradinc on a centralized exchange is custodial anyway, and decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid, you can use with a hardware wallet, but this isn't the place for long-term investments, so the size argument probably is key here again. I don't see the big benefit there.

Point 1, a hardware wallet makes no sense to me. You don't need a hardware wallet to put money into it. You're not withdrawing for years anyway, and you need to backup your key whatever you do (which is not trivial). If self-custody is important to you and you don't trust banks, a paper wallet - multiple backups, in multiple places, safely stored, ideally not recognizable as keys to a wallet - makes much more sense than a hardware wallet. If you have a hardware wallet lying around in your house it telegraphs to anyone finding it that you have it, and they might coerce access from you. Since you're not withdrawing anyway, you don't need the convenience they give of actually accessing the wallet. And if in the future, in many years, you REALLY want to withdraw, then you can still import it into a hardware wallet.

Point 2, to me, is the only one where a hardware wallet could conceivably make sense. But for that case, the non-long-term part of your holdings, which you hold for months or a couple years, just choosing the convenience of an ETF seems so much better in any way. You don't have the responsibility to secure them (that's your broker's responsibility), you don't have any risk of losing it, and you can sell anytime, if you need the money. If you don't trust banks, you can split your holdings in the long-term part (see Point 1), and just hold parts of it in an ETF, which also diversifies the ways you might lose access to your assets (if the bank blocks you from it, you still have the fallback of the self-custodial part, and if you happen to lose all your backups, you can always recover your broker...).

If self-custody is not important to you, ETFs are the way to go for both points 1 and 2, anyway.

Long story short, my question: do you have any tangible use cases where a hardware wallet would be necessary or beneficial (in contrast to a paper wallet, which does make sense in some cases)?

1. Investing into them long-term. Holding some part of your wealth in Bitcoin or whatever you think is best for that. You don't plan on selling any of it for 10 years+. You may or may not have the extra conviction to have full control over your assets.
2. Investing into them, but on a shorter timeframe. You want to hold some of your wealth there, but eventually, you might want to withdraw some, but not all the time.
3. Holding some of it and borrowing against it to pay daily bills.
4. Using it for paying for stuff on the internet. It's kind of an edge case right now, but it does happen.
5. Transferring money between countries with no common or dysfunctional banking systems.
6. Trading, either on centralized exchanges or on decentralized exchanges.

Point 3 isn't really possible with self-custody anyway, your assets are collateral, that means it will be in some custodial wallet. This is out for a hardware wallet.

Point 4 you want convenience. Connecting a hardware wallet every time you make a transaction is annoying, and you'll probably not hold a significant portion of your wealth in such a wallet. For a small wallet for active transactions, a hot wallet (custodial or self-custodial) seems most reasonable, no point in a hardware wallet.

Point 5 is similar to the former point. You're holding the money for a short time, a hardware wallet would be more of an inconvenience and you don't gain much from it. But I can see how it can feel cool for some, I don't see the point in it.

Point 6, a hardware wallet makes little sense. Tradinc on a centralized exchange is custodial anyway, and decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid, you can use with a hardware wallet, but this isn't the place for long-term investments, so the size argument probably is key here again. I don't see the big benefit there.

Point 1, a hardware wallet makes no sense to me. You don't need a hardware wallet to put money into it. You're not withdrawing for years anyway, and you need to backup your key whatever you do (which is not trivial). If self-custody is important to you and you don't trust banks, a paper wallet - multiple backups, in multiple places, safely stored, ideally not recognizable as keys to a wallet - makes much more sense than a hardware wallet. If you have a hardware wallet lying around in your house it telegraphs to anyone finding it that you have it, and they might coerce access from you. Since you're not withdrawing anyway, you don't need the convenience they give of actually accessing the wallet. And if in the future, in many years, you REALLY want to withdraw, then you can still import it into a hardware wallet.

Point 2, to me, is the only one where a hardware wallet could conceivably make sense. But for that case, the non-long-term part of your holdings, which you hold for months or a couple years, just choosing the convenience of an ETF seems so much better in any way. You don't have the responsibility to secure them (that's your broker's responsibility), you don't have any risk of losing it, and you can sell anytime, if you need the money. If you don't trust banks, you can split your holdings in the long-term part (see Point 1), and just hold parts of it in an ETF, which also diversifies the ways you might lose access to your assets (if the bank blocks you from it, you still have the fallback of the self-custodial part, and if you happen to lose all your backups, you can always recover your broker...).

If self-custody is not important to you, ETFs are the way to go for both points 1 and 2, anyway.

Long story short, my question: do you have any tangible use cases where a hardware wallet would be necessary or beneficial (in contrast to a paper wallet, which does make sense in some cases)?

I remember how hard it was to find quality content about crypto back then, when most of the material was still about earning free bitcoin faucets and anarcho-capitalists talking about bitcoin’s future.

There were only a few exchanges and most didn’t even require KYC. Altcoins were this hazy thing, you had to download the wallet to your PC and often the whole blockchain just to store your little coins. It was fun and innovative.

Ethereum started to take off in 2017 and smart contracts began pulling crypto out of the prehistoric era. An ICO here, another one there, tokens were being listed on exchanges with ridiculous pumps, suddenly everyone wanted a piece of the pie and ICOs started crawling out of the gutter.

Masternodes, PoS coins, smart contracts, hard forks with miners and idealists still trying to be the lords of bitcoin. Bitcoin was still viewed with huge distrust by small investors, but that didn’t stop it from making the most memorable rally, going from 600 dollars in September 2016 to almost 20k in December 2017. It felt like the revolution of the century.

Then came the long winter in 2018. Bitcoin dropped more than 80 percent, but it was a pretty normal bear-market correction, maybe boosted by the frenzy of greedy and failed ICOs.

It took until the covid crash for the market to heat up again. The amount of money injected into the economy was insane. For a brief moment it felt like there were fewer projects than there was demand. It started with DeFi, the rise of DEXes, governance tokens and generous airdrops. For me that was the best moment in crypto, between 2020 and 2021. But as 2021 went on, the exuberance went way overboard. Crypto went mainstream with celebrities, meme coins, blockchain games, NFTs costing almost as much as a yacht, and ponzi schemes like Luna and FTX popping up and somehow reaching absurd valuations.

In 2022 reality hit hard and crypto collapsed like never before. Losses and bankruptcies were everywhere. BTC fell below its 2017 peak again and a lot of inexperienced investors who got caught in the hype the year before were wiped out. Even stablecoins were under extreme distrust. I remember coworkers asking for help with Metamask and buying NFTs, that was the ultimate bubble signal. These people will never come back to crypto, and who could blame them? Even experienced investors lost fortunes.

Then 2024 arrived and thanks to the first bitcoin spot ETF prices went up quickly, even before the halving cycle. It was the bitcoin dominance cycle. Only a few selected altcoins went up and those crazy altseasons were left behind. Even with a pro-crypto president the market didn’t heat up, the mood of distrust and resentment was still there. Any sign of buying or innovation that used to look like a game changer and a promising opportunity started to be seen as a scam. Controversial listings on big exchanges, insiders dumping, tokens that seemed created only to benefit a tiny group of sharks with no real value. There are way more tokens than the current cautious and selective demand can handle, barely any liquidity. I think even serious projects got hit by this paranoia and never took off.

My view is that crypto lost a big part of the ideology that made it interesting. For you to download an entire blockchain and store your little coins, someone had to really believe in that thing. There was an idea behind it, something that didn’t involve venture-capital money, shady insider allocations, or quick profits from futures trading. Crypto turned into pure speculation. Everything is easy now. A project appears and it’s already listed for derivatives trading, and people don’t care about anything else. They just see it drop 50 percent in a week and nobody wants it anymore. The promise of more liquidity came at a high price, with clueless investors and vultures who robbed and keep robbing the space.

Crypto turned into just trading, empty and random, nothing behind it, fast gains and goodbye. At least with stocks you can see some backing, results, profits, a business to evaluate.

AI stocks are tied to products you actually use daily. Health-care stocks influence what you pay at the pharmacy. Defense stocks shape where a big chunk of taxpayer money goes.

Crypto is just money speculating on itself. There’s no substantial innovation anymore, nobody gets excited about using a smart contract or downloading a new wallet and appreciating a protocol’s tech. I still have my Monero wallet here in the old-school way, but one of the few coins that actually fulfills a real use case ends up banned from exchanges, and that says a lot.

More than 8% of Bitcoins entire supply changed hands over the past seven days. Joe Burnett from Semler Scientific called this one of the most significant onchain events in Bitcoin history.

The last times we saw supply movements this large were in March 2020 when BTC was around 5000 dollars and December 2018 when it hit 3500. Both of those marked local bottoms before accumulation phases that eventually led to new all time highs. So historically this type of activity has been bullish longterm.

Theres a catch tho. Up to half of this movement might just be from Coinbase doing a wallet migration they announced on Saturday. So the actual selling and buying pressure might be less dramatic than the raw numbers suggest.

Right now the markets completely focused on what the Fed does on December 10th. Odds of a 25 basis point rate cut jumped from 50% to 82% in just a week according to CME Groups FedWatch tool. Thats whats fueling Bitcoins recovery from 81k back to 87k.

More than 8% of Bitcoins entire supply changed hands over the past seven days. Joe Burnett from Semler Scientific called this one of the most significant onchain events in Bitcoin history.

The last times we saw supply movements this large were in March 2020 when BTC was around 5000 dollars and December 2018 when it hit 3500. Both of those marked local bottoms before accumulation phases that eventually led to new all time highs. So historically this type of activity has been bullish longterm.

Theres a catch tho. Up to half of this movement might just be from Coinbase doing a wallet migration they announced on Saturday. So the actual selling and buying pressure might be less dramatic than the raw numbers suggest.

Right now the markets completely focused on what the Fed does on December 10th. Odds of a 25 basis point rate cut jumped from 50% to 82% in just a week according to CME Groups FedWatch tool. Thats whats fueling Bitcoins recovery from 81k back to 87k.

This was confirmed by many core devs including Gavin Andresen among others: [March 2013 Chain Fork Post-Mortem](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki)

**Background**

In 2013, there was a [catastrophic bug in the 0.8 Bitcoin release](https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2015/07/28/analyzing-the-2013-bitcoin-fork-centralized-decision-making-saved-the-day/) that caused a **hard fork** between Bitcoin Core 0.7 and 0.8. Later on, 0.8.1 was released to patch the bug, but before that happened, Bitcoin mining pools **51% attacked** the network to revert the canonical chain back to 0.7, leading to a massive **24-block, 5-hour reorg**. At the time, this was the 2nd largest reorg of Bitcoin (the largest being the 53-block reorg in 2010 for the 184B minting bug).

About 60% of mining power had already switched to 0.8, so it was the canonical chain.

**51% attack and 24-block reorg**

Afterwards, a few Bitcoin mining pools decided to support the 0.7 fork, and Bitcoin mining pools BTCGuild and Slush (among others) 51% attacked the network. Many members of the community and merchants were not given sufficient time to respond.

**Double-spend attack**

Unfortunately, by the time of the reorg, [OKPAY accepted a $10K deposit from a user at block 225446](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=152348.0) of the 0.8 chain. This allowed a UTXO from the orphaned 0.8 chain to be rebroadcast to the mempool and reused, leading to the first known cryptocurrency double-spend.

The Potential (Why It Could Be the Real Deal):

 * 10,000 TPS via Parallel Execution: Monad is the first EVM-compatible chain to implement optimistic parallel execution. This allows it to process transactions simultaneously, a fundamental breakthrough over the sequential execution model of Ethereum.
 * Full EVM Compatibility: Existing Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) can be ported directly without code changes, providing an instant gateway to existing DeFi and developer communities.
 * Significant Backing: Raised over $400 million from top-tier VCs (like Paradigm), indicating strong belief in its long-term infrastructure vision.

The Concern (The Red Flag):

 * Small Public Allocation: Only 7.5% of the total supply is designated for the public sale. This is a very low percentage, leading to concerns about centralization and a market heavily reliant on a small circulating supply.
 * Vesting Schedules: While the large allocations to the team and VCs are locked up until mid-2026 and later, the high projected Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) suggests that all future success is already priced in.

As you probably know by know, this coming December 3 is an important date for Ethereum holders and team, Fusaka upgrade is coming to mainnet on that day.

This upgrade is a game changer and will improve the ecosystem a lot making it very usable and better for the long term. Ethereum basically hit the gym, cutting weight and becoming faster and smoother, all of this without sacrificing security. This is a quality of life buff for users, devs and business.

As you can see in the tweet and in the image above these are the things that Fusaka brings to the table:

* **30–60% cheaper transfers** \- sending ETH or tokens is more affordable.
* **3–5x faster-feeling transactions** \- not instant but close to a no wait just send vibe.
* **NFT minting costs drop 60–70%** \-huge for creators, platforms and anyone making drops.
* **More stability for businesses** \- Less spikes, smother execution and almost no downtime.
* **Developers save 25–35% on gas** \- This will help devs to build more and have less things to cry about xD

The final result? A better user experience for everyone, from degen traders to Web3 startups or just for people who only touch Ethereum when they mint an NFT.

This is also cool because Fusaka boosts the whole modular ecosystem without trying to replace rollups or rewrite Ethereum's roadmap.

December 3, dont forget that date, it will probably dont affect price in the short term but it will in the long term.

Are you hyped for Fusaka?

That peak-to-trough move of roughly one third has been described by BeinCrypto as the steepest pullback of this bull cycle so far, and you can feel the uncertainty in the way people are trading.

Some on-chain and technical analysts are arguing that, despite how nasty this correction has been, the broader uptrend from the past year and a half is still intact. They’re basically framing this as a classic bull market pullback – ugly in the short term, but still within the kind of drawdowns we saw in previous cycles before new highs.

The other camp is more cautious. Bitcoin has run straight into resistance in this low-90k area and stalled. If buyers can’t step in soon and turn this into a clean higher low, there’s a real chance we end up retesting the recent lows down in the low-80k region – and a decisive break below 80k is exactly the kind of level some analysts have warned could accelerate selling.

A lot of traders are starting to treat this as a potential range rather than a straight trend. The idea is something like: resistance up around the low-90s, support down near the prior lows, and opportunities only at the extremes – fade euphoria near the top of the range and bid fear near the bottom – until the macro picture or flows force a real breakout.

The problem is that short term players are going to get wrecked whichever way it eventually breaks. If price squeezes above the current resistance, anyone who’s been shorting every lower high gets steamrolled. If we lose those low-80s supports, all the “buy every dip” crowd gets dragged into a much deeper drawdown than they signed up for.

Right now it feels like a waiting game. Macro data and the next Fed decision are hanging over everything, liquidity is thinner than it was near the top, and volatility is sleeping just enough to make people overconfident.

Right now ETH is trading around 3034 dollars but his composite fair value shows about 4777 which means its roughly 58 percent undervalued according to his weighted analysis.

The thing is the models give wildly different results. Some are super bullish like the Metcalfes Law model valuing ETH at around 9586 which would be about a 216 percent gain from here. The staking rewards DCF model puts it at roughly 9102 and both of these are in the “aggressive upside” camp, with the Metcalfe model specifically tagged as high reliability on the dashboard.

But then you got other models saying ETH is actually overvalued. The price to earnings ratio model values it at only about 957 making it roughly 68 percent overvalued. The revenue yield model says around 1532 so about 49 percent overvalued. And these income style models also get high reliability scores.

So how does he get to “58 percent undervalued”? He weights the models differently. High reliability models get multiplied by 9, medium by 5 and low by 2. Since those aggressive DCF and Metcalfe style models are weighted heavily they pull the composite value way up even though a couple of conservative models are pointing down.

Kim was pretty honest about it saying the crypto industry deserves better than pure price speculation and that the models are far from perfect and open to feedback. At least hes transparent about the assumptions and reliability tags instead of just throwing out a single target price with no context.

The purchasing power of my parents has fallen off a cliff, they are wealthy on paper because they have housing, but the cost of everything from energy, food, water is astronomical, they just don’t have housing to worry about unlike the rest of us.

Once Gen X and the boomer generations have offloaded their only assets for the equity (housing) they need to survive we will be entering a new age of neo feudalism where this “wealth” is extracted and transferred to the capitalist owning class and everything is rented back to us.

So far this month, Bitcoin is down roughly 17–20%, trading around the $90–92k range. That’s pretty close to the losses from November 2019, when BTC dropped about 17–18%. The worst November on record was back in 2018, with a brutal ~36% crash in the middle of that bear market.

Historically, November has actually been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, with average returns around 40% in past cycles, so this kind of red November is a big break from the usual pattern. One major structural change this time around is that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs finally launched in January 2024, which pulled a lot of institutional money directly into BTC and may have shifted the timing of the typical post-halving “euphoria” phase.

Since those ETFs went live, institutions and large funds have played a much bigger role in price action, and a lot of analysts think that’s changed the rhythm of this cycle. Instead of the classic script where October and November often rip higher, this year October already closed slightly red and November is now deeply negative despite that historically bullish seasonality.

Another huge factor has been leverage getting nuked. A ton of traders were running oversized long positions with borrowed money, and when the October and November sell-offs hit, billions of dollars in longs were force-liquidated. That cascade of liquidations amplified the downside and helped drive BTC from an all-time high around $126k in October down into the low $80ks at the worst point of this drawdown.

Some analysts actually see this “flush” as a necessary cleansing process. It shakes out over-leveraged players and weak hands, kills off some of the froth, and can set up a healthier base for the next leg up once the market digests all the forced selling.

One interesting pattern from the last decade: every time Bitcoin has had a red November, December has also finished red. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but if that pattern holds and you combine it with the usual post-halving correction, it wouldn’t be shocking if real recovery takes time and stretches well into 2026 rather than bouncing straight back in the next few weeks",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p9ebti/how_bitcoin_turned_its_strongest_month_into_its/,hodorrny,39.0,26.0,0.71,1764386502.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"How Bitcoin turned its “strongest month” into its worst in 7 years...

One major structural change this time around is that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs finally launched in January 2024, which pulled a lot of institutional money directly into BTC and may have shifted the timing of the typical post-halving “euphoria” phase.

Since those ETFs went live, institutions and large funds have played a much bigger role in price action, and a lot of analysts think that’s changed the rhythm of this cycle. Instead of the classic script where October and November often rip higher, this year October already closed slightly red and November is now deeply negative despite that historically bullish seasonality.

Another huge factor has been leverage getting nuked. A ton of traders were running oversized long positions with borrowed money, and when the October and November sell-offs hit, billions of dollars in longs were force-liquidated. That cascade of liquidations amplified the downside and helped drive BTC from an all-time high around $126k in October down into the low $80ks at the worst point of this drawdown.

Some analysts actually see this “flush” as a necessary cleansing process. It shakes out over-leveraged players and weak hands, kills off some of the froth, and can set up a healthier base for the next leg up once the market digests all the forced selling.

One interesting pattern from the last decade: every time Bitcoin has had a red November, December has also finished red. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but if that pattern holds and you combine it with the usual post-halving correction, it wouldn’t be shocking if real recovery takes time and stretches well into 2026 rather than bouncing straight back in the next few weeks",positive,0.9827877879142761

That’s not pocket change, that’s serious conviction that Bitcoin is heading up.

What makes this interesting is the timing. Bitcoin is sitting around the low $90k range right now and has been pretty volatile lately. This trader is basically betting big that we’re going to see higher prices soon. The position uses leverage too, which means the gains could be huge but so could the losses if things go south.

The market has definitely been heating up. Daily BTC trading volume is in the high tens of billions of dollars right now, so there’s clearly a lot of activity and interest. Between whales, derivatives and bigger players still taking directional bets, there’s plenty of fuel for more volatility in both directions.

These kinds of whale moves usually create ripple effects. Other traders see this and it ends up influencing their decisions – sometimes it brings in more buyers, sometimes it just adds even more chaos to the price action.

Personally I think it’s wild to see someone throw that much money on a leveraged bet. One wrong move and that’s a massive liquidation. But clearly some people are still comfortable taking huge swings at these levels.

They’re available to the average Joe - you don’t need to be a member of congress or have a nyc real-estate dad who bankrupted himself six times.

# 1. Nothing Ever Happens - Fade the Chaos

Most geopolitical headlines create emotional spikes, but 90% of them resolve into nothing. When YES jumps 10-20% on hype, pros immediately buy NO because fundamentals never changed.

# 2. Copy Trading Profitable Whales

Some wallets have stable, long term alpha from arbitrage, data feeds, or structured models. Instead of competing, track them and mirror only their strongest convictions with 1-2% allocation. You can discover manually on pm -> more -> leaderboard or use 3rd party tools. I’ll post the video in the comments where I go into more detail about these strategies and how to find and track insiders.

# 3. News Scalping

Prediction markets aren't as fast as crypto or equities. HFT isn't as popular. When major news breaks: ceasefires, scandals, Fed leaks - the first 30 sec decide the trade. You buy immediately with momentum, then unload into the slower retail crowd minutes later.

# 4. Personality-Driven Mention Trading

These are a separate category called “mention markets,” common in political speeches and corp earnings calls.  
Speakers have predictable behavior patterns - Trump rambles and repeats, while others stick to teleprompters and avoid going off-script. You bet YES when the speaker is a talker; you bet NO when they’re scripted.

Will Trump mention “rigged elections,” “worst president,” “horrible,” “tremendous”?  
These markets show up almost daily because Donnie from Queens loves to yap. Buy around $0.80 when the market opens, sell around $0.90 when the cameras start rolling.

# 5. Fed Signal Trading

The Fed telegraphs everything before it happens. Following Powell, Waller, Williams, Jefferson, and Timiraos lets you front-run interest rate odds before markets reprice.  
Compare with CME fed watch tool.

# 6. Positive EV Grinding

Some outcomes are 90-95% likely, but retail misprices them at 70-80% because they chase underdog fantasies. Everyone wants that 10x but its very rare in prediction markets. Pros buy the obvious outcome and let it drift back to fair value.

# 7. Break Media Narratives. Trade Reality

Western media often misreports or pushes narratives. Using local language sources, Telegram channels, and verified battlefield or political data gives you earlier and more accurate probabilities than the global crowd.

# 8. ""Girlfriend Poll"" Alpha

Pop culture markets (Taylor Swift albums, influencer drama) are mispriced by male traders. Polling women who follow this world daily gives a surprisingly accurate read.

# 9. Mentions Markets - Default to NO

YES is structurally overpriced in short-duration “mention” markets. Unless the speaker is historically chatty or the narrative strongly fits, NO is almost always the correct baseline.  
Even though Trump is a yapper, but he doesn't mention ""crypto"" often. But everyone in crypto believes believes he does.

# 10. Main-Character Rotation

Politics is attention-driven. Identify who is about to become the “main character” of the news cycle and buy early when they are still cheap.  
For example, everyone assumes Newsom is the next Democratic nominee - but there are still 2 full years before the 2028 election. Plenty of time for him to do something off-putting that could tank his chances.

# 11. Riskless Rate Discounting

""Will US admits aliens exist?"" trades at 2-3%. Why?  
Multi-year markets have a built-in time-value distortion: NO-capital gets locked, holders sell early, and YES briefly becomes overpriced. That 2-3% is ""riskless rate"" and is present in every long duration market. You use that “aliens/Jesus” benchmark to adjust probabilities and place staggered NO orders.

# 12. Fake News Pattern Recognition

Prediction markets get flooded with fake filings, edited screenshots, and fabricated scandals - and retail traders jump instantly. Professionals track patterns from past hoaxes, so when a new “breaking update” appears, they check if it follows the same script. If the source looks sketchy or recycled, they fade the spike. The edge comes from spotting gullibility faster than the crowd.

# 13. Partial Resolution Advocacy

Some markets don’t fail on the event - they fail on the wording. Ambiguous terms like “suit,” “invade,” or “announce” trigger rule fights, leading to partial payouts. If you buy early at 20–40 cents anticipating confusion, you can profit even when the outcome isn’t clean. You’re not predicting reality, you’re predicting how the committee interprets vague language.

# 14. Cultural Calendar Alpha

Governments avoid embarrassing news or risky actions close to major cultural holidays, yet markets still price dramatic moves during these periods. When traders expect something big near a national or pride-heavy date, fading the hype gives you edge. Most people ignore cultural patterns, even though they strongly shape political behavior. It’s not geopolitics - it’s timing psychology.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1payslv/14_polymarket_trading_strategies/,ZhenyaV,30.0,9.0,0.89,1764550357.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"14 Polymarket trading strategies.

No bulls are buying. Supposedly JP put another hit piece out on MSTR and that's the supposed reason for the selloff...

  
But it's really not. This could have been seen coming a million miles away, honestly. All these hit pieces. And chances are MSTR will probably fail and force sell some Bitcoin dumping prices further. If they have not already due to the MCSI 55% rule.

  
So that leads to this - why is this so goshdarn predictable? 

  
I've only been swinging it for about 5 years now. But it's easy to see the phases. The best advice is you HAVE to pay attention to vibes on social media, but ALWAYS DO THE OPPOSITE.

  
The halving cycle in many ways predicts if not outright causes the news cycle. Last time around, Bitcoin's natural decay after the peak FOMO part of the pattern in many ways lead to and caused FTX, but FTX was a byproduct. It could have been easily predicted. Every halving cycle, several exchanges or entities involved in Bitcoin go bankrupt because they don't have the liquidity and/or are so zealious and overconfident that they had the liquidity but then overleveraged. Similar to how MSTR is probably right now. They got too --- cocky.

  
Last cycle, Cathy Woods and CNBC and various other media sources right near the final top in the FOMO pattern were calling for 50% returns from that point. That was a clear sign of - exuberance. At the bottom, nobody wanted it, because they thought it would go to $0. And not just Peter Schiff. A ton of reputable sources thought Bitcoin was failing and done when it hit $19k post-FTX.

  
So enter this year. I shorted at 118k, in my Roth IRA via BITI. I then doubled down around 105k via SBIT. That's working out for me pretty well right now. 

  
Cyclically speaking, the FUD follows due to - not just your average Joe - but the big entities folding. You can blame JP Morgan for this all you want, but in the end maybe they are sort of helping to move the halving cycle along, but the halving cycle was already set in motion well before JP Morgan started talking FUD on Microstrategy. It really doesn't matter what Microstrategy does at this point - it's just that part of the cycle. Bitcoin is going to continue falling until people stop saying ""It's going to 105k. It's going to $1 million. Q4 will be epic. Blah blah blah blah blah blah....""

  
Don't fight the FUD. Embrace it until it turns into true, undeniable fear. Then buy it.

  
The only thing that could break the halving cycle is if Trump starts buying Bitcoin and establishing a strategic reserve. Maybe. But I'm not sure that's as bullish as people think - if Trump ends up controlling the Federal Reserve with his agenda and establishes the Bitcoin Reserve - it could actually be quite bearish and may actually cause this to be Bitcoin's Proof of Steak moment to where the next halving cycle high is lower than the current cycle because people are realizing the whole project lost it's mission.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pay5d0/why_is_the_crypto_market_as_a_whole_just_so_darn/,f00dl3,0.0,24.0,0.35,1764548625.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Why is the crypto market as a whole just so darn predictable?

The spooky part is it looks a lot like 2021. Back then the same wallet range cooled off on accumulation and a few months later we slid into a proper bear market. Not saying copy paste crash incoming but it’s one of those signals you don’t just ignore.

Hard forks are common for blockchains. Most newer and modern blockchains use a mix of soft and hard forks for updates. Older blockchains often soft fork to maintain backwards compatibility with old and insecure client versions.

By definition, a hard fork is an update or event that will result in a chain split if block producers and node clients continue using different versions.

####**Soft Forks result in code bloat, dangerous practices, and technical debt**:

Soft forks maintain backwards compatibility with older clients, so they need to add additional code logic to detect and deal with all the different types of clients they might encounter. This creates developer complexity and code bloat by continuously supporting archaic and dangerous practices.

**Imagine what would happen without hard-forks**:

* Newer WiFi routers would still support the insecure WEP or WPA protocol
* Browser would still support old, insecure versions of SSL
* Newer computers would still support Windows 3.0 (launched 1990) natively
* Windows 11 would still support early 1990s Intel 386-generation hardware.
* All city roads would still allow for horses and wagons.
* All US stores would still accept 3-cent, 5-cent and 10-cent paper notes; and half-cent, 2-cent, and 3-cent, and large cents; and $100,000 bills.
* Doctors would still support dangerous practices such as bloodletting, mercury prescriptions, arsenic prescriptions, and trepanning (drilling holes into skulls)

It's dangerous to never hard fork.

####**Bitcoin soft forks results in complexity and update delays**

Bitcoin still supports many outdated legacy addresses such as P2PK, P2MS, P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKSH, P2WSH. Each of these has their own special quirks, and every Bitcoin client needs to add additional complexity to support them. Many of these aren't quantum secure and should be prevented from transferring in the future, which requires a hard fork.

Bitcoin nodes also take forever to update to a new version. It wasn't until mid-2024 that most clients supported transferring to Bech32m addresses that were introduced in May 2021. Taproot, which requires Bech32m support, also took nearly half a decade to obtain significant client support. That's because unlike with hard forks, Bitcoin nodes aren't required to support the latest features. So it takes the Bitcoin network half a decade to pick up new features.

####**Bitcoin has hard-forked at least twice, and that's perfectly fine**

Lastly, contrary to popular opinion, Bitcoin's canonical chain has actually hard forked at least twice unintentionally.

1. There was a temporary 0.8 update related to the 2013 reorg (where a 51% attack and double-spend also occurred). Had the update been planned as a hard fork instead of soft fork, there wouldn't have been a disastrous chain split.
2. The 0.3.6 OP_NOP update also resulted in a hard fork a year later when the first OP_NOPX transaction was submitted in block 163685.

Pre-0.3.6 Bitcoin clients no longer sync with newer versions due to a hard fork, and that's not a bad thing. No one should be running archaic versions of Bitcoin client.

Jameson Lopp discovered that 7 out of 21 known Bitcoin consensus updates were of the hard fork type and not the soft fork type. They could've been triggered by a ""poisoned"" transaction like in the November 2025 Cardano chain split, but no one ever submitted one for 5 of them.

We often talk about TPS, but Block Time is arguably just as important for the ""feel"" of a blockchain. It dictates the heartbeat of the network and how responsive dApps feel to the end user.

Interesting takeaways ↓

The Sub-Second Club: It's getting crowded. Aptos is leading the pack with an insane 0.08s, followed closely by Somnia (0.1s) and Sui (0.24s).

L2s vs. High-Performance L1s: It's interesting to see Arbitrum (0.25s) sitting right up there with the parallelized L1s like Sui and Solana.

Solana: Sitting at 0.4s, which is standard for them, but technically slower than the top 5 in this specific metric.

The 2-Second Standard: Chains like Base, Optimism, and Polygon are consistent at 2s. While reliable, the gap between 0.08s and 2s is becoming noticeable in high-frequency trading or gaming use cases.

Does block time matter to you as a user, or do you only care about finality and fees? At what point does ""fast"" become ""fast enough"", can you actually feel the difference between 0.1s and 0.4s?
