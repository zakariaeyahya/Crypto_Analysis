Even after submitting everything, several people say their funds were never released. Some users claim they tracked their coins on-chain and saw them moved to other exchanges like HitBTC while Changelly insisted the funds were still “under review.” Others noticed the terms of service quietly changing, or the support team asking for new documents each time one set was completed. Common red flags mentioned by users: \- Transactions “on hold” without clear reason or timeline \- Constantly changing KYC demands \- Lack of transparency about fund status \- Funds traced to external exchanges \- Support giving vague or repetitive replies \- TOS updates after disputes begin It might not be an outright scam, but it definitely feels like a system built to stall or trap users with larger amounts.

This allows the security token’s logic (compliance rules, jurisdictional requirements, governance modules, etc.) to evolve without redeploying the token contract. Why this matters: * **Regulatory flexibility** – facets can be upgraded to meet changing legal requirements. * **Stability** – the token address stays the same, aiding audits and investor trust. * **Reusability** – the platform can support multiple offerings using shared contract modules.

p_1ocfok4,"Question on how Bhutan national ID on Ethereum works When the user signs something with their national ID, does the party they verify against receive the full ID signed by the government (such that it can be leaked), and does these credentials (that conform to ""W3C standard"" right) include a ""decentralized identifier"", and on Ethereum there is a lookup table somewhere with Bhutan ""decentralized identifiers"" to public keys, such that the party being verified against can verify that the person was the owner of the credentials? In other words, can the credentials trivially be leaked, as there is no ""trapdoor"" or such (as this requires the government key being the one that authenticates, and if user authenticates that part has to be sacrificed but the benefit is the government is no longer notified each time ID is used)? **Edit:** According to Claude AI it seems BBS+ is what solves this problem, and lets the signed credentials still be proven only relative the party verified against, such that they cannot leak the credentials. **Edit:** It now seems the Bhutan ID does not have that property, and that it would require ""designated verifier signatures"". Anyone who is an expert on how Bhutan national ID works or the standard it is based on (W3C?) feel free to explain. **Update:** It seems the Bhutan national ID is not private as proofs can be leaked (and in cybersecurity they should be considered public, anything that can leak will leak). Whereas designated verified signatures, an older and probably simpler system, seems to provide true privacy. I assumed ""state of the art"" national ID on Ethereum would do so, but seems it does not. I am *not an expert* on these things, and I am trying to understand best I can as I am interested in seeing advances in digital ID. Steinfeld, R., Bull, L., Wang, H., Pieprzyk, J. (2003).

p_1odcd4y,"Gitcoin Grants 24 is testing zk-based voting (MACI + Privote) — and I’m in the Privacy Round! Hey everyone 👋🏾 I wanted to share something exciting — my youtube channel “90 Seconds to Crypto” was accepted into the Privacy Round of Gitcoin Grants 24! For anyone unfamiliar, Gitcoin is a public goods funding protocol built on Ethereum. It’s where open-source builders, researchers, educators, and creators can receive community funding through mechanisms like quadratic funding — where 100 people donating $1 matters more than 1 person donating $100. What makes this round special is that the Privacy Round is using MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) and Privote, a private, zk-proof-based voting system that ensures every vote is tamper-proof, private, and verifiable — making this round a real experiment in testing zk-based voting that could one day power even bigger digital democracies. My channel focuses on values-driven, principles-led crypto education — shining light on projects building real-world utility and privacy tech (think Railgun, Fileverse, Fluidkey, etc). If that resonates, you can support my work through Gitcoin here: [ Every donation, even $1, helps massively thanks to quadratic funding — and all proceeds go directly to keeping the channel going and spreading the good word on good work in crypto. I also made a video breaking all this down — from Gitcoin’s funding model to how MACI works: 🎥 [ Would love any thoughts or feedback from the community — especially from those experimenting with zk tech, onchain governance, or past Gitcoin rounds.

Today, they dropped a game-changing proposal (SIMD-0266) to overhaul the SPL Token Program with a hyper-efficient replacement called p-token. Authored by 0x\_febo, this upgrade could slash token operation costs by up to 98%, freeing up nearly 12% of block space for more transactions. That's right—Solana's already blazing-fast network just got a turbo boost on paper. Why This Matters: More Txns, Less FrictionRight now, about 10% of Solana's block compute units are gobbled up by token instructions alone. With p-token, those costs drop dramatically, directly pumping up the chain's effective throughput. Imagine running complex DeFi flows—swaps, transfers, mints—without hitting CU walls as often. This isn't just a tweak; it's a direct capacity unlock that plays nice with other upgrades like 100M CU blocks and higher account limits. The Tech Breakdown: Efficiency Without the HeadacheP-token is a full reimplementation of the SPL Token Program, but don't worry—it's 100% backward compatible. No code changes needed for clients or dApps; it's a drop-in replacement. Here's what makes it tick: * No heap allocations: Ditches memory overhead for leaner ops. * Zero-copy data access: Reads data straight from accounts without unnecessary copying. * New killer instructions: * Batch: Bundle multiple token ops into one cross-program invocation (CPI). * UnwrapLamports: Skip creating temp native accounts for lamport handling. Check out this chart from Anza showing the CU smackdown across common instructions (P-Token in green vs. SPL in purple): |Instruction|SPL Token CUs|P-Token CUs|% Savings| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |TransferChecked|6,200|105|98%| |Transfer|4,645|76|98%| |CloseAccount|4,240|120|97%| |InitializeAccount3|2,916|248|92%| |InitializeImmutableOwner|3,045|1,404|54%| |SyncNative|381|38|90%| |InitializeAccount|4,527|154|97%| Neodyme's audit replayed mainnet transactions and confirmed p-token spits out identical results to the current SPL program.

Institutional capital is funding its altcoin bets by selling BTC ETPs.

p_1odpw3s,"How To Make Solana Great Again? # How to Make Solana Great Again? This article aims to establish a targeted developmental strategy – the ""SOL Focus Strategy"" – under the grand narrative of ICM, covering areas from tokenomic model optimization to secondary ecological development. The north star goal of this strategy is to enhance SOL's value capture capability, thereby incentivizing ecological growth and aligning with the grand narrative of ICM. # 1. Tokenomic Model Adjustment Solana's current excessively high inflation rate has hindered ecological development, which is precisely why SIMD0228 was proposed. Therefore, adjusting Solana's inflation rate is imperative. But what should the specific adjusted rate be? We can first define several soft conditions to determine the final inflation rate and staking rewards: ① A 2% terminal inflation rate is appropriate. The U.S. Federal Reserve also endorses this standard: in 2020, it explicitly incorporated the ""Average Inflation Targeting"" framework into its policy system. While it allows short-term inflation to slightly exceed 2% to offset periods of below-target inflation, it maintains 2% as the long-term core anchor, believing this level is most conducive to sustaining stable tokenomic growth. This logic equally applies to the long-term stable development of the Solana ecosystem. ② SOL should avoid deflation. While SOL deflation may seem to drive price appreciation, we must recognize that Solana, as a high-performance blockchain infrastructure, should derive its value growth primarily from its own ecological development and performance improvements – not deflation. SOL deflation would reduce holders' willingness to deploy SOL in ecological use cases (such as staking, DeFi, and NFT transactions), which would suppress ecological vitality and innovation. Thus, deflation for SOL is undesirable. ③ SOL's staking yield should exceed the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds. RWA (Real-World Assets) is a current hot trend and will be a key development direction in the future. It also serves as a critical narrative pillar aligned with the ICM strategy, as it will bring massive liquidity to the entire crypto industry and introduce products with real-world risk-free rates of return (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds). Consequently, the Solana ecosystem will inevitably integrate RWA products related to U.S. Treasury bonds. SOL's staking yield represents the native risk-free rate of return within the Solana ecosystem, and it will inevitably compete with RWA products. Given that U.S. Treasury bonds carry lower risk than Solana staking, SOL's staking yield must exceed that of U.S. Treasury bonds to remain competitive. Since the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds is approximately 4%, SOL's staking yield should ideally surpass this level. ④ Should SOL earmark a portion of inflationary funds for long-term development? (This requires further consideration.) Would it enhance the attractiveness of the Solana ecosystem if a fixed percentage of the annual inflation rate were set aside as a dedicated treasury, with funds targeted allocated to long-term ecological development and reserved for contingency use? For details on how this treasury should be utilized, please refer to Section 3 below. # Conclusion: Based on the above soft conditions and Solana's foundational context, we can design an initial inflation rate of 3% for SOL: * 0.5% of this rate will be permanently directed to a treasury, ensuring a stable revenue stream for ecological development. * The remaining 2.5% will be used to reward staking participants. Currently, Solana's staking ratio stands at 65% – a relatively high level. After the inflation adjustment, some stakers will be incentivized to unstake and redeploy SOL into the ecosystem to pursue higher returns. If the staking ratio stabilizes at 50%, validators can expect an approximate 5% yield, slightly exceeding the yield of U.S. Treasury bonds. This will maintain the healthy operation and attractiveness of the ecosystem. # 2. Stablecoin Strategy Solana needs a SOL-collateralized stablecoin. # Rationale: At present, the relationship between many public chains and their ecosystems exhibits a zero-sum dynamic. For example, projects like [Pump.Fun]( require SOL as the participation asset for their business model, allowing them to accumulate large amounts of SOL. However, when these projects realize profits, they often sell off SOL to strengthen their own operations – which restricts SOL's inherent growth. Secondly, SOL's price volatility directly impacts the development of many projects within the Solana ecosystem. The prosperity of the ecosystem is highly correlated with SOL's price, which contradicts real-world pricing mechanisms. In traditional public companies, business operations (fiat-settled supply and demand systems) and stock markets (equity value systems) are inherently isolated: entity operations determine stock performance, but stock price fluctuations do not directly affect daily operations. For instance, even amid a stock market crisis, Luckin Coffee was able to maintain revenue growth through proactive business operations. However, the single-token system in the crypto world breaks this isolation: a single token simultaneously serves as the primary medium for the network's commercial scenarios (e.g., gas fees, entry tickets for application participation) and as an investment asset in the capital market. This creates a risky ""double helix effect"": when the token price rises, market sentiment fuels false ecological prosperity; when the price plummets, developers' incomes decline sharply, leading to difficulties in project operation and maintenance. This is analogous to a project facing operational disruptions solely due to a sharp drop in its token price – a scenario that defies common sense yet is prevalent in the current crypto market. Therefore, ensuring that project operations are driven by supply-demand dynamics (rather than capital market fluctuations) is a critical challenge for Solana and the broader crypto market. Replacing the tokens used in commercial scenarios with stablecoins could address both issues mentioned above: * If Solana's ecological applications widely adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins, cashing out these stablecoins would significantly reduce selling pressure on SOL. * Meanwhile, SOL's price would no longer disrupt normal business operations, avoiding the double helix effect. Once a large number of applications adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins for commercial use, a drop in SOL's price will not severely impact their operations. In turn, the stable operation of these ecological projects will provide support for the prices of both SOL and their own tokens. This strategy will also lock up significant amounts of SOL within such stablecoin applications and spawn derivative applications similar to Curve. Additionally, large-scale stablecoin adoption can integrate with the payment ecosystem: an officially launched Solana Payment App could first support SOL-collateralized stablecoins, followed by USDT/USDC and other mainstream stablecoins. Furthermore, the ICM strategy includes not only pure financial applications but also scenarios where traditional businesses are implemented via Web3. Such projects typically use stablecoins or fiat currencies (e.g., USD) for transactions. If Solana officially launches a SOL-collateralized stablecoin and establishes a dedicated entity to handle off-chain USD-to-on-chain stablecoin exchanges, it will attract more traditional businesses to Web3-ize their operations on Solana – further enriching the ecosystem. Most importantly, this stablecoin need not rely solely on SOL as collateral; it can also accept additional assets (e.g., ICM-related assets) as collateral. This would provide a use case for the large capital pools in ICM, enhance the stablecoin's utility by generating additional interest, and attract more users to adopt or hold it – accelerating the development of Solana's stablecoin ecosystem. # 3. Sustainable Development of SOL In the real world, a common economic stimulus method involves: 1. Collecting tax revenue into a treasury; 2. Distributing a portion of the treasury as consumption vouchers to encourage spending; 3. Generating new tax revenue through the commercial activities driven by this spending. This creates a cycle that enables targeted stimulation of desired sectors while ensuring sustainable tokenomic development. The same logic applies to public chains. Many public chains achieve cold start by launching incentive programs, collaborating with applications to attract users. Early users can earn both public chain rewards and application-specific incentives – a win-win scenario. However, many public chains lack sustainable incentive plans and token value capture mechanisms, leading to insufficient funds for long-term ecological incentives and hindering their long-term growth. Thus, Solana's development requires a long-term incentive mechanism to achieve sustainability – which is why Section 1 proposes earmarking a portion of inflationary funds for a treasury. # Specific Uses of the Treasury: The treasury's 0.5% share of the inflation rate will be allocated to five key areas (the exact percentage for each area can be further deliberated, but establishing such a treasury is essential for providing sustained, direction-driven support to Solana): ① Regular incentives (e.g., quarterly) for users of applications with high TVL and transaction frequency. This is a long-term, permanent incentive direction aimed at increasing long-term SOL lock-up and driving more transaction-based burns – ultimately enhancing SOL's value capture from the ecosystem. ② Periodic incentives for specific sectors: For example, one quarter may prioritize incentives for AI application projects, while the next quarter may focus on high-potential sectors like RWA. This mirrors government-specific funds, which provide targeted support for key industries. ③ Targeted support for projects adopting SOL-collateralized stablecoins: Airdrops will be provided to users of projects with higher stablecoin adoption rates. ④ Targeted support for ICM-aligned projects: Funding will be directed to projects that align with the ICM strategy. ⑤ Development regulatory reserves: These funds will be locked in the treasury long-term and only deployed when the staking ratio is insufficient. Their purpose is to incentivize more participants to stake, ensuring Solana's network security. # Fine-Tuning the Burn Mechanism Currently, Solana's burn mechanism operates as follows: * 50% of base fees are burned, and 50% are distributed to validators; * 100% of priority fees are distributed to validators. This mechanism only burns approximately 0.3% of SOL's total supply, making it impossible to achieve the ideal 2% terminal inflation rate. Priority fees can be viewed as excess returns generated by Solana's network prosperity – and these returns should be aligned with SOL's value. This alignment would tightly bind network prosperity to SOL's value capture. For these reasons, we propose revising the priority fee distribution to (The specific ratio can be further discussed.): * 70% to validators, * 20% burned, * 10% reverted to the treasury. This adjustment will enable the treasury to benefit from ecological growth, creating a positive ""recovery-expenditure-recovery"" cycle. It will also enhance SOL's value capture from the ecosystem and, when combined with the treasury's regular incentives, accelerate burns and value capture – ultimately helping achieve the 2% terminal inflation rate target. # 4. The Necessity and Strategic Significance of Solana's Official Applications The launch of official applications by public chains will become an inevitable trend, driven by three key factors: # ① Public chains need to control core applications Core applications play a crucial role in empowering the public chain's token and ensuring ecological stability. If core applications encounter issues, they can disrupt the development of other ecological projects. Thus, managing these applications in-house (by the public chain team) is optimal. For example, Aerodrome – the DEX on Base – was co-launched by the Base team and Velodrome, an established DeFi team. Revenue from Aerodrome can be reinvested to support the Base team's operations. Even if Aerodrome faces issues, the public chain team can provide backup support. In contrast, third-party teams may struggle to recover from hacks or even execute rug pulls – resulting in significant ecological losses. Examples of such core applications include DEXs, over-collateralized stablecoin projects, and Curve-like protocols. These are all suitable for Solana to develop as official, native applications. # ② Public chains need to ensure core applications empower the native token (which is $SOL, not third-party tokens) Ecological applications on public chains employ diverse business models and tokenomic mechanisms. Some accumulate large amounts of the public chain's token and lock in profits by selling it (e.g., Pump.Fun), creating selling pressure on SOL. If Solana officially launches an application with the same functionality as [Pump.Fun]( it can accumulate large amounts of SOL and manage it in ways that minimize ecological impact. For instance: * The revenue could be reinvested into over-collateralized stablecoin protocols to generate stablecoins, with profits used for ecological development; * Users could be required to use SOL-collateralized stablecoins to participate in the application. Such designs would not only reduce negative ecological impacts but also increase demand for SOL and accelerate its value capture. A relevant case is Virtuals Protocol, which mandates that users use Virtual tokens to participate in its token launches. Additionally, newly issued tokens must form trading pairs with Virtual tokens to be traded. While this design partially stems from Base's lack of a native token, similar models are gaining traction on public chains with native tokens. Traditionally, new tokens would form trading pairs with the public chain's native token – a standard practice. However, designs like Virtuals' have led many projects to mandate trading pairs with their own tokens instead. This means value that would have been captured by the public chain's token is now siphoned off by third-party application tokens. To counter this trend, public chain projects must directly compete for ecological empowerment. # ③ Competitive pressure from other public chains An increasing number of ""public chain infrastructure + official applications"" combinations are emerging. The competitive edge derived solely from blockchain technology or ecological empowerment is diminishing; many projects are seeking ways to secure sustained external capital support for their blockchains – with exchange empowerment being the most effective and direct method. Some projects originated as applications and later expanded into public chains to develop their ecosystems. For example, HyperLiquid first launched a permissioned chain-based on-chain contract application, then built an EVM chain to grow its ecosystem – following a ""trading + public chain ecosystem"" logic. This model is being adopted widely: for instance, payment giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm are jointly incubating Tempo, a new blockchain project built specifically for stablecoin payments, which will likely follow a ""payment + public chain ecosystem"" logic. Additionally, Base Chain and BNBChain are typical examples of ""exchange giant + public chain ecosystem"" combinations, both leveraging CEXs to empower their public chains. These models share a common trait: public chains are no longer satisfied with growth driven solely by on-chain applications. Instead, they are integrating off-chain cash flow-generating businesses with their ecosystems – importing additional positive external resources. In the past, Solana's ecosystem was empowered by the FTX exchange, but no such external positive resources currently exist to continuously inject vitality into Solana. Collaborating with another exchange could lead to uncontrollable risks (like the FTX incident). Thus, Solana must build its own positive external empowerment. # Specific Actions Required: Solana needs to build a permissioned chain to host an official on-chain exchange (including spot and futures trading – a long-term goal). The rationale for developing this in-house (rather than assembling third-party projects) is that third-party projects cannot be built around SOL's value capture – they issue their own tokens and design business models to empower those tokens instead. Solana must expand its value capture from ""infrastructure only"" to ""infrastructure + official application suite."" Revenue generated by official applications should be continuously reinvested into Solana's development, creating efficient synergy. A permissioned chain is necessary (rather than building directly on Solana's mainnet) because only permissioned chains can deliver performance and user experience comparable to CEXs – a key advantage of HyperLiquid. Furthermore, HyperLiquid's growing success demonstrates that on-chain contract and spot trading will be a key growth market in the future. This market will not be dominated by a single player; new competitors will inevitably emerge. Solana should enter this space early to compete. Solana's mainnet already hosts substantial capital, users, and projects – an official Solana-based HyperLiquid equivalent could reactivate the ecosystem, similar to how Coinbase empowers Base and Binance empowers BNBChain. Solana needs cash flow-generating applications to provide sustained external positive support for SOL – and it can even develop features that outperform HyperLiquid. For example, traditional institutions' core concerns about entering ICM are ""compliance and security""; an official permissioned chain exchange could address these concerns through ""regulatory alignment + custody guarantees,"" serving as an ""institutional gateway"" to ICM. This permissioned chain could be co-developed with Solana Layer2 Stack projects (e.g., HyperGrid or Other Layer 2 infrastructure teams, such as Altlayer), or built independently by Solana via its own Layer2 Stack. Developing a Layer2 Stack is critical for the broader ICM narrative, as traditional enterprises and investors typically enter on-chain tokenomic development through two paths: 1. Building applications directly on a public chain; 2. Launching their own managed and controlled Layer2s, then building application ecosystems on these Layer2s. The latter path is preferred not only for faster speeds and lower fees but also for ""sovereignty"": enterprises can directly control the Layer2's development and avoid disruptions from other Layer1 applications (e.g., Layer1 performance degradation or short-term gas fee surges caused by a popular application). Additionally, Layer2s enable the development of broader application ecosystems (not just single applications) and capture value from these applications. This explains why Robinhood plans to launch a Layer2 and Stripe is developing a Layer1 – sovereign application chains will be a potential future trend, and Solana's Layer2 Stack can fully enable this narrative. Moreover, Solana's Layer2 can support both SVM and EVM, with potential liquidity interoperability between the two. This will attract projects that require EVM-compatibility but demand lower fees and higher performance – potentially making the migration of Ethereum ecosystems to Solana a new trend. (Solana's growth potential should revolve around the SOL token and its overall network, not exclusively around SVM.) With an official Layer2 Stack, more application scenarios can be migrated to Layer2: for example, a dedicated chain for Solana's DePIN projects or a specialized chain for payment scenarios – reducing the mainnet's load. Expanding further, Solana could also develop an official bridge to connect these Layer2s; the revenue from this bridge could be reinvested to enhance SOL's value. However, it is important to note that Layer2 may reduce value capture from fees in the short term. Thus, the highest priority in the early stages should be completing the official permissioned chain (via Layer2 Stack) to launch a Solana-based HyperLiquid equivalent. # Summary These strategies are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. They will: * Introduce new types of applications to enrich Solana's ecosystem; * Provide diverse value capture mechanisms for SOL, ensuring it correctly captures value from the ecosystem; * Lay a solid foundation for the effective implementation of the ICM strategy (ICM requires a low-inflation environment to encourage the development of new ICM-aligned applications, and a stable ecosystem will attract more traditional capital to participate in Solana); * Prepare Solana for future competition, as an increasing number of chains are leveraging exchanges (CEX/DEX/PERP) for empowerment. Note: The strategic insights presented in this article reflect the author's current views. If given the opportunity to communicate in depth and gain a better understanding of Solana's future plans, the author is capable of developing more aligned strategies, facilitating their implementation, and validating the author's vision for Web3 development. # AfterWord Recently, the BNBChain ecosystem has seen a surge in momentum, and ecosystem activity has experienced a resurgence. While many may view this recent upswing of BNB as merely a short-lived boom, the actual situation is that the industry will develop along two paths: 1. The first path involves the continuous emergence of new hot topics that drive market sentiment, leading to numerous pump-and-dump activities. However, this path will undoubtedly present opportunities for substantial gains, attracting capital, users, and development teams to explore more efficient products and tools around it. 2. The second path focuses on more fundamental inherent needs that better drive industry development, such as directions like RWA (Real-World Assets), AI (Artificial Intelligence), and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks). For public chains, DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges), and CEXs (Centralized Exchanges), the optimal approach is to actively embrace both paths. Therefore, Solana can, to a certain extent, draw lessons from BNBChain’s experience in the first path while exploring the second path based on its own unique advantages. This article represents some reflections on the second path. Of course, the strategy mentioned in this article is only the first step; once this first step is truly taken, there will be a second-phase strategy. I hope to have the opportunity to share more about it in the future. # Answers to Some Questions **Q: Is this approach too centralized?** A: For a public chain, technology can be decentralized, but operationally, a central guiding force is needed to steer its development. Otherwise, it may well be eliminated in the fierce competition. Therefore, a certain degree of centralized operation is acceptable. **Q: Regarding the revised data mentioned in the article, are there more appropriate data points available?** A: The data is definitely not final and requires further discussion, but the overall operational logic is relatively certain. The development pattern of the industry will most likely make public chains, DEXs, and CEXs competitors to one another. Hence, it is necessary to make preparations and plans early. **Q: The article mentions many applications, such as stablecoin protocols, for which there are already existing projects. Why is there still a need for the official team to develop one?** A: SOL-based stablecoin protocols will be among the most important DeFi financial infrastructures and are closely tied to SOL. They need to be overseen by the official team. Because if it were a third-party protocol, the development of that protocol would be aimed at its own growth and would not prioritize the impact on SOL. In contrast, if developed by the official team, the economic flows within it can drive capital repurchases and redistribution for SOL.",2025-10-23 01:59:40,Glittering-Parsley38,post,solana,,Reddit,0.26970983,0.019619212,0.71067095,positive

You are right. It isn’t. Treat it so. “Do Your Own Research” (DYOR) is not a fad but an important element of the cryptoverse. Do keep that in mind. # Crypto Futures | Warning, Warning! You already read the warning above and understand that this is not financial advice at all. In fact, this goes beyond warning, and I request you not try it if you haven’t ever tried the Futures market. For your information, I lost USD 20,000 before I even understood how Futures work. Then I lost another USD 1,200 (in INR) on CoinDCX (Indian Crypto Exchange) before I got an idea of how to get it right in Futures. So, I urge you not to try this if you have no clue what the Futures market is all about. Now that the warning is out of the way, let’s dive straight in. # To The Futures Players | And the Stalwarts | And the Veterans So, I keep playing in the Futures market on CoinDCX, and I have some investments on GateIO. I trade on GateIO and play Futures on CoinDCX. In both cases, BTC is common. Here is something interesting I observed: 1. The price of BTC on GateIO is 50-100 dollars higher than on CoinDCX. I presume this is due to the Exchange’s formulae of averaging the price of BTC on the major exchanges. 2. Whatever the case, at any given point in time, the difference is at least 50 USD. 3. And when the price is fast-moving, the difference goes up to 100 USD. I am yet to witness a bigger difference than this. So, safely assume it is between USD 50 and 100. 4. Now, the regular trader may think of arbitrage, but I don’t think arbitrage will work that fast, or maybe it will with bots. I don’t know, and it is not something I am interested in. You can still check it out. But there is something more, and that is the fun part. 5. If you are a Futures player who plays scalping or day trading, then you are always asking the question of which direction the price is moving. 6. However, if you are both on CoinDCX and GateIO, then you can look at the price on GateIO, and whatever the price is, you know the price on CoinDCX is going to be 50 to 100 USD less. 7. You can look at the direction of trade (increasing or decreasing) and go and buy a Long or Short contract on CoinDCX. 8. I recommend trying with small amounts first until you get the hang of it. Once you get the hang, buy Long or Short and close the contract when you achieve 10, 20, or even 50% profit on your position. 9. It is working like a charm for me, and I am loving it completely. That’s it. That’s the trick. # Words of Caution | Be Smart About the Trick This will not work if you see an extremely fast movement of the Bitcoin price upwards or downwards. Why? Because by the time you buy the contract (Long or Short), the price could have reversed, leading to losses. I have tried this with Bitcoin, but it should work with any coin/token. I recommend not taking a chance with other tokens if you have no idea of their price movements. Bitcoin is easy. Others may not be. That’s it.

p_1oe43xd,"Payments 101: Why Polygon is built for money, crypto payments, and onchain finance At Polygon, we have a clear vision: to make Polygon the leading global payments and settlement infrastructure in crypto. tl;dr: * The best money rails are onchain, on Polygon * Stable, near-instant, and low-cost, Polygon is the infrastructure payment service providers need to thrive * Polygon is so easy to build on that many consumers that use popular apps like Polymarket don’t even know they’re on Polygon * The network is scaling to meet surging demand Your money today is stuck in line at the bank. Sending it across borders means paying high fees and waiting days for settlement—plus the feeling that you have to rely on a string of intermediaries who profit off your hard work. Now imagine the process without banks, without delays, without enormous fees. That’s the promise of onchain payments—and Polygon is delivering. Send and receive money as easily as a DM. For the past fifteen years, blockchains have promised peer‑to‑peer finance. But only recently, with a series of payments-focused upgrades for Polygon, has infrastructure matured enough to make real‑time payments feel like the internet. Stablecoin volumes on Polygon in Q3 hit all time highs, at $3.4B, and volume was up to 287M, a 21% quarter over quarter increase. Institutions and startups alike are betting big on crypto and integrating on Polygon, including Stripe, Revolut, Nexo, Reliance Jio, and BlindPay. And then there’s Polymarket, the first real breakout crypto app. Built and grown on Polygon, Polymarket alone has seen nearly $20B in predictions volume, is the official prediction market for X, and just raised $2B in funding. All of this indicates something true: there is real momentum for onchain payments and digitally-native money more broadly. This trend has people wondering: Why payments, why now, and what’s next? # Why payments? Traditional payment rails weren’t built for a digital, global economy. Legacy systems batch transactions, rely on closed ledgers, and charge fees that seem invisible until you need to send money across borders. Worse, settlement can take days, meaning funds remain “in transit” and tied up in capital‑inefficient float. For individuals sending remittances or merchants trying to manage cash flow, these frictions are a barrier to true global scale. Onchain payments on Polygon solve this. Stablecoins like USDC and USDT0 represent one‑for‑one claims on fiat currency and settle on instantly and irreversibly. When you pay someone on Polygon, the transaction finalizes in seconds and costs fractions of a penny. There are no intermediary banks and no cut‑off times. * **For businesses**, this means lower operational costs, better margins, immediate liquidity, and programmable financial flows. **‍** * **For consumers**, it means owning your money and moving it freely. Polygon’s ecosystem has grown into one of the largest stablecoin hubs because it combines high throughput with low fees. Recent upgrades bring the network new dimensions of speed, lightness, and reliability—everything you need in a chain focused on payments and programmable money. With this foundation, payments on Polygon feel less like a cassette player and more like a streaming platform. # Why now? As Polygon scaled Ethereum, it became a natural gateway for onchain financial activity. From payments to predictions, Polygon cemented itself as the money rails bringing the next era of digital-native finance. And core developers leaned in. Bringing the world global payments means a network that is: * Light * Fast * Low-cost, and * Easy to build on Every upgrade to Polygon in the last year is a step to doubling down on these qualities longterm so that as demand scales, so does the infrastructure to meet it. The Rio upgrade transforms Polygon into a faster, lighter, and more resilient network built for payments at scale. With a new block production model, Polygon can now reach up to 5,000 transactions per second, delivering near-instant finality and eliminating the risk of reorgs entirely. Validators benefit from stateless validation, which makes running lightweight nodes easier and lowers the barrier to entry for securing the network. As payments integrations across Polygon continue to grow, Rio only accelerates the trend—pushing the network closer to its vision of real-time, global money movement. Every upgrade is important to meet surging adoption. The network supports major institutional integrations from Stripe, Polymarket, Reliance Jio, BlindPay, and many others. \\ For builders and users, the combination of high throughput, low fees, gasless UX and five‑second finality means there’s never been a better time to build on or use Polygon for payments. # What's next? Polygon’s ambition doesn’t stop at 5k TPS and near-instant finality. Polygon’s gigagas roadmap lays out a vision to scale to 100k TPS. Achieving that scale requires rethinking block production and validation, which is why the recent Rio Payments upgrade is such a pivotal moment. Rio introduced a Validator‑Elected Block Producer (VEBloP) model and stateless block validation. Together, these changes boost throughput, eliminate reorgs, and make finality near‑instant. In other words, Rio makes Polygon faster, lighter and more reliable. Not in some distant future, but right now. Looking ahead, the combination of Rio, more seamless interop, and the broader gigagas roadmap paves the way for programmable money and real‑world asset (RWA) tokenization at global scale. With instant finality and ultra‑high throughput, institutions can settle tokenized Treasury bills or equities as quickly as buying a coffee. AI agents can initiate micropayments on behalf of users, and cross‑chain transactions can occur without liquidity fragmentation.

The shift from re-execution to proof-verification is a foundational step in scaling the base layer. → [Forklog]( - For developers and users: Faster block validation could reduce gas costs, improve dApp responsiveness, and expand validator participation. - Caveat: Real-world conditions may differ — large blocks, peak usage, and network latency could still test the system’s limits. Decentralisation and hardware accessibility remain key factors. --- ### 🔹 My Take This is one of those infrastructure breakthroughs that doesn’t get much attention at first but ends up changing the baseline.

p_1odvw64,"Datasets Hi everyone, I’m working on a project where I need to build an automated system that can determine the price of a cryptocurrency at the exact time a client’s transaction occurred. The idea is simple: for each transaction, take the coin and timestamp, and fetch the corresponding USD price at that moment. For this, I’m looking for datasets that provide **historical cryptocurrency prices** * Coin name or symbol * Timestamp of the price * Price in USD Minute-level resolution or better would be ideal, as cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate rapidly. Datasets can be in CSV, JSON, Parquet. It would be great if the data covers a wide range of coins, not just Bitcoin or Ethereum, since client transactions could involve altcoins as well. If anyone has access to such datasets, whether public, private, or via an API, I’d greatly appreciate it if you could share it. Any tips on working with large historical crypto datasets efficiently would also be helpful. The goal is to make a system that can automatically take a client’s transaction and return the exact price at that moment, so having accurate historical price data is essential.

p_1odllow,"Could CZ’s inner circle have orchestrated the Oct 10 crash? Oct 10 was the biggest liquidation in crypto history with just a little push from macro. How come it was bigger the FTX and Covid? What’s crazy is that this is it's the second time Trump has nuked the markets. The second biggest liquidation day was earlier this year, on Feb 2nd, when new 25% tarifs were announced on Mexico and Canada, 10% on China. That triggered $2.3B in liq across the board. This time, it was a 100% China tariff threat, and the cascade was even worse. The consensus theory now is the USDe depeg on Binance. Their unified margin accounts priced collateral like USDe, wBETH, and BNSOL using their own internal spot books instead of external oracles. During an eight-day window before they switched to safer pricing, someone dumped around $60-90M of USDe on Binance. That tanked the price of USDe to $0.65 only on that venue, while everywhere else it stayed near $1. Since Binance valued collateral off its own order books, that one design flaw instantly wiped billions in margin and triggered a global liquidation cascade that totaled around $19B. Now, two theories are floating around. The first one: this was an external attack. Someone exploited Binance’s internal pricing bug and profited by shorting BTC and ETH on Hyperliquid, making roughly $200M. As I was researching this topic when preparing a yt video it became clear how risky this gamble was - they risked $90M to only make $200M, under insane conditions that could have easily gone wrong. And probably do go wrong most of the times, we just don't know about them as they can easily be throttled by CEXs. The perpetrator had to know every detail about Binance’s internal pricing of USDe, the unified account logic, and the exact timing of the upcoming oracle change (that was published by Binance beforehand). That kind of precision isn’t random. Plus, if it was an outsider, Binance has probably already flagged those accounts. It’s even questionable whether they ever managed to withdraw their USDe after the dump. They might have burned their bridge with Binance forever. The second theory is darker. CZ might have allowed this to happen, or at least known about it. Maybe someone from his circle pulled the strings. Pulling off a move like this required insider-level knowledge of Binance’s internal pricing, the timing of the macro headline, and the delayed oracle rollout. Risking $90M in USDe for a $200M gain doesn’t make sense unless you’re sure Binance won’t freeze your account afterward. But here’s the twist no one came out happy. Big and small market makers, even names like Wintermute, plus retail - everyone got rekt. Binance took massive reputational damage, and sentiment across the board turned negative. If traders or MMs have another option, they’ll take it. Which means Binance as a company couldn’t have benefited from this in any direct way. Still, CZ has already made a big bet on DEX infrastructure with Aster, while Hyperliquid keeps eating into Binance’s volume and open interest every month. So if you zoom out, the event almost fits the larger narrative: the CEX era fading, and Binance’s leadership quietly shifting toward the DEX model.",2025-10-22 22:48:20,ZhenyaV,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit,0.03896531,0.26890507,0.6921296,positive

Who agrees with change in the model and how does this protocol change get pushed out? Here's a few challenges bitcoin has to deal with eventually. 1. There's a rate limit on the number of transactions. So either the number of transactions per epoch or the rate of epochs needs to go up by hundreds of fold to be similar to say Visa. In particular workarounds like lightning network evidently have a model flaw in that it becomes unviable as bitcoin transitions from mining based to fee based. 2.

p_1ochrkz,"UTOPIA: How DFINITY Turns Blockchain into a Real Cloud Alternative UTOPIA, built on DFINITY’s Internet Computer Protocol, runs enterprise grade applications directly on a decentralized blockchain network that replaces traditional cloud infrastructure. Instead of hosting apps in one provider’s data center, it spreads compute and storage across independent nodes operated by different organizations around the world. This means if a single region goes down, like AWS did yesterday, the network keeps running because its logic and data are already replicated everywhere. That resilience comes from blockchain level consensus where every update is verified and finalized across nodes, making tampering or silent failures almost impossible. All other blockchains only handle payments or simple smart contracts, but the ICP blockchain actually hosts full web services on chain, making it a true alternative to centralized servers rather than just a supporting layer. There are still trade offs such as higher latency, longer recovery times for large state data, and the complexity of decentralized governance. Yet those risks are visible and shared rather than hidden behind one company’s firewall.

p_1ocdl0l,What is the likely real case use of major crypto or Bitcoin? I’m going to preface by saying- I actually admittedly don’t understand a lot of the tech behind many of the currencies. But what do you see as the most likely case in 10-20 years of coins being used or Bitcoin itself? Just a store of wealth or more? I’ve held crypto for a number of years (mostly BTC/ETH) but find myself often numb to continual articles about ups and down in the market daily - sort of feel it’s not healthy to watch that - I have stocks and don’t watch them every day or week either. I find the arguments of fiat bad and it going to be replaced by crypto or it’s going to replace it a little cultish. My money in the bank (UK) is 99.9% unlikely to drop 20-50% in value in an hour or 24 hours or longer. My money is pretty safe (not that there’s much of it) and backed by the government should the bank fail - again a very big if and very rare occurrence. I can send money with my banks for free within a few seconds: internationally it would incur an exchange fee but I don’t use that anyway and the fee is sort of minimal really depending on the amount. The rise of ridiculous meme coins and scams is detrimental to seeing any adoption I feel and certainly off putting to people wanting to get involved - and you need security for that to become common. I have funds on exchanges because it’s the most accessible and for me easiest way - and if say for 99% of people if you want a general person to great involved that’s the best way then a cold wallet which security wise makes sense but isn’t as user friendly as a exchange. I see it as an investment and feel most other people and companies do too as do other people my age I know. I don’t know anyone in offline who sees it as a currency replacement say and I see some tiny places taking payment for a coffee with BTC online but I think that’s just a waste of it considering fees and such but hey ho. Is it more the tech being behind adapted by banks that’s happening and due moreso than the coins themselves?

When something has already jumped so high in a year, it’s not the moment to average in, I see it as the time to think about locking in gains. And when the economy is in a downturn and the Fed tightens up, piling into high-risk assets makes little sense. A careful investor knows when to hold back. It’s not about being anti-crypto or anything else. But about knowing when to protect what I have earned. Right now i’m even thinking of having some stock exposure or liquidity as survival, because i still need to deal with rent, food, and fuel costs, and the extras that come with it if traded in the right uex can help. Constantly averaging in during uncertain times can drain someone before the real opportunity even appears. So adding some stock even if it's in my bitget portfolio can still show a way for the two. I know Bitcoin will have its time again, but recovery might take years, much like what happened after the dot-com crash. This phase could be cleansing, pushing out the hollow projects and leaving only what’s real. But don’t rely on old market patterns; this cycle is different, shaped by broader macro forces. The turnaround will come when the stock market steadies, and that could still be a long wait. Keep watching the market with patience, not pressure.

p_1ocacwt,"Best Cryptocurrency Online Casinos — What’s Actually Worth Using? Cryptocurrency online casinos have exploded in popularity over the past few years. With more people using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital coins for gaming, new crypto casino platforms are launching almost every month. But with so many options, it’s becoming harder to tell which ones are actually worth using. Every crypto casino claims to offer fast payouts, provably fair games, and anonymous transactions, but once you start playing, the truth often looks very different. Some of the most talked-about cryptocurrency casinos right now include: Titantreasure Jackbit mbit Stake All of them advertise “guaranteed fairness,” “premium bonuses,” and “next-gen blockchain transparency.” But when you dig a little deeper, it’s not always clear how fair the odds actually are, or whether the games are designed to keep you spinning until your wallet runs dry. A big question in the crypto casino community right now is how transparent and provably fair these sites really are. Most claim to use blockchain verification for their casino games — but do players actually check those proofs, or do we just take the site’s word for it? It’s also worth looking at how these platforms handle withdrawals and live betting. Some crypto casinos advertise instant payouts, but in practice, delays, withdrawal limits, or extra verification steps are still common. And when you’re dealing with crypto volatility, a delay of even a few hours can make a big difference in the value of your winnings. I’m genuinely curious, has anyone here actually made consistent profits or had a positive long-term experience with cryptocurrency online casinos? Have you found any sites that truly live up to the “provably fair” promise and make cashing out simple and fast? Or is crypto gambling more about the entertainment factor, the thrill, the technology, and the community, rather than expecting to walk away ahead in the long run? If you’ve tried multiple platforms, which crypto casinos do you trust most in 2025? Which ones deliver smooth, fair gameplay. which look great on the surface but disappoint once you start wagering real crypto?

p_1oc9hd5,"Quantum Threat to Bitcoin: Overhyped or a Real ticking clock? Most people in crypto focus on short-term price moves or the next halving, but there’s a long-term threat that doesn’t get enough attention: quantum computing. Here’s the thing. Bitcoin’s security relies on elliptic-curve cryptography. That’s what keeps your private keys safe and prevents anyone from forging transactions. The issue is that a powerful quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could, in theory, break ECC. That means it could figure out your private key just from your public key. We’re not there yet. Quantum computers today aren’t strong enough, but researchers estimate it might take around a million stable qubits to break Bitcoin’s encryption. The scary part is that companies like IBM and Google are already making steady progress toward that. And here’s what makes it even more interesting: some governments and major banks are already preparing for the quantum threat. They’re quietly transitioning to post-quantum encryption standards ahead of time. Makes you wonder if they know something the public doesn’t. Then there’s the store now, decrypt later problem. Hackers could already be saving blockchain data, planning to decrypt it once the tech catches up. That could make old BTC addresses and reused keys vulnerable down the line. So what do you think?

p_1obw9wt,"What is the best wrapper for PAXG? I have to admit, I'm kind of a fan of PAXG. PAXG if you don't know is an ERC-20 coin soft-pegged to gold. I've held it for quite a while as my long term flight to safety when not actively trading. That kind of worked out in my favor recently. I'm glad I wasn't trading. I'll tell you what I don't like about it. Pretty expensive to move around. We are talking like $3. Now in the grand scheme of things that's tiny. But what I mean by this is I wish it wasn't just a decent value store. I wish it was transactable. Now this is where I'm going to date how up to date my knowledge is. Not very. I nerded out on crypto quite a while ago and then didn't keep up. Hence the question. In theory there are wrappers that could make it transactable. Probably more wrappers than an old hat like me could keep track of. The question is what would actually be good? I know polygon, solana, and avalanche are used to wrap things. No matter what is picked there can be more that one route to actual funding. One could do a bridge that would incur the high paxg fees at least. One could exchange it on a dex. But then you have to find a dex that has decent activity for what is fairly obscure. I would argue it shouldn't be. I wish wrapped PAXG was a common coin. That's why it's worth asking the new hats. I probably sound like I know more than I do. I'm a technical dude but with the last few years of crypto I've mostly just kept up with vocab. That's a pretty shallow level of understanding. I'm confident in my technical abilities enough to admit when my understanding is shallow in an area. I do think gold is going to keep going up long term. And the demand for exchange in gold is going to go up even faster than that. The perceived future demand for gold based transaction is leading the price. I also think that crypto is about to hit another period of significant volatility, more so than recent. In what direction I don't know, but I fear it might be down. More institutions that need to exchange real value are having to do it more often as they are being confronted with the real-politik of the current era. We are now in an era of massive transition. We think AI is causing a lot of transition in our lives but these transitions aren't isolated to us. Some of the most core institutions are finding themselves in fast moving times compared to what they are used to. Their standard rate of change is usually akin to molasses or pitch. We have fiat currencies coming out of existence, like the Argentine peso, and CBDC being attempted, BRICS trying to be a thing, state sponsored resource competition to get the hardware setup for AI, and proxy conflicts between major powers. And these institutions need to exchange real value when they make changes at the lowest level. Just like we can exchange on-chain and off-chain, institutions have on-chain and off-chain. And they have more demand to do more on-chain activity than they have in the past or think that they may need to do on-chain activity in the near future. And on-chain for them is gold. Meanwhile on the consumer end, with attempts to create CBDC, many are going to want to prefer solutions they own to do the same thing. People are going to want to do fast and convenient crypto. And they are going to want to do it with more stability with something people recognize as having value and governments and institutions recognize as having value being a bonus. And as mentioned before governments and institutions will very much be recognizing gold. An era of gold may be upon us, if we want it. If we can only get the transactability working smooth. So let's figure it out. Let's figure out what we are doing and what the standard is to move gold from phone to phone as fast as possible with the lowest fees. The more of us that know what that standard is the more of us can do it and lead that standard. This can be a good foot wedged in door alternative to CBDC. And if we move fast and get that food in the door quickly we can keep the world crypto and free instead of CBDC and controlled. It also may be harder for government to fight it economically if it exchanges something they themselves need to recognize. So back to the technical side.

p_1oe5sem,"Denmark is ditching the unrealized tax idea — proposal moves to tax only realized gains (like stocks) Denmark looks set to move away from taxing every crypto-to-crypto trade and toward a simpler, stock-like regime that taxes only realized gains when you cash out to fiat. Several signals point the same way: \- On this Danish podcast, Payam says the “mark-to-market” idea is dead and the new proposal would tax real, realized gains similar to shares: [ \- Discussion in r/BitcoinDK about rules targeted for 2026: [ \- Ammar (MP and tax spokesperson, Moderaterne) laid out a simple model in Børsen (Sep 10, 2025): tax only on conversion to DKK, treat gains as capital income, allow loss carryforward, and stop taxing crypto-to-crypto swaps. Why this matters \- Until now, Denmark effectively taxed every swap (even BTC→ETH) under personal income rates up to \~56%, used FIFO, and limited loss offsets. Result: huge admin burden and situations where you could owe tax despite breaking even after volatility. \- The proposed model would look much closer to how stocks are taxed: \- Tax only when you convert crypto to Danish kroner (DKK). \- Crypto-to-crypto trades are not taxable events. \- Gains taxed as capital income (the Danish 27%/42% brackets), not personal income. \- Losses can be carried forward and offset against future crypto gains. \- “One trade, one result”: tax the actual profit (sale minus purchase), not hundreds of line items. A few datapoints (Skattestyrelsen): \- \~10% of Danish adults held crypto last year (\~290,000 people). \- 65% hold under DKK 10,000. \- 86% use crypto as an investment; only 18% as a payment method. Timeline and caveats \- This is a policy shift in motion, not law until Parliament passes it.

p_1oe3ya2,"Bitcoin Beyond Money: The Philosophy of Digital Sovereignty. **By MoBitSo** Money used to have weight. That’s right, it was metallic, cold, and heavy, stamped by kings and trusted merchants who placed more trust in the crown’s face than in the man beside him. Later, it also became paper, promises printed by governments and traded for goods, for labor, and in exchange for time. **Then it comes with screens.** It turns out that money becomes numbers. Invisible but one finds it everywhere. We would not touch our wealth simply sees it appear and vanish at glowing rectangles. It usually felt comforting, but something was lost deeply in translation-the sense of having ownership with what was actually ours. Then the phrase “ownership” becomes just a polite illusion, banks keep your money; governments watch your transactions, and corporations define your digital identity. There is access but no authority. There’s permission but no power. Then, very quietly, in 2009, a pseudonym signed a manifesto. The prophet was Satoshi Nakamoto, the prophet who released a few pages of code and a radical idea: a financial system that needs no kings, no banks, no middlemen. A world where truth would be verified not by institutions but by consensus. Bitcoin was then born not as a product but as a rebellion, a protest against the architecture of control. **But mostly, they did not notice it.** The charts, the speculative frenzy: they were hubbed about price on the greener pastures, treating Bitcoin as a stock or at least as a shortcut to get rich. But to those gawking scholars, Bitcoin revealed something altogether deeper-it was a philosophical machine disguised as money. It is not that bitcoin is made for making you rich; it is made for making you sovereign. To possess your wealth is to possess your will. To move it freely is to move your voice. To verify it yourself is to own your truth. Bitcoin didn’t just reinvent currency; it redefined what it means to be an individual in a digital world. However, in traditional economies, trust flows up. We trust banks to keep our savings safe, central authorities to ensure the fragility remaining intact, and governments and their codes to protect our rights. History is not short of recurring lessons reminding us about painful lessons that power once concentrated doesn’t remember whom it serves. **And that flow is reversed by Bitcoin.** It converts trust into verification, authority into protocol, and hierarchy into visibility. The blockchain doesn’t press for faith-it gives proof, each block a testament, each transaction a declaration that the truth can exist without permission. **This is the silent revolution many still miss out on.** Bitcoin is not just a monument or technological breakthrough but also one philosophical breakthrough. It embodies that very simple but dangerous thought: define how your freedom will be determined, not by the institution but by the individual. Holding your private keys is like holding a digital equivalent of Locke’s natural rights-liberty encoded, property encrypted, consent expressed as a cryptographic signature. Political philosophy becomes software in the form of Bitcoin. Thus, it’s like calling something money as too small to be narrowed down that way. It is not the next version of finance; it is the first version of digital selving. It registers a huge change in human organization; as much as the invention of written law or the printing press, tools that not only change what humans do but what they are. As we enter deeper into an era of surveillance capitalism, progammable currencies, and money, Bitcoin makes more and more sense; it is a mirror that reflects the tension between convenience and freedom, between the comfort of control and the courage of autonomy. What Bitcoin is doesn’t basically make it flawless. What is required is onus. What it punishes is forgetfulness. What it doesn’t provide is refunds and what isn’t acceptable is excuses. All that is precisely the philosophy: freedom with accountability, sovereignty with consequence. We are accustomed to systems that save us from our errors, but these also lock and limit themselves from our independence. Bitcoin invites us to grow up: to become stewards of our own digital lives. **The future will become not who holds the networks but who holds the keys.**",2025-10-23 14:56:53,mobitso,post,bitcoin,,Reddit,0.027395366,0.09137754,0.88122714,positive

p_1odpu77,"How to Make Solana Great Again？ # How to Make Solana Great Again? This article aims to establish a targeted developmental strategy – the ""SOL Focus Strategy"" – under the grand narrative of ICM, covering areas from tokenomic model optimization to secondary ecological development. The north star goal of this strategy is to enhance SOL's value capture capability, thereby incentivizing ecological growth and aligning with the grand narrative of ICM. # 1. Tokenomic Model Adjustment Solana's current excessively high inflation rate has hindered ecological development, which is precisely why SIMD0228 was proposed. Therefore, adjusting Solana's inflation rate is imperative. But what should the specific adjusted rate be? We can first define several soft conditions to determine the final inflation rate and staking rewards: ① A 2% terminal inflation rate is appropriate. The U.S. Federal Reserve also endorses this standard: in 2020, it explicitly incorporated the ""Average Inflation Targeting"" framework into its policy system. While it allows short-term inflation to slightly exceed 2% to offset periods of below-target inflation, it maintains 2% as the long-term core anchor, believing this level is most conducive to sustaining stable tokenomic growth. This logic equally applies to the long-term stable development of the Solana ecosystem. ② SOL should avoid deflation. While SOL deflation may seem to drive price appreciation, we must recognize that Solana, as a high-performance blockchain infrastructure, should derive its value growth primarily from its own ecological development and performance improvements – not deflation. SOL deflation would reduce holders' willingness to deploy SOL in ecological use cases (such as staking, DeFi, and NFT transactions), which would suppress ecological vitality and innovation. Thus, deflation for SOL is undesirable. ③ SOL's staking yield should exceed the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds. RWA (Real-World Assets) is a current hot trend and will be a key development direction in the future. It also serves as a critical narrative pillar aligned with the ICM strategy, as it will bring massive liquidity to the entire crypto industry and introduce products with real-world risk-free rates of return (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds). Consequently, the Solana ecosystem will inevitably integrate RWA products related to U.S. Treasury bonds. SOL's staking yield represents the native risk-free rate of return within the Solana ecosystem, and it will inevitably compete with RWA products. Given that U.S. Treasury bonds carry lower risk than Solana staking, SOL's staking yield must exceed that of U.S. Treasury bonds to remain competitive. Since the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds is approximately 4%, SOL's staking yield should ideally surpass this level. ④ Should SOL earmark a portion of inflationary funds for long-term development? (This requires further consideration.) Would it enhance the attractiveness of the Solana ecosystem if a fixed percentage of the annual inflation rate were set aside as a dedicated treasury, with funds targeted allocated to long-term ecological development and reserved for contingency use? For details on how this treasury should be utilized, please refer to Section 3 below. # Conclusion: Based on the above soft conditions and Solana's foundational context, we can design an initial inflation rate of 3% for SOL: * 0.5% of this rate will be permanently directed to a treasury, ensuring a stable revenue stream for ecological development. * The remaining 2.5% will be used to reward staking participants. Currently, Solana's staking ratio stands at 65% – a relatively high level. After the inflation adjustment, some stakers will be incentivized to unstake and redeploy SOL into the ecosystem to pursue higher returns. If the staking ratio stabilizes at 50%, validators can expect an approximate 5% yield, slightly exceeding the yield of U.S. Treasury bonds. This will maintain the healthy operation and attractiveness of the ecosystem. # 2. Stablecoin Strategy Solana needs a SOL-collateralized stablecoin. # Rationale: At present, the relationship between many public chains and their ecosystems exhibits a zero-sum dynamic. For example, projects like [Pump.Fun]( require SOL as the participation asset for their business model, allowing them to accumulate large amounts of SOL. However, when these projects realize profits, they often sell off SOL to strengthen their own operations – which restricts SOL's inherent growth. Secondly, SOL's price volatility directly impacts the development of many projects within the Solana ecosystem. The prosperity of the ecosystem is highly correlated with SOL's price, which contradicts real-world pricing mechanisms. In traditional public companies, business operations (fiat-settled supply and demand systems) and stock markets (equity value systems) are inherently isolated: entity operations determine stock performance, but stock price fluctuations do not directly affect daily operations. For instance, even amid a stock market crisis, Luckin Coffee was able to maintain revenue growth through proactive business operations. However, the single-token system in the crypto world breaks this isolation: a single token simultaneously serves as the primary medium for the network's commercial scenarios (e.g., gas fees, entry tickets for application participation) and as an investment asset in the capital market. This creates a risky ""double helix effect"": when the token price rises, market sentiment fuels false ecological prosperity; when the price plummets, developers' incomes decline sharply, leading to difficulties in project operation and maintenance. This is analogous to a project facing operational disruptions solely due to a sharp drop in its token price – a scenario that defies common sense yet is prevalent in the current crypto market. Therefore, ensuring that project operations are driven by supply-demand dynamics (rather than capital market fluctuations) is a critical challenge for Solana and the broader crypto market. Replacing the tokens used in commercial scenarios with stablecoins could address both issues mentioned above: * If Solana's ecological applications widely adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins, cashing out these stablecoins would significantly reduce selling pressure on SOL. * Meanwhile, SOL's price would no longer disrupt normal business operations, avoiding the double helix effect. Once a large number of applications adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins for commercial use, a drop in SOL's price will not severely impact their operations. In turn, the stable operation of these ecological projects will provide support for the prices of both SOL and their own tokens. This strategy will also lock up significant amounts of SOL within such stablecoin applications and spawn derivative applications similar to Curve. Additionally, large-scale stablecoin adoption can integrate with the payment ecosystem: an officially launched Solana Payment App could first support SOL-collateralized stablecoins, followed by USDT/USDC and other mainstream stablecoins. Furthermore, the ICM strategy includes not only pure financial applications but also scenarios where traditional businesses are implemented via Web3. Such projects typically use stablecoins or fiat currencies (e.g., USD) for transactions. If Solana officially launches a SOL-collateralized stablecoin and establishes a dedicated entity to handle off-chain USD-to-on-chain stablecoin exchanges, it will attract more traditional businesses to Web3-ize their operations on Solana – further enriching the ecosystem. Most importantly, this stablecoin need not rely solely on SOL as collateral; it can also accept additional assets (e.g., ICM-related assets) as collateral. This would provide a use case for the large capital pools in ICM, enhance the stablecoin's utility by generating additional interest, and attract more users to adopt or hold it – accelerating the development of Solana's stablecoin ecosystem. # 3. Sustainable Development of SOL In the real world, a common economic stimulus method involves: 1. Collecting tax revenue into a treasury; 2. Distributing a portion of the treasury as consumption vouchers to encourage spending; 3. Generating new tax revenue through the commercial activities driven by this spending. This creates a cycle that enables targeted stimulation of desired sectors while ensuring sustainable tokenomic development. The same logic applies to public chains. Many public chains achieve cold start by launching incentive programs, collaborating with applications to attract users. Early users can earn both public chain rewards and application-specific incentives – a win-win scenario. However, many public chains lack sustainable incentive plans and token value capture mechanisms, leading to insufficient funds for long-term ecological incentives and hindering their long-term growth. Thus, Solana's development requires a long-term incentive mechanism to achieve sustainability – which is why Section 1 proposes earmarking a portion of inflationary funds for a treasury. # Specific Uses of the Treasury: The treasury's 0.5% share of the inflation rate will be allocated to five key areas (the exact percentage for each area can be further deliberated, but establishing such a treasury is essential for providing sustained, direction-driven support to Solana): ① Regular incentives (e.g., quarterly) for users of applications with high TVL and transaction frequency. This is a long-term, permanent incentive direction aimed at increasing long-term SOL lock-up and driving more transaction-based burns – ultimately enhancing SOL's value capture from the ecosystem. ② Periodic incentives for specific sectors: For example, one quarter may prioritize incentives for AI application projects, while the next quarter may focus on high-potential sectors like RWA. This mirrors government-specific funds, which provide targeted support for key industries. ③ Targeted support for projects adopting SOL-collateralized stablecoins: Airdrops will be provided to users of projects with higher stablecoin adoption rates. ④ Targeted support for ICM-aligned projects: Funding will be directed to projects that align with the ICM strategy. ⑤ Development regulatory reserves: These funds will be locked in the treasury long-term and only deployed when the staking ratio is insufficient. Their purpose is to incentivize more participants to stake, ensuring Solana's network security. # Fine-Tuning the Burn Mechanism Currently, Solana's burn mechanism operates as follows: * 50% of base fees are burned, and 50% are distributed to validators; * 100% of priority fees are distributed to validators. This mechanism only burns approximately 0.3% of SOL's total supply, making it impossible to achieve the ideal 2% terminal inflation rate. Priority fees can be viewed as excess returns generated by Solana's network prosperity – and these returns should be aligned with SOL's value. This alignment would tightly bind network prosperity to SOL's value capture. For these reasons, we propose revising the priority fee distribution to (The specific ratio can be further discussed.): * 70% to validators, * 20% burned, * 10% reverted to the treasury. This adjustment will enable the treasury to benefit from ecological growth, creating a positive ""recovery-expenditure-recovery"" cycle. It will also enhance SOL's value capture from the ecosystem and, when combined with the treasury's regular incentives, accelerate burns and value capture – ultimately helping achieve the 2% terminal inflation rate target. # 4. The Necessity and Strategic Significance of Solana's Official Applications The launch of official applications by public chains will become an inevitable trend, driven by three key factors: # ① Public chains need to control core applications Core applications play a crucial role in empowering the public chain's token and ensuring ecological stability. If core applications encounter issues, they can disrupt the development of other ecological projects. Thus, managing these applications in-house (by the public chain team) is optimal. For example, Aerodrome – the DEX on Base – was co-launched by the Base team and Velodrome, an established DeFi team. Revenue from Aerodrome can be reinvested to support the Base team's operations. Even if Aerodrome faces issues, the public chain team can provide backup support. In contrast, third-party teams may struggle to recover from hacks or even execute rug pulls – resulting in significant ecological losses. Examples of such core applications include DEXs, over-collateralized stablecoin projects, and Curve-like protocols. These are all suitable for Solana to develop as official, native applications. # ② Public chains need to ensure core applications empower the native token (which is $SOL, not third-party tokens) Ecological applications on public chains employ diverse business models and tokenomic mechanisms. Some accumulate large amounts of the public chain's token and lock in profits by selling it (e.g., Pump.Fun), creating selling pressure on SOL. If Solana officially launches an application with the same functionality as [Pump.Fun]( it can accumulate large amounts of SOL and manage it in ways that minimize ecological impact. For instance: * The revenue could be reinvested into over-collateralized stablecoin protocols to generate stablecoins, with profits used for ecological development; * Users could be required to use SOL-collateralized stablecoins to participate in the application. Such designs would not only reduce negative ecological impacts but also increase demand for SOL and accelerate its value capture. A relevant case is Virtuals Protocol, which mandates that users use Virtual tokens to participate in its token launches. Additionally, newly issued tokens must form trading pairs with Virtual tokens to be traded. While this design partially stems from Base's lack of a native token, similar models are gaining traction on public chains with native tokens. Traditionally, new tokens would form trading pairs with the public chain's native token – a standard practice. However, designs like Virtuals' have led many projects to mandate trading pairs with their own tokens instead. This means value that would have been captured by the public chain's token is now siphoned off by third-party application tokens. To counter this trend, public chain projects must directly compete for ecological empowerment. # ③ Competitive pressure from other public chains An increasing number of ""public chain infrastructure + official applications"" combinations are emerging. The competitive edge derived solely from blockchain technology or ecological empowerment is diminishing; many projects are seeking ways to secure sustained external capital support for their blockchains – with exchange empowerment being the most effective and direct method. Some projects originated as applications and later expanded into public chains to develop their ecosystems. For example, HyperLiquid first launched a permissioned chain-based on-chain contract application, then built an EVM chain to grow its ecosystem – following a ""trading + public chain ecosystem"" logic. This model is being adopted widely: for instance, payment giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm are jointly incubating Tempo, a new blockchain project built specifically for stablecoin payments, which will likely follow a ""payment + public chain ecosystem"" logic. Additionally, Base Chain and BNBChain are typical examples of ""exchange giant + public chain ecosystem"" combinations, both leveraging CEXs to empower their public chains. These models share a common trait: public chains are no longer satisfied with growth driven solely by on-chain applications. Instead, they are integrating off-chain cash flow-generating businesses with their ecosystems – importing additional positive external resources. In the past, Solana's ecosystem was empowered by the FTX exchange, but no such external positive resources currently exist to continuously inject vitality into Solana. Collaborating with another exchange could lead to uncontrollable risks (like the FTX incident). Thus, Solana must build its own positive external empowerment. # Specific Actions Required: Solana needs to build a permissioned chain to host an official on-chain exchange (including spot and futures trading – a long-term goal). The rationale for developing this in-house (rather than assembling third-party projects) is that third-party projects cannot be built around SOL's value capture – they issue their own tokens and design business models to empower those tokens instead. Solana must expand its value capture from ""infrastructure only"" to ""infrastructure + official application suite."" Revenue generated by official applications should be continuously reinvested into Solana's development, creating efficient synergy. A permissioned chain is necessary (rather than building directly on Solana's mainnet) because only permissioned chains can deliver performance and user experience comparable to CEXs – a key advantage of HyperLiquid. Furthermore, HyperLiquid's growing success demonstrates that on-chain contract and spot trading will be a key growth market in the future. This market will not be dominated by a single player; new competitors will inevitably emerge. Solana should enter this space early to compete. Solana's mainnet already hosts substantial capital, users, and projects – an official Solana-based HyperLiquid equivalent could reactivate the ecosystem, similar to how Coinbase empowers Base and Binance empowers BNBChain. Solana needs cash flow-generating applications to provide sustained external positive support for SOL – and it can even develop features that outperform HyperLiquid. For example, traditional institutions' core concerns about entering ICM are ""compliance and security""; an official permissioned chain exchange could address these concerns through ""regulatory alignment + custody guarantees,"" serving as an ""institutional gateway"" to ICM. This permissioned chain could be co-developed with Solana Layer2 Stack projects (e.g., HyperGrid or Other Layer 2 infrastructure teams, such as Altlayer), or built independently by Solana via its own Layer2 Stack. Developing a Layer2 Stack is critical for the broader ICM narrative, as traditional enterprises and investors typically enter on-chain tokenomic development through two paths: 1. Building applications directly on a public chain; 2. Launching their own managed and controlled Layer2s, then building application ecosystems on these Layer2s. The latter path is preferred not only for faster speeds and lower fees but also for ""sovereignty"": enterprises can directly control the Layer2's development and avoid disruptions from other Layer1 applications (e.g., Layer1 performance degradation or short-term gas fee surges caused by a popular application). Additionally, Layer2s enable the development of broader application ecosystems (not just single applications) and capture value from these applications. This explains why Robinhood plans to launch a Layer2 and Stripe is developing a Layer1 – sovereign application chains will be a potential future trend, and Solana's Layer2 Stack can fully enable this narrative. Moreover, Solana's Layer2 can support both SVM and EVM, with potential liquidity interoperability between the two. This will attract projects that require EVM-compatibility but demand lower fees and higher performance – potentially making the migration of Ethereum ecosystems to Solana a new trend. (Solana's growth potential should revolve around the SOL token and its overall network, not exclusively around SVM.) With an official Layer2 Stack, more application scenarios can be migrated to Layer2: for example, a dedicated chain for Solana's DePIN projects or a specialized chain for payment scenarios – reducing the mainnet's load. Expanding further, Solana could also develop an official bridge to connect these Layer2s; the revenue from this bridge could be reinvested to enhance SOL's value. However, it is important to note that Layer2 may reduce value capture from fees in the short term. Thus, the highest priority in the early stages should be completing the official permissioned chain (via Layer2 Stack) to launch a Solana-based HyperLiquid equivalent. # Summary These strategies are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. They will: * Introduce new types of applications to enrich Solana's ecosystem; * Provide diverse value capture mechanisms for SOL, ensuring it correctly captures value from the ecosystem; * Lay a solid foundation for the effective implementation of the ICM strategy (ICM requires a low-inflation environment to encourage the development of new ICM-aligned applications, and a stable ecosystem will attract more traditional capital to participate in Solana); * Prepare Solana for future competition, as an increasing number of chains are leveraging exchanges (CEX/DEX/PERP) for empowerment. Note: The strategic insights presented in this article reflect the author's current views. If given the opportunity to communicate in depth and gain a better understanding of Solana's future plans, the author is capable of developing more aligned strategies, facilitating their implementation, and validating the author's vision for Web3 development. # AfterWord Recently, the BNBChain ecosystem has seen a surge in momentum, and ecosystem activity has experienced a resurgence. While many may view this recent upswing of BNB as merely a short-lived boom, the actual situation is that the industry will develop along two paths: 1. The first path involves the continuous emergence of new hot topics that drive market sentiment, leading to numerous pump-and-dump activities. However, this path will undoubtedly present opportunities for substantial gains, attracting capital, users, and development teams to explore more efficient products and tools around it. 2. The second path focuses on more fundamental inherent needs that better drive industry development, such as directions like RWA (Real-World Assets), AI (Artificial Intelligence), and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks). For public chains, DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges), and CEXs (Centralized Exchanges), the optimal approach is to actively embrace both paths. Therefore, Solana can, to a certain extent, draw lessons from BNBChain’s experience in the first path while exploring the second path based on its own unique advantages. This article represents some reflections on the second path. Of course, the strategy mentioned in this article is only the first step; once this first step is truly taken, there will be a second-phase strategy. I hope to have the opportunity to share more about it in the future. # Answers to Some Questions **Q: Is this approach too centralized?** A: For a public chain, technology can be decentralized, but operationally, a central guiding force is needed to steer its development. Otherwise, it may well be eliminated in the fierce competition. Therefore, a certain degree of centralized operation is acceptable. **Q: Regarding the revised data mentioned in the article, are there more appropriate data points available?** A: The data is definitely not final and requires further discussion, but the overall operational logic is relatively certain. The development pattern of the industry will most likely make public chains, DEXs, and CEXs competitors to one another. Hence, it is necessary to make preparations and plans early. **Q: The article mentions many applications, such as stablecoin protocols, for which there are already existing projects. Why is there still a need for the official team to develop one?** A: SOL-based stablecoin protocols will be among the most important DeFi financial infrastructures and are closely tied to SOL. They need to be overseen by the official team. Because if it were a third-party protocol, the development of that protocol would be aimed at its own growth and would not prioritize the impact on SOL. In contrast, if developed by the official team, the economic flows within it can drive capital repurchases and redistribution for SOL.",2025-10-23 01:57:09,Glittering-Parsley38,post,solana,,Reddit,0.26701757,0.019376928,0.71360546,positive

I've previously researched this using AI, and I'd like to share it with you. I'm not sure what tariffs have to do with Solana, or any blockchain for that matter. Solana, which is generating high revenue year-over-year and doubling in growth, is currently significantly undervalued. Solana is not a risky asset. Solana holds the second-largest DeFi TVL at $11.06B and boasts a DEX daily trading volume of $6.16B, overwhelming all other chains. It boasts unparalleled developers and protocols like Jupiter, Raydium, Sanctum, Backpack, and Helius. It also boasts a diverse portfolio of 2.4 million daily active users, ranking among the top Layer 1s and handling a high daily throughput of 77.9 million transactions. Furthermore, its staking rate is as high as 67%. Once you start using the Solana ecosystem, you'll likely find yourself avoiding other layers due to the convenience it offers. While it's true that reliability is an issue due to a history of downtime, many developers have researched and worked hard to minimize the issues, and we're now seeing Solana handle extremely high traffic levels much better than before. Furthermore, we're currently working to upgrade to Alpenglow, ensuring even greater speed, stability, and security. More importantly, not only Solana, but all on-chain protocols are unrelated to tariffs. Everything that happens on the blockchain has absolutely nothing to do with tariffs. Why should the price drop so absurdly due to tariff news? Are Ethereum or Solana truly risky products? I simply don't understand. I know all too well how much effort and time has gone into creating this ecosystem. It's truly heartbreaking.",2025-10-23 01:23:54,Proud_Inflation6761,post,solana,,Reddit,0.6777902,0.012736782,0.30947298,negative

You don’t want every tiny coffee purchase to hit that base layer, just like you wouldn’t settle every credit card swipe directly with the Federal Reserve.

Good for institutional adoption and big money to enter. ***BUT***, it allows them to create a “Synthetic Supply” that they can then use to draw Liquidity from.

They used the same liquidity that they are pulling from the ETFs to manipulate the market, and rinse out panic sellers. Some Alts were down 50%, this is not normal behavior.

c_nkiisjv,"Bitcoin's the easy winner here. Try testing gold for its purity. You actually need a facility to heat it up to a certain level and see what happens. Now do this at scale. Not so easy now is it? Now try using gold to transact from one place to another. Oh, you got security costs to send the gold, fees to transport the gold, and you have to have the facility in place to store all the gold. Logistics is a nightmare. It's cumbersome. There is a reason why gold paper certificates were issued. However, they are heavily counterfeited and also the people who accept them have to TRUST the holder and issuer of the gold certificates. There's been quite some issues where the issuer ended up having fake gold in their coffers. How do you protect from an employee coming in and swapping out fake brick with real brick and now you have to audit and test them all over again. It's why we very rarely ever have full on gold reserve audits. Now compare that with bitcoin. It's much more simpler to store bitcoin securely and it also has none of the nasty logistical issues with storing and sending. There are risks associated, but as long as one holds the keys, they are the custodian of their future, and we don't need to trust any institution to act in our interests. Whole nations may not have access to bank accounts, completely debanked, cannot trust their financial institutions, and government can even confiscate their assets.",2025-10-21 00:27:07,kyuronite,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit,0.033190835,0.22644387,0.74036527,positive

Many newer protocols (like PoS consensus and L2s) have checks and balances and are designed to be economically secure and inherently resistant to centralization attacks even with only moderate-low decentralization. For example, Ethereum block production is centralized, but block proposal, block validation, and its finality layer are all done by separate groups of validators. And unlike with PoW, there is extremely strong economic incentive for each layer of security to remain honest, so it's able to remain secure than PoW at a tiny fraction of the cost of PoW. Newer protocols have evolved and decoupled security from needing full decentralization because they have plenty of checks and balances.

c_nky3pmz,"Replace ""often gets corrupted"" with ""is always corrupted"". Of course you are correct about how it should be used... but politicians gonna politic - and that means they will never be able to stop pressing the money printer button. Once they print once then they would have to institute austerity measures and/or raise taxes to balance the budget. No politician is going to do that - there will always be another ""emergency"" that means they ""have"" to run the money printer again. And then the debt keeps increasing and the % of revenues it takes to pay the interest on that debt keeps increasing. The only way the system keeps going is by printing more and more and constantly devaluing the currency. Nothing stops this train. Yes, Bitcoin is a superior money to gold, but why do you think any country's leaders would stick to a Bitcoin standard system any more than they have the gold standard? If money has a fixed supply and government's are not able to increase the supply then they are forced to do what you actually suggested and save up an emergency fund. When times are good, save money. Build up a reserve. When emergencies/hard times hit, spend those reserves. When the reserves are used up then government is forced to balance the budget. Short term pain for long term gain, but you don't get re-elected if you are the one implementing the pain part. So no leaders will ever do that if they have a way to run the printer.

c_nkfqsro,"--- 1. Price target assumptions are speculative The argument that SOL “should already be worth $1,000–$3,000” assumes a very high level of adoption and that the crypto market will follow Solana’s usage linearly. Historical precedent shows that usage does not always translate directly into price: both EOS and Tron had periods of high transaction throughput and developer activity without achieving sustained market capitalization growth. Saying “usage drives price” ignores external macro factors, regulatory risk, and investor sentiment, which are all major drivers of valuation in crypto. --- 2. Network outages and reliability matter more than the post admits The post dismisses Solana’s outages as a solved problem, but repeated network failures—even if mitigated—erode confidence from institutional and retail users. Financial applications cannot risk downtime or forks, and Solana’s validator architecture, while fast, creates points of centralization that contributed to past outages. Firedancer and fee markets are solutions in progress, not guarantees. --- 3. Centralization is still an issue The post claims Solana is “more decentralized than every rollup and sidechain,” but the reality is nuanced. A high validator count does not automatically equate to decentralization if network consensus is dominated by a few large stakers. Ethereum L2s may rely on sequencers, but base-layer decentralization and security remain stronger. Solana’s architecture favors speed over censorship resistance, which could be a risk if regulatory pressures or large stakers act maliciously. --- 4. Unified liquidity isn’t a panacea The argument that a single shared state is inherently superior ignores the scalability trade-offs. Modular rollups and L2s on Ethereum deliberately fragment execution to achieve higher security, composability, and settlement guarantees. Solana’s single-layer design may simplify liquidity, but it also limits settlement finality, making it vulnerable to congestion and attacks under extreme usage scenarios. --- 5. Institutional adoption is not guaranteed The post assumes that “once the regulatory structure catches up, institutions will flood in.” History shows that institutions are extremely conservative. Many are still wary of Solana due to past instability, centralization concerns, and regulatory uncertainty. High throughput alone is not enough to convince compliance-heavy actors to commit significant capital. --- 6. Overconfidence in the “asymmetric opportunity” The bullish post treats short-term price corrections as inconsequential to the thesis, but crypto markets are highly sentiment-driven. A network that sees another outage or a significant loss of user trust could suffer a much larger, longer-term price impact than predicted. Accumulating through Phantom and staking assumes continuous trust and adoption, which is not guaranteed. --- 7. Comparative advantage vs Ethereum may be overstated While Solana is fast, Ethereum’s modular approach allows for secure settlement, diverse application composition, and composability with L2 ecosystems. Saying Solana “has already won the application layer” is misleading—Ethereum and its rollups host billions in TVL, countless DeFi protocols, and increasingly sophisticated smart contract logic. Solana’s ecosystem is still dwarfed in terms of value secured, risk-adjusted throughput, and composable infrastructure. --- Summary: Solana has technical strengths—speed, low fees, and growing developer activity—but equating these with a $1,000+ price target ignores historical precedent, risk factors, and market psychology. Outages, centralization, regulatory uncertainty, and competition from Ethereum L2s all remain material challenges. SOL may continue to grow, but the bullish narrative underestimates the complexities and overstates adoption-to-price correlation.",2025-10-20 06:53:18,RefrigeratorLow1259,comment,solana,,Reddit,0.05835041,0.15508556,0.78656405,positive

c_nki5oj8,"I'm a huge Solana fan, but the asset isn't being designed to appreciate in value. For good reason: It will increase fees. You don't want to spike the price of SOL and destroy the driver of growth: fast and cheap transactions. A high price would also lower staking yields eventually. Better you keep the asset at a reasonable price (under 200 USD) and stable and that means LSTs and native staking are reliable returns. You don't want to underestimate the damage sub 3% staking yields are doing to ETH staking long term. And whilst ETH might have more ETH in LSTs, Solana has always had a much higher overall staking rate. BTC holdings are nothing compared to savings deposits, and the only way to use BTC is to sell it, and we've seen what even small sell-offs (relative to the size of the overall BTC market) can do to the price. You can withdraw and spend yield in a lot more sustainable way. At a lower, stable, price SOL can be a multiples bigger MC simply via managed inflation. If new SOL is absorbed with no impact that's a growth engine. People hate volatility. No one fully trusts assets that wildly swing in value. Anyway, after the unmitigated disaster ""ultrasound money"" was on Ethereum (which saw apps and user encouraged to LEAVE the L1) and the brainrot 'digitial gold' of BTC (most BTC isn't even traded on the Bitcoin blockchain anymore... FM....), seeing a blockchain win by simply doing a heap of what it's designed to do, process transactions, is incredibly bullish. The biggest 'line go up' opportunity in Solana isn't SOL itself: it's the apps. BAM (from Jito) and Apenglow open the door to application level sequencing. Which is to say, there is no reason why a popular app needs to leave to build it's own chain to capture more of the value it's sending to the L1 and control the experience for their users. They can do that on Solana.

c_nl0iqwy,"Dear Mr ***** Thank you for your message regarding the availability of the iShares Bitcoin ETP on the platform. While our investment view remains that Bitcoin is not an asset class and we do not believe cryptocurrencies possess the characteristics necessary for inclusion in long-term investment portfolios focused on growth or income, we do recognise that some clients wish to speculate in this area. Accordingly, we are developing a service to enable appropriate clients to access crypto Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs), with trading expected to be available early next year. Please note that crypto ETNs have been classified by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as Restricted Mass Market Investments (RMMIs), and as such, are considered high-risk and not suitable for all retail clients. Before being permitted to trade, clients will need to complete an appropriateness assessment, and in some cases, exposure to such products may be limited to 10% of a client’s total portfolio. In relation to your specific query, we are aware that several providers, including CoinShares, have launched physically backed crypto ETNs listed on the London Stock Exchange, which is a requirement set by the FCA for crypto ETN accessibility. While the iShares Bitcoin ETP is not currently available on the HL platform, we continue to assess client interest and the range of eligible ETNs available on UK exchanges. Should sufficient demand be identified, we may look to make such products available in due course. I hope this has been of assistance. If you have any further questions, please reply by secure message from your HL account.

c_nko9pou,">Melania Trump Used as'Window-Dressing' in Elaborate Memecoin Fraud, Legal Filing Claims The first lady of the United States became a pawn in an intricate memecoin scam that resulted in millions of dollars in losses, crypto investors have alleged. A cryptocurrency promoted in January by US first lady Melania Trump was part of a sophisticated fraud that ""leveraged celebrity association and'borrowed fame' to sell legitimacy to unsuspecting investors,"" a new legal filing has alleged. In April, crypto investors brought a federal class action lawsuit against Benjamin Chow, cofounder of crypto exchange Meteora, and Hayden Davis, cofounder of crypto venture capital firm Kelsier Labs, among other defendants, accusing them of a multimillion-dollar fraud involving a single memecoin, $M3M3. Later, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, expanding the allegations to include racketeering activity. They claimed the pair had colluded to rig the market for $LIBRA, a coin promoted by Javier Milei, president of Argentina, which collapsed in value shortly after launch. So apparently nothing filed against Melania / Trump directly. I didn't see the whole article since it was paywalled, but kinda weird that they don't even name who filed it. But on [ Looks like it's a guy named Jonathan Clarke along with Rodrigo Ferreira Da Cruz Vogt, and when he first filed it, he filed it incorrectly lol. Not saying that all the Trump crypto stuff is okay, but it's sorta clickbait too. Kind of interesting at least. >“Publicly, M3M3 was presented as a Meteora project,” the suit reads. “In reality, M3M3 was a collaboration between Meteora and Chow, on the one hand, and defendant Kelsier, a venture capital firm run by the Davis defendants (a father and two sons),” adding that the defendants concealed their involvement.""",2025-10-21 22:37:57,brucekeller,comment,cryptocurrency,,Reddit,0.029245133,0.46907768,0.50167716,positive

As far as I know the report is not yet publicly available, but news sites report about it already. As expected Ethereum has the largest active developer share overall and also the majority of new developers flocked to Ethereum. Ethereum has a pretty nice lead and growth overall. Obviously, Solana does not like to lose in gameable metrics, so the head of developers relation made a large commit to the electric capital github repository to make sure all the solana developers are ""properly"" tracked. They wanted to add 7816 solana repositories. As expected many of these repositories are dead, have nothing to do with Solana or are even Ethereum repositories. I am sure the goal was that Solana devs are are counted properly... The Solana devrel even wanted to list Nethermind, an Ethereum client, as a Solana repository. Yes, really. The electric capital maintainer of the repo filtered through the list and with a minimal filter and suggests to throw out more than a third of the entries. I looked at a handful of projects on that list myself and I have to say it looks like 80% are either non existent, not solana related or not really more than a person copy pasting a tutorial.

I believe most of the big DAT companies are better positioned than ETFs, CEXs, and LSTs to grow your investment in ETH, the asset...

c_nkmxry0,"I had the privilege of writing a guest post for Ethereum's social media accounts (thank you!), and it was posted just now so I thought I'd share it here with you as well. My post ([Twitter link]( starts by introducing the concept of client diversity, one of the primary reasons for Ethereum's impressive track record of zero downtime. The main topic of the post, however, are multi-node validator clients. I'm the maintainer of one such validator client called [Vero]( Multi-node validator clients connect to different Ethereum clients (think Geth, Lighthouse, ...) simultaneously, combine their data, and only cast a validator vote if multiple Ethereum clients agree on the state of the chain. This way, validators can make sure they are not voting for an invalid chain. Remember [how the Holešky testnet blew up a few months ago]( Back then, an invalid chain was voted on by more than 2/3 of the network, causing mass slashings, and resulted in a network that was very difficult to get back online at all. Now imagine that kind of thing happening on mainnet. It would be catastrophic for Ethereum. A client-diverse, Vero-powered setup would _not_ have voted for that invalid Holešky chain. If we'd had higher adoption of those kinds of setups, we would have saved ourselves a lot of trouble. It's too late for Holešky now, but it's not too late for mainnet. With Vero, I hope to make Ethereum even more resilient than it is today. ___ A few FAQs for the stakers around here. > What about DVT? That also protects against client bugs, right? Currently, DVT only protects against downtime bugs, not consensus bugs. Both SSV and Obol are working on addressing this, so that will help at some point in the future. I personally believe multi-node validator clients, like Vero and Vouch, are the better choice for validators managed by a single entity, whereas DVT shines when multiple node operators are involved. > I'm a home staker, should I use Vero? You _can_. It's free, open-source. It's simple enough to set up, even for home stakers, and gives you additional protection. Having said that, I believe the true responsibility to run these more complex, multi-node setups lies with the professional staking node operators out there.

It will be available in a month for around $250 or 250 Euro. What makes this announcement special though is that Trezor built their own secure element chip. They created a new company called tropico square which developed this chip ( This secure element chip is fully auditable by security experts. Interested parties can order samples without having to sign an NDA and then publish their findings openly. To the best of my knowledge, all other secure element chips need you to sign an NDA and if you find security vulnerabilities you are not allowed to talk about them with anyone else. Trezor said they looked through so many secure element chips and found gaping holes in them which they are not allowed to talk about to anyone and the producer did not care. According to Trezor, many of these vulnerable secure element chips are widely used in the hardware wallet market. The most open secure element chips you could get until today were ones which allowed you to open source the code you ran on them, but most do not even allow that. That is why many hardware wallets are at least partially closed source and you have to trust the manufacturer to a large degree to not change the software under the hood without you knowing. For me, the introduction of this auditable secure element chip is a very positive development. It will take some time until it will have an impact on the market.

c_nknf9nf,"For ENS, I explored how we could read trustless state from Polygon PoS with [Unruggable]( Gateways. I was able to create a solution ([gateway]( and [verifier]( but it required some additional tech. This was a year or so ago, so the details are hazy. The basic idea was there is an immutable [`RootPoster` contract]( which emits a log containing the [latest blockhash](#eventlog). Eventually, this transaction gets included into a checkpoint that Polygon commits to L1. You can then use the existing `/exit-payload/` API to generate a proof of that transaction, prove it emitted the log, and prove the value (blockhash) in the log. The gateway can supply a witness that contains this exit proof + the block header ingredients. Combined with the onchain checkpoint, the onchain verifier can verify the exit proof, confirm it matches the block header, and then extract the state root, and then prove arbitrary state on Polygon using additional `eth_getProof`'s. For a demo, I funded an EoA with a few bucks and ""posted"" hourly blockhashes with a bot for a few weeks. The contract is trustless so literally anyone can pay gas (eg. [`post()`](#writeContract)) to include a transaction into a checkpoint. The trust is minimized to the poster contract (which is trivial to audit) and the validity of the checkpoints (which I believe is shared with bridge withdrawals.) The onchain verifier is bound to a specific poster contract address and Polygon checkpoint contract (`IRootChain`). // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.23; contract RootPoster { event NewRoot(bytes32 indexed prevBlockHash); function post() external { emit NewRoot(blockhash(block.number - 1)); } }",2025-10-21 20:13:43,adraffy,comment,ethereum,,Reddit,0.031951606,0.027823022,0.94022536,positive

c_nknjkpo,"Happy to share we launched Seba today! It's a protocol building further onto Heroglyphs where you can earn rewards in perpetuity in return for foregoing your validators execution rewards for 6 months. After 6 months you can graduate and receive an amount of shares equal to your validators attestation rewards over that 6 month period (multiplied by a boost for aligned validators like Stakers Union). However, you can only graduate if you (or someone else) proposes a block containing a graffiti with your validator id in it 👀 Execution rewards are accruing 50% in a yield strategy where it earns ~10% apy (in usd value) and 50% is converted to sBOLD and streams directly to the vault where the validators can claim it with their earned shares. The generated yield is also streamed to the vault, while the principal will earn yield forever for the vault (hence the perpetual rewards). We hope this makes solo validating a bit more attractive again.

c_nkxzyln,"I'm as bullish as ever on Ethereum and im not selling until at least 2030 so i can see all this adoption happen and all this tech finally become what we were dreaming about for the last 8+ years. But me and other people here are losing hope of seeing crazy high prices for ETH. And let's break it down instead of just complaining: In the last 8+ years, remember these sentences? -""when institutions will come, we will be rich"" -""when Ethereum scales successfully with layer2's and the insane fees are gone, massive price gains will happen"" -""when we start burning ETH with EIP-1559, the price will skyrocket"" -""when Ethereum transitions to POS, the 99.9% energy consumption drop and green narrative will finally convince the world to buy ETH"" -""the 90% issuance drop in ETH from moving to POS, aka the triple halvening will create a supply/demand that will make the price of ETH pump like never before"" -""when Ethereum enables staking, everyone will buy ETH to stake and the price will go parabolic"" -""if ETH had a Michael saylor, ETH would be double it's ATH easily"" (ETH treasury companies now own more % of the supply compared to bitcoin treasuries) -""if Ethereum had ETF'S, ETH would be doing as well as BTC"" -""if Ethereum had a spokesperson to teach everyone about Ethereum, the world would buy ETH"" (we have etherealize now for a while, huge respect to them) ""-if Ethereum had someone like Michael saylor to talk about Ethereum on tv and podcasts and interviews, ETH would skyrocket"" (we have tom lee now) Let's be real, Ethereum has so much things happen that this list is probably way longer. And there will be many more bullish catalysts for Ethereum because Ethereum's fundamentals and upgrades and upcoming tech is so huge and amazing. And there are 2 that i can already think of: -""when layer2's start paying for blobs, ETH price will go up"" -""when ETH ETF'S get staking, tradfi will buy ETH at unseen amounts resulting in huge pumps"" But i just can't help wondering of that huge list of insane bullish stuff happened and the price is under $4000, then are those 2 new things really going to pump ETH? Or will they be added to the list above, things that are insanely bullish but did nothing for the price... Again, i remain max bullish for Ethereum and im staying to see this play out because tokenization, stablecoins, ai,... Etc. Is all about to explode and the majority is clearly happening on Ethereum. When all the financial giants are publicly announcing their layer2's and saying tokenization and stablecoins are going to take over the financial world, when trillions of dollars go onchain in the upcoming years, and the exchange ETH reserves going down more than any girl I've ever met, the price of ETH must go up right... There is no way it doesn't, and im fucking staying untill then. So fuck this depressing dogshit for now, it is what it is, Ethereum is winning, mass adoption is on the horizon, our time will come and ETH will be worth at least 5% more than it is now,... we just need a bit more of that agonizing, excruciating, torturous, harrowing, unbearable, insufferable and distressful thing called patience.",2025-10-23 13:13:18,Decentralizedbanana,comment,ethereum,,Reddit,0.058322877,0.026335178,0.9153419,positive

c_nkmisnl,"Just buy something true and hold it long-term. Most of the market is still trading at bear market prices. I'd say anything that isn't lobbying the government, is going to pump really hard in the future. Most of the current market investment is centered in the lobbyist group crypto networks, and practically most investors don't have the strong will to power through the short-term dips. Everything that has cryptographic value will be used in the future, and will be bought for all-time low prices because that's why there is a focus to undermine valued networks. The biggest gains are on the cryptocurrencies that worth the least, but offer the most. So if you're a struggling maximalist in x network (from previous cycle(s)), I wouldn't really worry too much, as long as your network remains relevant, and offers something others don't? There is going to be demand for technological advancement eventually and there isn't much out there for advancement in the currently-hyped networks that are pumping the most! Out of all the lobbyist groups, I'd say Cardano is the only one offering something that the other groups don't have. Solana is easiest to build on, with the latest innovations, but their market is ripe with corruption, something that stifles advancement.

With all non-solo payout schemes everyone agrees to share the reward so that they can get fractions of payouts when their miners do not find the block but someone else in their ""pool"" does. As far as Bitcoin cares - it was and always be one miner - one block finder. There is no difference other than the payout that the pool does upon receiving the reward. Now some pools can submit it to where the coinbase pymt itself splits to each miner automatically but not too many pools do this - typically it pays to the pools wallet, they remove their fee and then payout to all the miners based on their payout agreement.

c_nkftqnw,"Yes! We’re back. Hello again $4,000 per ETH. There was lot of whining about the price lately, so now is a good time to think rationally about what’s next.. and you’ve got two options.. Option one, you take the Red pill and sell (some). Yeah, why not. We’re basically in all-time-high territory again. ETH hasn’t spent more than about 100 days above $4000 in it’s 10 year existence. If you’ve been around long enough (for me that means more than two full cycles measured bottom to bottom), it’s more than fair to start thinking about taking some chips off the table. But no need to go all-out, maybe start DCA’ing out 10%, 20%, 30% of your stack over the next few months. That way, if we keep running, you keep on selling higher. If we retrace, you locked in some of those sweet sweet gains. Or, option two, you take the blue pill and hold (and maybe even add a little if you’ve got dry powder left). ETH never moves in straight lines. First it crabs. Long stretches of sideways action, then sloping down into seemingly nothingness. That’s the refuelling phase. The part where conviction gets tested and week hands get shaken out. And then.. it explodes. Those face-melting, dopamine-spiking, screen-refresh-every-five-minutes kind of moves. The ones that - unfortunately - are over before you even realize what’s happening. Arguably, we had (a rather mild) one this summer. We did a 2.5x from the bottom in nine weekly candles. Further back we’ve seen 5x, 8x, even 10x bursts. Same rhythm every time: long, boring compression, then violent expansion. So yeah, it could happen again. Tom Lee says so. You could argue we’ve been coiling since 2021. Fundamentals seem again ahead of price, the charts look good, weekly RSI has cooled off around 50.

So all you would need to do is send your bitcoin to an address that does not have a revealed public key (an address which has not sent anything) 3. ⁠Bitcoin could transition to a quantum secure signature scheme SPHINCS+. SPHINCS+ have already been standardised by NIST as a post quantum secure signature scheme so this is a relatively obvious soft or hard fork when the time comes. Finally, you have cryptocurrencies such as Verus (VRSC) which are quantum ready. Verus uses a hashing algorithm which is based on Haraka v2 which is an underlying hash algorithms for SPHINCS+ signature scheme.

If the traders were not leveraged then having a flash crash is just another buying opportunity. If you want to sue somebody, sue Trump. It’s most likely that he made the tweet intentionally with this exact market manipulation in mind fully knowing the exact consequences and the payoff to what I assume were his sons. The plays for those who like risk are often good and not as dangerous as they are right now. Anyone who gets into heavy leverage and bets on markets that are this volatile now is asking to be wiped out. There’s no cause of action here. Sometimes trading systems do get overwhelmed. Even huge exchanges like NYSE or NASDAQ can go down when something like this happens. When a state actor communicates news similar to what he has in the past 10 months that has rocked markets every time, you have to assume that he will again. Especially if it makes his family massively rich in less than a day. You should expect that to happen over and over.

c_nkms907,I bet you haven’t try to move large amounts of money across country borders. Here is my explanation on why stable coin offers an advantage: Cash has to come from or through a bank. Banks have rules and are often tied to country’s rules as well. Once you have exchanged cash for stable coin it can be instantly transferred anywhere digitally without all those boundary rules. Stable coin’s value should be stable since it is tied to a currency like the dollar. So if you buy one coin for one dollar and the world turns upside down you still have one stable coin worth one dollar. Even if that dollar is now worthless you still have one. Stable coin can be exchanged for digital assets instantly and without all the banking rules and country rules. It can be done at anytime of day or any day of the week. Hopefully that helps,2025-10-21 18:26:28,torpedoseal,comment,cryptocurrency,,Reddit,0.051245537,0.028380355,0.9203741,positive

c_nknnvw8,"1. Is it just dollars in crypto form? Yes. 2. Is it pointless? No. You need something to buy and sell crypto against. On an exchange like Coinbase or Binance, you can use regular money and let them deal with the technical details. Out on the chain, this is not possible. A stand-in for regular money is needed. 3. What does ""out on the chain"" mean? BTC the coin exists on the Bitcoin network. ETH the coin exists on the Ethereum network. SOL the coin exists on the Solana network. There are other things on these networks besides their namesake coin. Doing stuff with those ""other things"" is called on-chain activity. Such as DeFi and NFTs. Chain here is short for blockchain. The network is the thing that creates/stores(enables the existence of) the blockchain. Short intro done. Can you really make ~~8-10%~~ money on stablecoins? If so, how? Yes. By, in one way or another, funding on-chain activity aka selling shovels. If you get good at it, you can make a lot more than 8-10%. How?... That's like asking what career should I pick.

c_nkn6x4e,"In short: currently, you can earn high yields from holding and staking. You're probably better off for risk to buy crypto that will match or beat that return, currently. In the next few years, (officially beginning 18 months from July 18, 2025, assumedly, when the stablecoin bill was signed) banks will begin custody of stablecoins and Bitcoin, Litecoin, Eth, and other cryptos. Once the banks hold stablecoins and other crypto, utility companies will begin accepting payment in crypto. Then average stores. That means you can hold Bitcoin and Litecoin at your bank, sell what you need for the week or month, buying stablecoins, and pay your bills. Or buy your groceries. You'll never need to hold real dollars. And the stablecoin issuer must have a 1:1 asset on the books, so banks can buy yielding treasury bonds to hold in order to issue stablecoin equivalents, and they can earn and allow you to stake to earn for what you're holding in stablecoins, probably more than a savings account, as they can use higher yield long term treasuries to get higher yields themselves. You might get 4%. The law says that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot pay a return on holdings, by say, staking. But there is a loophole that says another 3rd party can. It's a whole new layer of finance. You would think: I never use a real dollar? That sounds bad for the dollar, why do this? Because for every stablecoin issued, an equivalent monies must be held in lock up. So it still preserves the holding of dollars while *you* never actually use a real dollar. This is actually good for the supply of dollars. It will actually lock up *more* money, which lowers inflation. And the stablecoins are Layer 2, and can be run on chains like Sui that finalize the transaction faster than visa does.",2025-10-21 19:34:56,Ok_Reputation9512,comment,cryptocurrency,,Reddit,0.051645864,0.052450117,0.895904,positive
c_nkmr91j,"> Apparently you can earn like 8-10% on stablecoins which is way more than my bank gives me (literally nothing) No, you can't. A high yield savings account is 4% and is guaranteed by the government. Anything higher than that represents higher risk.

Just ask the people who got burned by TerraLuna. Don't listen to your friend and don't invest in anything you don't understand.

c_nkoett4,"Stablecoins offer several advantages over cash: 1. Speed and Cost: Crypto transactions, including stablecoin transfers, are often faster and cheaper than traditional bank transfers, especially for cross-border payments. 2. DeFi and Crypto Ecosystems: Stablecoins are native to blockchain networks, enabling seamless use in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, smart contracts, or crypto exchanges without needing to exit to fiat. 3. Stability with Crypto Benefits: USDC maintains a stable value (pegged to USD) while allowing users to stay in the crypto ecosystem, avoiding the volatility of BTC or other cryptocurrencies. 4.

c_nky6jmf,"So UTXOs are just inherently simpler when it comes to state. A UTXO either exists or it doesn't. When you're building ZK proofs you're basically just proving ""this UTXO exists and I can spend it"". With account models you have to prove the entire current state of an account (balance, nonce, etc) and since that's constantly changing you end up with way more complex state management in your ZK circuits. The bigger issue imo is the centralization risk with account models. Most ZK rollups using accounts (zkSync, StarkNet, etc) rely on centralized sequencers because account balances HAVE to update sequentially ). You can't process two txs from the same account without knowing the order. So whoever runs the sequencer can front-run, censor, extract MEV... basically defeats the whole point. Privacy is also way better with UTXOs since they naturally break the input/output link. You can prove you're spending valid UTXOs without revealing which ones. Account models inherently tie everything to an address, so even with ZK you need extra layers to get similar privacy. In proof generation, with account models you often need to track the entire global state which means only entities with massive compute resources can generate proofs.

c_nknsb66,"Glad you got it back, that's a relief. The ink fading problem is way more common than people think. Our clients who work on custody solutions see this constantly, people store seed phrases in ways that seem secure but don't account for physical degradation over time. Regular pen and paper isn't archival quality. Ink fades from light exposure, paper degrades from humidity, and stuff gets damaged in fires or floods. If you're storing significant value you need better materials than whatever notebook you had lying around. Metal seed phrase backups exist for this exact reason. Companies like Billfodl or Cryptosteel let you stamp or arrange letters into stainless steel plates that won't degrade. They're fireproof, waterproof, and the letters don't fade. Costs like $50 to $100 which is nothing compared to potentially losing your crypto. If you're going the paper route at least use archival quality paper and permanent ink designed for document preservation. Store it in a dark dry place, not sitting on your desk getting hit by sunlight. Multiple redundant copies in different locations help too in case one gets destroyed. The brute forcing approach you mentioned does work for missing words but three is pushing it. The computational difficulty grows exponentially with each missing word.

c_nkqxp0s,"yeah, I thought it was enough, but clearly it is not. TBH I always thought keeping the seed phrase safe is THE major problem of crypto. The way I see it, that part needs to go away for adoption. That means trusting a 3rd party with the keys, handling an id/password recovery on top of it. Basically... state trusted and insured companies... like banks. No regular person will be going to the extent of forging plates and using cold storage protection. Honestly I am a geek, and I wont go there. This was a hard lesson for me, which fortunately ended well. I'll probably keep like half an ETH and BTC dust on a CEX, but that is it for me.
