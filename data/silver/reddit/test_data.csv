p_1ogl2wq,"what actually caused CZ's pardon? Turns out it was months of expensive lobbying. CZ served 4 months in prison last year for violating antimoney laundering laws. got out, then Trump pardoned him. But according to Politico’s reporting and public lobbying filings, that pardon didn’t just happen... binance and CZ spent serious money trying to make it happen. In late september, binance hired Ches McDowell ...described in multiple reports as tied to Trump’s circle and close to Donald Trump Jr.... to lobby the White House and treasury. his firm, Checkmate Government Relations, disclosed $450k for roughly one month’s work on “financial services policy and executive relief” targeting the White House Office and Treasury Department. And that’s just one piece of it. In March, Zhao also hired Teresa Goody Guillén... a crypto lawyer who had been reported as under consideration for SEC chair.... to lobby the White House for “executive relief.” Reports indicate her firm has received around $290,000 from Binance and Zhao in 2025. overall, reports put binance’s 2025 lobbying around $860k so far. separately, the trumplinked World Liberty Financial venture launched this year and has clear Trump family connections, though there’s no public filing showing a formal Binance partnership. Coverage describes significant paper gains and fundraising around that venture, with estimates and amounts varying across outlets. Rep. Maxine Waters called the pardon a favor for “crypto criminals,” arguing it came after months of lobbying and money flowing into Trumplinked crypto ventures. Trump defended the move by saying Zhao “was persecuted by the Biden administration” and that what he did “wasn’t a crime.” But CZ pleaded guilty to violating U.S. antimoneylaundering laws and accepted a fourmonth sentence. What’s clear is this wasn’t some random act of mercy ..... it followed a concentrated, expensive lobbying push aimed at senior executivebranch offices using Trumpworldconnected lobbyists. They hired heavyweight lobbyists, spent serious money, and operated within Trumplinked crypto circles throughout 2025. It’s a pretty stark reminder of how deep regulation and influence now run in crypto. The same compliance systems that failed at the top are the ones regular investors are expected to handle on their own accurately, every tax season, with no lobbyist to clean up the mess later. That’s why a lot of traders I know have started automating the boring side tracking trades using awaken, wallets, and tax exposure in real time just to stay ahead of the gray areas. Because in this space, *not knowing* the rules costs you more than any lobbying bill ever could. Whether that’s just how Washington works or something closer to corruption depends on your perspective. But the pardon undeniably arrived after a costly and highly targeted influence campaign.",2025-10-26 14:48:45,Gullible-Tale9114,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

So I created [**Polywhaler**]( a website that tracks large whale trades and potentially suspicious activity across Polymarket in real time. You can see: * Every non-sports trade over $10k * Which markets whales are suddenly piling into + trade impact on odds * A calculated “insider score” (might suggest someone knows something) * Add crypto wallets to your watchlist to track specific traders * Discord alerts for live whale trades * Crypto price prediction markets (experimental, but fun to track) It’s still early and pretty barebones, but would love to hear feedback or feature ideas, especially from anyone who follows Polymarket or enjoys watching these new internet markets and how accurate they are on predicting events.

p_1offh3e,"My true thoughts on Cardano Long time holder here Never thought I’d be writing this but here we are. Cardano today is not where I thought it would be when I first bought in January 2021. At the time we were sold on the idea that Cardano would “change the world” and that we would “bank the unbanked” Today we are no closer to that vision in my opinion. Don’t get me wrong. I’ve had some personal success working with projects early on writing content and such. It’s now my full time job. But I’ve been immensely disappointed by progress on many fronts including scaling, native USDC, support for content creators like myself, and overall lack of support for builders. I also thought that governance would be the thing that really brings Cardano forward. But it’s brought a ton of infighting The community always seems to be fighting about what proposal gets funded and what doesn’t. And it’s exhausting. And demoralizing Catalyst, a grant fund, seems as though it’s been somewhat corrupted by people who know how to work the system to get money to fund unprofitable projects But that’s a separate issue I’ve been diversified out of Ada for a while now because of the above reasons and more. I was a long time, hardcore advocate for Cardano in the early days especially in this subreddit. Now not so much. In terms of Defi, the rest of the industry has surged way ahead of Cardano and it’s not even close. I’ve learned a lot since coming into crypto in 2019. I think the most important lesson I’ve learned is to just try everything and not lock myself down too hard into one place. I’m grateful for all the opportunities I’ve been awarded nonetheless and especially grateful for all the friendships I’ve made. At this point I can call some of them my fam. Those are my raw thoughts on Cardano Opti out Edit: for what’s its worth, I say this as someone who’s been deeply embedded in the Cardano community for a long time. What I say in this post is the current state of things. Who knows how things change in the future",2025-10-25 02:47:13,Optimal_Store,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

p_1oherdt,"What if the real Bitcoin bull run starts after everyone gives up in 2025? I’ve been thinking a lot about Bitcoin’s price action this year, and something just feels *off*. It’s been unusually quiet.. almost *suppressed?* Historically, we’d be deep into the parabolic phase of the 4-year cycle by now, but instead, Bitcoin seems to be held back. Here’s my theory: We might be witnessing deliberate suppression by powerful players, the kind of “elites” who understand Bitcoin’s long-term potential and want to ensure that *most people never get to own much of it*. Think about it, it’s now Q4 2025, and everyone’s expecting a market top soon. Many holders are probably planning to sell, expecting a brutal bear market in 2026 (just like in past cycles). Meanwhile, the Fed is pivoting, lowering rates and ending QT. So what happens? If Bitcoin doesn’t go parabolic by the end of this year, a lot of people will lose faith. They’ll sell, sit on the sidelines, and wait for a “classic” 50–60% drop next year to buy back in cheaper. But what if that drop *never comes*? What if, instead, early 2026 is when Bitcoin *finally* takes off, breaking far above $200k when most retail investors are out of the market, expecting a bear? By then, the big players (who’ve been quietly accumulating) will already hold massive positions. They won’t let Bitcoin dump again because they know it’s the future of money and they’ll want to control the scarce supply before it becomes completely out of reach for regular people. So maybe 2025’s “boring” price action is the setup. The real move might start when everyone’s least expecting it, right after most people sell. PS: in case you wanna comment on AI, yes, this post has been written with the help of AI just to make it easier to read and fix grammar mistakes, but the idea comes from my own thoughts and AI summed it pretty well.

p_1of9qyf,"I built an AI that actually knows Ethereum's entire codebase (and won't hallucinate) I spent a year at Polygon dealing with the same frustrating problem: new engineers took 3+ months to become productive because critical knowledge was scattered everywhere. A bug fix from 2 years ago lived in a random Slack thread. Architectural decisions existed only in someone's head. We were bleeding time. So I built ByteBell to fix this for good. # What it does: ByteBell implements a state-of-the-art knowledge orchestration architecture that ingests every Ethereum repository, EIP, research papers, technical blog post, and documentation. Our system transforms these into a comprehensive knowledge graph with bidirectional semantic relationships between implementations, specifications, and discussions. When you ask a question, ByteBell delivers precise answers with exact file paths, line numbers, commit hashes, and EIP references—all validated through a sophisticated verification pipeline that ensures <2% hallucinations. # Under the hood: Unlike conventional ChatGPT wrappers, ByteBell employs a proprietary multi-agent architecture inspired by recent advances in Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG). Our system features: 1. **Dynamic Knowledge Subgraph Generation**: When you ask a question, specialized indexer agents identify relevant knowledge nodes across the entire Ethereum ecosystem, constructing a query-specific semantic network rather than simple keyword matching. 2. **Multi-stage Verification Pipeline**: Dedicated verification agents cross-validate every statement against multiple authoritative sources, confirming that each response element appears in multiple locations for triangulation before being accepted. 3. **Context Graph Pruning**: We've developed custom algorithms that recognize and eliminate contextually irrelevant information to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio, preventing the knowledge dilution problems plaguing traditional RAG systems. 4. **Temporal Code Understanding**: ByteBell tracks changes across all Ethereum implementations through time, understanding how functions have evolved across hard forks and protocol upgrades—differentiating between legacy, current, and testnet implementations. # Example: Ask ""How does EIP-4844 blob verification work?"" and you get the exact implementation in all execution clients, links to the specification, core dev discussions that influenced design decisions, and code examples from projects using blobs—all with precise line-by-line citations and references. # Try it yourself: [ethereum.bytebell.ai]( I deployed it for free for the Ethereum ecosystem because honestly, we all waste too much time hunting through GitHub repos and outdated Stack Overflow threads. The ZK ecosystem already has one at [zcash.bytebell.ai]( where developers report saving 5+ hours per week. # Technical differentiation: This isn't a simple AI chatbot—it's a specialized architecture designed specifically for technical knowledge domains. Every answer is backed by real sources with commit-level precision. ByteBell understands version differences, tracks changes across hard forks, and knows which EIPs are active on mainnet versus testnets. # Works everywhere: Web interface, Chrome extension, website widget, and integrates directly into Cursor and Claude Desktop \[MCP\] for seamless development workflows. # The cutting edge: The other ecosystems are moving fast on developer experience. Polkadot just funded this through a Web3 Foundation grant. Base and Optimism teams are exploring implementation. Ethereum should have the best developer tooling, Please reach out to use if you are in Ethrem foundation. DMs are open or reach to on twitter [ # Anti-hallucination technology: We've achieved <2% hallucination rates (compared to 45%+ in general LLMs) through our multi-agent verification architecture. Each response must pass through multiple parallel validation pipelines: 1. **Source Retrieval**: Specialized agents extract relevant code snippets and documentation 2. **Metadata Extraction**: Dedicated agents analyze metadata for versioning and compatibility 3. **Context Window Management**: Agents continuously prune retrieved information to prevent context rot 4. **Source Verification**: Validation agents confirm that each cited source actually exists and contains the referenced information 5. **Consistency Check**: Cross-referencing agents ensure all sources align before generating a response This approach costs significantly more than standard LLM implementations, but delivers unmatched accuracy in technical domains. While big companies focus on growth and ""good enough"" results, we've optimized for precision first, building a system developers can actually trust for mission-critical work. Anyway, go try it. Break it if you can. Tell me what's missing. This is for the community, so feedback actually matters. [ethereum.bytebell.ai]( Please try it. The models have actually become really good at following prompts as compared to one year back when we were working on Local AI [ We made all that code open sourced and written in Rust as well as Python but had to abandon it because access to Apple M machines with more than 16 GB of RAM was rare and smaller models under 32B are not so good at generating answers and their quantized versions are even less accurate. Everybody is writing code using Cursor, Windsurf, and OpenAI. You can't stop them. Humans are bound to use the shortest possible path to money; it's human nature. Imagine these developers now have to understand how blockchain works, how cryptography works, how Solidity works, how EVM works, how transactions work, how gas prices work, how zk works, read about 500+ blogs and 80+ blogs by Vitalik, how Rust or Go works to edit code of EVM, and how different standards work. We have just automated all this. We are adding the functionality to generate tutorials on the fly. We are also working on generating the full detailed map of GitHub repositories. This will make a huge difference. **If someonw has told you that ""Multi agents framework with Customised Prompts and SLMs/LLMs"" will not work, Please read these papers.** **Early MAS research**: Multi-agent systems emerged as a distinct field of AI research in the 1980s and 1990s, with works like Gerhard Weiss's 1999 book, Multiagent Systems, A Modern Approach to Distributed Artificial Intelligence. This research established that complex problems could be solved by multiple, interacting agents. **The Condorcet Jury Theorem**: This classic theoretical result in social choice theory demonstrates that if each participant has a better-than-random chance of being correct, a majority vote among them will result in near-perfect accuracy as the number of participants grows. It provides a mathematical basis for why aggregating multiple agents' answers can improve the overall result. **An Age old method to get the best results, If you go to Kaggle majority of them use Ensemble method. Ensemble learning:** In machine learning, ensemble methods have long used the principle of aggregating the predictions of multiple models to achieve a more accurate final prediction. A 2025 Medium article by Hardik Rathod describes ""demonstration ensembling,"" where multiple few-shot prompts with different examples are used to aggregate responses. **The Autogen paper:** The open-source framework AutoGen, developed by Microsoft, has been used in many papers and demonstrations of multi-agent collaboration. The paper AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation Framework (2023) is a core text describing the architecture. **Improving LLM Reasoning with Multi-Agent Tree-of-Thought and Thought Validation (2024)**: This paper proposes a multi-agent reasoning framework that integrates the Tree-of-Thought (ToT) strategy. It uses multiple ""Reasoner"" agents that explore different reasoning paths in parallel. A separate ""Thought Validator"" agent then validates these paths, and a consensus-based voting mechanism is used to determine the final answer, leading to increased reliability. **Anthropic's multi-agent research system:** In a 2025 engineering blog post, Anthropic detailed its internal multi-agent research system. The system uses a ""LeadResearcher"" agent to create specialized sub-agents for different aspects of a query, which then work in parallel to gather information.",2025-10-24 22:18:25,graphicaldot,post,ethereum,,Reddit

p_1oikcnv,"Solana ETF goes on move… but the vibes feel different than past “first day” crypto moments Maybe it’s just me, but BSOL’s first day didn’t feel like a cultural event the way early BTC or even ETH ETF launches did. Volume was solid, flows look promising, and GSOL’s conversion tomorrow adds heft. Yet the noise level is… muted. No meme tsunami, fewer victory laps, more “cool, noted” from the timeline. That’s not necessarily bad. In 2021, retail FOMO plus social hype were jet fuel… and whipsaw risk. Today’s setup is more methodical. Institutions can now get SOL through a ’33 Act wrapper on the NYSE… Bitwise priced it at 0.20% with a temporary fee waiver and even included staking… the fee war is very real. It’s efficient, but also kind of sterile. The adoption many of us wanted… just delivered in a suit and tie. Context matters too. Attention is fragmented. FinTwit is busy with AI mega-caps and macro. And psychology plays a role: a new SOL ETF is big for the ecosystem, but it doesn’t hit like “the first ever spot BTC ETF.” Once the category exists, follow…ons feel incremental… even if they move real capital over quarters. The bull case is straightforward: if BTC and ETH are the “core,” SOL can become the “growth” leg for multi…asset mandates. If flows compound… if tracking stays tight… if distribution widens beyond day…one curiosity… $3B over 12…18 months isn’t crazy. The bear (or at least sober) case: early volume ≠ durable demand, and crypto ETP flows can be lumpy. Without persistent creations, spreads widen and enthusiasm fades. Small note on the rest of the day’s launches… Canary’s Hedera and Litecoin ETFs listed on Nasdaq and are much smaller, so flows will probably be lighter than SOL. One interesting angle here… as more traditional investors gain exposure through ETFs, the tax side of crypto investing is about to get more layered. Swaps, staking rewards, conversions, and even ETF-based gains all feed into taxable events in different ways. It’s a good reminder that if you’re already balancing on-chain trades with new ETF exposure, tools like Awaken tax make life a lot easier by syncing wallets and exchange data automatically so you don’t end up sorting hundreds of transactions at year end. My read: this is a legitimacy step, not a confetti cannon. The question isn’t “did it pop today?” It’s “does it keep showing up on statements for the next six earnings calls?” Anyone else feeling that shift… from hype cycles to slow, boring normalization?",2025-10-28 21:23:24,Gullible-Tale9114,post,solana,,Reddit
p_1ohrg1x,"spot SOL ETFs coming very soon If not for the government shutdown, the spot SOL ETFs (with staking) would already have been approved. When will they be available to trade in the U.S.? Nobody knows for sure. Hopefully, this will cause SOL to go way up and at least double in the next several months, from 200 to 400+. Personally, I recently got the 2X SOL ETF called SOLT which is already available, and if SOL doubles to 400 or more (which is my belief), then this 2X SOL ETF should do EVEN BETTER and may go from 20 to about 80. This is what came up on a google search: It is possible that some spot Solana (SOL) ETFs could be available to trade in the U.S. tomorrow, October 28, 2025. Some exchanges appear to be moving forward with listings despite the ongoing government shutdown. However, the U.S. government shutdown has created uncertainty regarding the official launch date, as final Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval is delayed for many applicants. Key details * **NYSE listings:** On Monday, October 27, 2025, the New York Stock Exchange posted listing notices for several spot crypto ETFs, including the Bitwise Solana Fund and the Grayscale Solana Trust. * **Bitwise Solana Staking ETF:** This fund received certification from NYSE Arca on Monday, October 27, with trading potentially beginning as soon as Tuesday, October 28. * **Government shutdown:** The SEC has not been able to process all of the necessary S-1 filings due to the shutdown, which complicates the launch for most applicants. * **21Shares ETF:** The 21Shares Solana ETF has already been registered on the Cboe BZX Exchange, having received provisional approval from the SEC. However, its final trading review was on hold due to the government shutdown. * **Other applicants:** Firms like Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, CoinShares, and VanEck have also filed applications and are awaiting regulatory action. Important context While some funds might start trading, the situation is complex due to the government shutdown impacting official SEC procedures.

p_1ohlzfh,"$19B Liquidated, Zero Failures: A Protocol-by-Protocol Breakdown October 11th, 2025 marked DeFi’s **most severe stress test to date.** What many thought to be the next leg up quickly turned into the largest Black Swan event in crypto history. In a matter of hours, a cascade of liquidations tore through decentralized markets on all chains. Over **$19 billion in collateral** was wiped out as asset prices plunged, gas fees spiked, and oracle wicks widened the pain. Borrowers saw vaults erased, lenders saw yields evaporate, and stability mechanisms were tested across every major lending protocol. Billions were liquidated, but not all losses were equal. Individual protocols have different means of protection against crises such as this one. Depending on where you were trading, the same position would have ended up with a different outcome. I’ve gathered three of the most prominent DeFi protocols to see who combatted this price action most effectively, and how their users faired: # 1. Drift I wanted to start with Drift because they have a unique approach to activating liquidation thresholds. A total of $76 million was wiped out on Drift alone, but the platform incurred **zero** bad debt. This was primarily thanks to four main features : # 1. Oracle Price, not Mark Price Many speculate this is where Binance went wrong last week. Mark Price is a method of calculating the price of assets internally derived from oracle pricing, but factoring in other considerations.This can be a slippery slope and cause widespread depegging; precisely what users of Binance experienced. Drift stays away from this, and goes even further than solely using oracle price to prove extra layers of security to traders on their platform. # 2. 5 Minute TWAP Drift liquidates based on a 5 Minute Time-Weighted Average price. Out of the 4,608 users at risk on their platform, almost half (2,303) were saved by these guardrails. Liquidations are blocked based on a 50% divergence between the oracle price and the oracle’s 5 minute TWAP (thank you Chris Pheaney). # 3. Partial Liquidations All it takes is one unfavorable wick to entirely wipe out your position. At least, that’s how it usually goes. On Drift, liquidations are done on a slightly larger time frame, 10 seconds was given as an example, to give time for price stabilization. Another method of combatting god candles in the wrong direction. # 4. Drift’s Insurance Fund/AMM When all else fails and bad debt starts to build, Drift has a robust USDC Insurance Fund to cover any losses. It’s sourced by both protocol revenue and external stakers. Those who deposited into the Insurance Fund made 600K from this event alone. Not to mention, Drift currently has the highest OI - Volume Ratio post-dump, so it seems users are relatively satisfied with their performance this past weekend. All in all, no socialized losses were incurred across all of their perp users, and if they had been, they would be spread out pro-rata ( @cindyleowtt). No downtime, no user losses, I am impressed to say the least. ([@tracybbd ]( )]( # 2. Kamino 8,103 liquidations spread across 1,671 wallets. Coincidentally, Kamino improved their liquidation engine barely over a month before all of this happened. Unlike other major DeFi protocols, Kamino doesn’t offer an insurance protocol, but still is able to boast an incredible $0 bad debt accrued. Here’s what’s helped them maintain that: 1. **Auto-deleveraging** When an asset's supply or borrow amount is considered too risky, K-Lend’s auto-deleveraging mechanism kicks in automatically. Partial liquidations now occur in 10% increments preventing your entire position from being wiped out at once. Additionally, penalties for liquidation are as low as 0.1% as of early September. This is 10x better than they performed before. [ (video from Kamino as graphic showing partial unwinding) # 2. Dynamic Interest Rates With a poly-linear interest rate curve, Kamino’s constantly changing interest rates keep things stable by encouraging: * lenders to supply into the market * borrowers to repay debt By implementing this, users are encouraged to actively monitor their positions; thus, be aware of large liquidation events occurring. # 3. Kamino’s Risk Council During extreme events, Kamino’s core team works alongside DeFi industry leaders such as SteakhouseFi and Re7 Labs to safeguard the platform. They have the power to manually deleverage,, unwind positions, and more when deemed necessary. It’s an added layer of comfort to an already heavily audited and secure protocol. Since launching in 2023, they have retained **zero** bad debt through $140M + in liquidations with no insurance fund needed. They continue to bring new innovations to how they perform liquidations when necessary, and have the second highest TVL out of protocols on Solana for a reason. If you’d like a more in-depth breakdown of Kamino during this timeframe, I thank AllezLabs put together a substantial summary and providing us with plenty of insightful data. ([ # 3. Hyperliquid The behemoth of all perps platforms, Hyperliquid, was put to the test with this being their first Black Swan event since inception. Maintaining billions of perps volume on the daily over the last few months; they took the blunt of liquidations suffer # HLP Vault The Hyperliquid Liquidity Provider vault, or HLP for short, provides liquidity to the orderbooks and makes market-making possible on Hyperliquid. ( thanks CEO Jeff ). For the first time in over two years, the HLP failed, and Hyperliquids’ Cross-margin Auto-deleveraging system kicked in. For those who might be unfamiliar with this mechanism, it works like this: 1. User’s position/account falls below the required maintenance margin and is now undercollateralized (in this case, due to a sharp drop in prices form the oracle) 2. A liquidation is triggered and sent to the orderbooks to buy/sell at market price 3. Due to extreme volatility, the orderbooks are slammed and the position cant be fully exited 4. The HLP (Hyperliquidity-Provider) vault assumes ownership of the remaining collateral to exit the position once some time has passed and things have stabilized 5. If the HLP liquidation backstop is not enough, ADL begins to kick in. # Cross Margin ADL As you know now, a lot has to happen to get to this point. Once there, users are given a rank, and those with the highest unrealized PNL and larger leverage are put on the chopping block first. They begin to have their positions automatically deleveraged to cover any outstanding bad debt. This is when people took to CT to let their complaints be heard, but the stats don't lie: * <20 mins for HLP to liquidate billions of $ * 100% uptime * No bad debt Hyperliquid operated exactly as intended, and showed us why it’s number one in the perps space across all chains. # A Win For DeFi Across the board, DeFi is stepping up. Loopscale maintained zero bad debt. Projec Zero protected 100% of user solvency across 2,000+ liquidations—only $1.8M liquidated thanks to partial liquidations that bring users back to health instead of wiping them out entirely. Orca held the line when other proprietary AMMs pulled liquidity and left users stranded. [ Had this happened three years ago—hell, even two—we would've seen protocol insolvencies, immense socialized losses, and cascading failures across the ecosystem. Instead, we saw transparent liquidation engines, robust insurance mechanisms, and oracle systems that held under pressure. On October 11th, CEXs went down, their trust went with it, and DeFi didn't even flinch. This is the real-world proof of what DeFi offers and TradFi can't. But this is just the beginning. The value prop is there—now imagine where it's going. Automation, agents, the possibilities are truly endless. 24/7 position monitoring, pre-liquidation rebalancing, cross-protocol optimization in milliseconds. If DeFi can survive this stress test with manual infrastructure, what happens when agentic workflows take over? The foundation is set. Automation is coming. TradFi has no choice but to take notice.",2025-10-27 19:14:20,SolanaDeFi,post,solana,,Reddit

Knowledge is the real flex here. 1) Quantified Network Value: Solana generates an estimated $5 Billion in annualized transaction fees, a metric comparable to major centralized payment networks. Its DeFi platform facilitate $1.2 Trillion in trading volume YTD. 2) Institutional Confidentiality Bridge: Solana is emerging as a ""ZK powerhouse"", integrating Zero-Knowledge technology to enable crucial, confidential computations and private DeFi transactions. 3) The Strategic Imperative: This ZK integration bridges the platform's unparalleled performance with the necessary confidentiality required by institutional actors for large-scale, proprietary trading and financial operations. Solana's economic activity is validated. Does this strong fundamental utility override concerns, or is the long-term investment justified only if the ZK privacy roadmap successfully implements perfect institutional-grade confidentiality?",2025-10-24 10:54:26,Narrow_Chance7639,post,solana,,Reddit

p_1ogdq7j,"Solana's Final Hurdle: Why FHE is the Only Way to Unlock True Institutional Confidentiality. Institutional validation for Solana is clear: Fidelity is integrating trading, validating the infrastructure. But the core barrier for large-scale adoption remains confidentiality. The true growth is now constrained by cryptography, not speed. The core conviction is that FHE is the strategic imperative that turns Solana into a compliant venue for proprietary trading. 1) Throughput vs. Privacy Conflict: Solana recorded $326 Billion in Q3 DEX volume, confirming its capacity for high-velocity activity. However, traditional public blockchain transparency is unsuitable for proprietary financial operations. 2) The FHE Solution: Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows data to be processed on-chain while remaining encrypted. Zama's FHEVM is the protocol enabling this for confidential smart contracts. 3) The Scalability Roadmap: The historical barrier is breaking. The FHE roadmap targets 10,000+ TPS per chain via specialized ASICs. This is the necessary capacity to confidently bring global payments and high-volume institutional activity confidentially on-chain. Institutional integration is inevitable. Is the investment strategy now focused on accumulating SOL based on the $500 target and current DEX volume, or is the strategic necessity to fund the specialized FHE hardware roadmap to solve the confidentiality problem?",2025-10-26 07:42:22,Narrow_Chance7639,post,solana,,Reddit

p_1oil6xd,"Polygon has supported this subreddit a lot and I'm insanely bullish - A deep dive on what Polygon has been up to The Messari Q3 report on Polygon (here: [ is the strongest confirmation yet that the network has regained momentum. For the first time in several years, the story, the data, and the execution all align. POL’s market capitalization grew 39.2% quarter over quarter to $2.36 billion dollars, outperforming the broader crypto market, which rose by 20%. Network activity, institutional participation, and technical upgrades all moved forward in sync. What excites me most about this report is that it validates what many of us who follow Polygon closely have been sensing. After a few years of searching for direction, Polygon has rediscovered its identity and is executing with focus. The growth across payments, real-world assets, and interoperability shows a network building for real adoption rather than temporary hype. History Lesson - Polygon was one of the most prominent blockchains during 2021 and 2022. Back then, MATIC was a household name in crypto. DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and gaming applications all flocked to Polygon. It was fast, cheap, and part of Ethereum’s scaling future. Then the market cooled, prices dropped, and Polygon’s identity blurred. It continued shipping technology, but the narrative was less defined. The ecosystem became large, but scattered, and the token’s performance reflected that uncertainty. In 2025, that changed. Polygon refocused around two themes with real-world traction: payments and real-world assets. This focus unified its ecosystem under one clear goal of building the financial and transactional backbone for onchain economies. The Messari data shows that this strategy is working. Stablecoin growth, institutional partnerships, and infrastructure upgrades are moving together. The chain has a strong foundation and a clear direction. The 39% market-cap surge in Q3 is the first tangible signal that the market recognizes that turnaround. To me, it feels like the beginning of Polygon’s second act. The market performance in Q3 represents renewed confidence in execution. POL now ranks as the second-largest Ethereum Layer 2 token by market capitalization, behind Mantle and ahead of Arbitrum, Optimism, and Immutable. More than 99% of the supply has transitioned from MATIC to POL, completing one of the largest token migrations in the industry. Polygon’s outperformance is supported by onchain metrics. Daily active addresses increased by 13%, daily transactions rose 20%, and the average transaction fee declined by 23% in POL terms. These metrics indicate expanding usage and improving efficiency at the same time. When I look at these numbers, I see a market beginning to price real fundamentals again. The price action is following execution, which is what sustainable growth looks like. Polygon’s payments ecosystem is one of the strongest indicators of real adoption. In Q3, stablecoin supply increased 22% to $2.94 billion. USDT alone grew 35% to $1.4B, while USDC maintained close to $1B. More importantly, those stablecoins are being used. Payments-focused applications on Polygon facilitated $1.82B in transaction volume across more than 50 platforms during the quarter, up 49% from Q2. Polygon has also become a hub for innovative payments infrastructure. What excites me most about this growth is that it represents genuine economic activity. They are transfers, purchases, and settlements happening on a scalable blockchain that costs a fraction of a cent per transaction. This is what a functional onchain payments network looks like. If payments show real consumer traction, real-world assets show that institutions are taking Polygon seriously. The total value of tokenized RWAs on Polygon reached $1.14B (recently grew to $1.6B last week) by the end of Q3. The issuers include government agencies, state banks, and regulated financial entities. Germany’s NRW Bank issued a 100 million euro bond on Polygon under electronic securities law. Spain’s BeToken launched one of Europe’s first fully regulated equity token offerings. The Philippines Department of Budget and Management implemented a blockchain-based system to track public funds, improving transparency in government spending. Justoken launched tokens backed by physical commodities such as soybeans and soybean oil, with a combined value of over $450M. These projects mark a shift from experimentation to production. Institutions are using Polygon for financial instruments that carry legal and regulatory weight. This is the kind of adoption that builds long-term credibility. When state banks and government agencies issue assets on a public chain, it changes the perception of blockchain entirely. For me, this is one of the most exciting parts of the Polygon story in 2025. Real capital is entering the ecosystem, and it is doing so on Polygon because of its reliability, low cost, and Ethereum alignment. While institutional adoption is accelerating, developer momentum has been equally strong. Polygon ranks fourth in global blockchain developer interest in 2025, behind Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. This shows that the ecosystem continues to attract new builders even as competition increases. The Agglayer Incubator Program has become a central piece of this growth. The Agglayer connects multiple chains into a unified liquidity network, creating an environment where assets and users move seamlessly between ecosystems. Several breakout projects have emerged from this initiative. Katana, a DeFi-optimized Layer 2 chain, launched earlier this year with deep liquidity and sustainable yield mechanisms. Miden continues to advance zero-knowledge virtual machine research. Billions focuses on institutional DeFi infrastructure, while other projects explore areas such as onchain identity and privacy. This expanding network of independent but interoperable chains is what sets Polygon apart in 2025. It is not competing to be a single chain; it is building an interconnected ecosystem under the Agglayer framework. Polygon’s resurgence is also visible in its community engagement. **On October 1, 2025, Polygon became the first blockchain to formally sponsor and participate in** r/CryptoCurrency **as a Community Sponsor.** They are officially a sponsor of this subreddit and have distributed $5000 in POL rewards to users of the sub. According to Surf AI’s (another AMA participant) sentiment analysis, Polygon leads all Layer 2 solutions in positive Reddit discussions, with 78 percent bullish mentions compared to 62 percent for competitors. This shows that sentiment around Polygon has turned positive again as users see progress across the ecosystem. The renewed focus on education and open communication reflects Polygon’s effort to focusing meaningfully in crypto communities and cultures. I view this community alignment as a strong sign of maturity. Several major developments this quarter have strengthened Polygon’s position further. * **Institutional Staking:** AMINA Bank launched regulated POL staking on October 9, 2025, offering compliant yield opportunities for institutional investors. This could unlock large amounts of capital from entities that have been waiting for regulatory clarity. * **Polymarket Expansion:** Polymarket, one of the most active applications on Polygon, saw its trading volume increase tenfold year over year in 2025. It now represents a significant share of Polygon’s DeFi activity and recently completed a $2B raise at a $9B valuation. * **Developer and Institutional Leadership:** Polygon continues to attract developers and enterprises alike through programs such as the Agglayer Incubator. * **Vitalik Buterin’s Endorsement:** In mid-October 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin publicly praised Polygon’s contributions to Ethereum scalability and its early leadership in zero-knowledge research. One of the most exciting developments this week is Polygon Labs’ collaboration with Manifold Trading, a quantitative investment firm specializing in institutional-grade liquidity. This partnership represents a major leap toward professional market standards in decentralized finance. Manifold will bring data-driven liquidity management, quantitative market-making, and tighter spreads to Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem. In traditional markets, firms like Manifold ensure smooth execution and consistent pricing across venues. That structure has largely been missing in DeFi, where liquidity often sits idle or fragmented across decentralized exchanges. By applying institutional execution practices to onchain markets, Polygon and Manifold are building a system that offers predictable depth and lower slippage. For context, compressing the spread on a one-million-dollar trade from 50 basis points to 5 basis points can save more than 4,000 dollars in execution costs. Scaled across billions in trading volume, these efficiencies make DeFi truly investable at institutional scale. Manifold’s strategies will operate across Polygon’s major decentralized exchanges to harmonize pricing and ensure new markets launch with meaningful depth from day one. For fintechs and neobanks exploring onchain payments or tokenized asset trading, the benefits are immediate. Polygon’s network can now deliver the execution quality and stability of traditional financial systems while maintaining the transparency and openness of DeFi. This is a direct extension of the vision Polygon has been building toward all year. With infrastructure capable of 5,000-plus transactions per second, sub-five-second finality, and unified cross-chain liquidity through the Agglayer, the network is becoming a full-stack solution for global payments and institutional finance. The Manifold partnership makes that vision tangible by turning liquidity itself into an institutional-grade product. Polygon’s infrastructure progress has been equally important. The Bhilai Hardfork, Heimdall v2, and Rio Testnet upgrades have all delivered major performance improvements. The Bhilai Hardfork increased throughput to over 1,000 transactions per second, raised the block gas limit, and implemented account abstraction through EIP-7702. Heimdall v2 reduced transaction finality from one to two minutes down to approximately five seconds by upgrading the consensus layer. The Rio Testnet, which is moving toward mainnet, introduces stateless verification and validator redesigns that could enable up to 5,000 transactions per second. Polygon also launched Agglayer CDK Enterprise, a toolkit that allows institutions to deploy privacy-enabled EVM chains that remain interoperable with the main ecosystem. This combination of scalability, privacy, and interoperability is a major step toward institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure. Average transaction fees have dropped to roughly 0.0027 dollars, making Polygon one of the most efficient networks in the space. For payments and RWAs, those economics are critical. Polygon’s 2025 story is one of renewal. The network has moved from a period of uncertainty to a position of clear strength. Its focus on payments, real-world assets, and interoperability has created measurable growth across both retail and institutional segments. The community is re-engaged, the developer base is expanding, and institutions are beginning to trust Polygon for real financial applications. The Messari report captures this turning point with data, but the larger narrative is about execution and focus. The 39% rise in market capitalization in Q3 is, in my view, only an early indication of what lies ahead. Polygon has rebuilt its foundation, aligned its strategy with real demand, and positioned itself at the center of Ethereum’s scaling ecosystem. If the current trajectory continues, Polygon could become one of the most important networks in the next phase of blockchain adoption.",2025-10-28 21:55:11,002_timmy,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit
p_1oikeeb,"Solana ETF goes live… but the vibes feel different than past “first day” crypto moments Maybe it’s just me, but BSOL’s first day didn’t feel like a cultural event the way early BTC or even ETH ETF launches did. Volume was solid, flows look promising, and GSOL’s conversion tomorrow adds heft. Yet the noise level is… muted. No meme tsunami, fewer victory laps, more “cool, noted” from the timeline. That’s not necessarily bad. In 2021, retail FOMO plus social hype were jet fuel… and whipsaw risk. Today’s setup is more methodical. Institutions can now get SOL through a ’33 Act wrapper on the NYSE… Bitwise priced it at 0.20% with a temporary fee waiver and even included staking… the fee war is very real. It’s efficient, but also kind of sterile. The adoption many of us wanted… just delivered in a suit and tie. Context matters too. Attention is fragmented. FinTwit is busy with AI mega-caps and macro. And psychology plays a role: a new SOL ETF is big for the ecosystem, but it doesn’t hit like “the first ever spot BTC ETF.” Once the category exists, follow…ons feel incremental… even if they move real capital over quarters. The bull case is straightforward: if BTC and ETH are the “core,” SOL can become the “growth” leg for multi…asset mandates. If flows compound… if tracking stays tight… if distribution widens beyond day…one curiosity… $3B over 12…18 months isn’t crazy. The bear (or at least sober) case: early volume ≠ durable demand, and crypto ETP flows can be lumpy. Without persistent creations, spreads widen and enthusiasm fades. One interesting angle here… as more traditional investors gain exposure through ETFs, the tax side of crypto investing is about to get more layered. Swaps, staking rewards, conversions, and even ETF-based gains all feed into taxable events in different ways. It’s a good reminder that if you’re already balancing on-chain trades with new ETF exposure, tools like Awaken tax make life a lot easier by syncing wallets and exchange data automatically so you don’t end up sorting hundreds of transactions at year end. My read: this is a legitimacy step, not a confetti cannon. The question isn’t “did it pop today?” It’s “does it keep showing up on statements for the next six earnings calls?” Anyone else feeling that shift… from hype cycles to slow, boring normalization?",2025-10-28 21:25:08,Gullible-Tale9114,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit
p_1oijw6o,"A Nasdaq-listed company plans to move $200M of ETH onto an Ethereum L2 Blockchain (Linea) and restake it through etherfi / EigenLayer infrastructure. This is a shift from ""holding ETH as an asset"" to ""treating ETH as productive security collateral"" SharpLink Gaming (Nasdaq: SBET) announced plans to allocate roughly $200 million of its ETH treasury onto Linea, an Ethereum L2 blockchain developed by Consensys. The ETH will be staked and restaked through etherfi and EigenLayer-based infrastructure such as EigenCloud, with Anchorage Digital providing regulated custody. This marks a shift from passive holding to active participation in Ethereum’s security economy. Instead of letting ETH sit on the balance sheet, SharpLink is locking it into validator and restaking contracts—earning yield while contributing to network security. Restaking, in this context, allows the same ETH collateral that secures Ethereum to also secure external protocols. These can include oracle networks, data-availability layers, or systems like ""verifiable AI"" that rely on cryptographic guarantees. In effect, ETH becomes programmable collateral: similar to gold, but capable of being configured to act as security capital for any protocol, to underwrite its digital infrastructure. Routing the deployment through Linea highlights how Ethereum’s scaling stack is maturing, and is no longer just a developer sandbox. Corporate treasuries can now interact with Ethereum's cryptoeconomic protocols. The broader significance is structural: if more institutions treat ETH as productive security collateral, Ethereum evolves from a transaction platform into a base layer of economic trust whose security can be rented by other protocols. SharpLink’s move is very promising for that reason.",2025-10-28 21:06:03,aminok,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

p_1oibkb0,"I have seen a lot of “if you pay crypto taxes you’re a moron.” ok champ… let’s talk crypto isn’t untraceable. most networks are public ledgers and your wallet history lives there forever. the name might not be on the address, but one kyc deposit or withdrawal ties the real you to that trail. on-ramps do kyc, agencies use blockchain analytics, and once a single touchpoint is linked, a lot of the rest can be inferred. why people still get caught is boring and simple. exchanges file reports and answer lawful requests. banks flag big cash outs. your on-chain life leaves loud breadcrumbs… nfts, staking rewards, bridge receipts, lp tokens, all of it. then the mismatch letters show up because you sold on exchange a, didn’t file anything, and the agency already has the data. easy pickings. what actually gets taxed depends on your country, but the usual story is the same. selling for fiat, swapping coin a for coin b, or spending crypto counts as a disposal. staking, mining, airdrops, yield, referral payouts, all usually hit as income at fair market value when you receive them. nft flips are typically capital gains. stablecoin interest is usually ordinary income. and if your records vanished with a dead exchange, it’s still on you to reconstruct cost basis. the faceplants are also predictable. a 1099 or local equivalent isn’t “profit,” it’s gross proceeds or rewards. you still need cost basis to get to real gains or losses. people ignore coin to coin trades. they treat defi like a black box when swaps, providing and pulling liquidity, and wrapping can all be taxable events. privacy coins or mixers add privacy, they don’t grant legal immunity. and losing your seed phrase often means losing your paper trail too. there’s a simple way to stay clean without losing your mind. list every venue you touched and pull the data early… csvs from exchanges, full on chain history for your addresses. rebuild cost basis using your jurisdiction’s rules like fifo or specific id. tag income correctly at value on receipt. mark self transfers so they don’t look like sales. reconcile year end balances to what your ledger says. save everything… tx hashes, screenshots, csvs… in a folder per tax year. tools help here..you can use a tool for that I personally use awaken to match on chain lots to exchange reports so my numbers aren’t vibes as it saves me a lot of time… use whatever you trust, just don’t wing it. if you messed up, amend sooner not later. if your setup is complex, a crypto literate tax pro is worth it. you can still care about privacy the legal way. use fresh addresses for new contexts and avoid reusing receive addresses. self-custody is fine, just keep meticulous records. think twice about doxxing wallets with public usernames. if you touch privacy tools, know your local rules before you do. The bottom line is…you can be pro-privacy and still pro-compliance. the chain is more transparent than people think and the tax machine is more automated than it used to be. if you like sleeping at night, treat crypto like any other investment or income stream… track it, report it, move on with your life. not tax or legal advice… rules vary by country… talk to a professional for your specifics.",2025-10-28 15:54:59,hodorrny,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

Here are some of the key findings from our latest report: * Since 2014, 44% of all processed crypto payments have been made in Bitcoin. * It remains the #1 payment method in 2025, accounting for 22.7% of all transactions this year, followed by USDT (19.8%), LTC (14%) and USDC (11.5%). * During the 2022 bear market, BTC payment volume still grew by +41.7%, proving that adoption doesn’t stop when the price dips. * Between 2018-2025, 6% of all BTC payments were processed through the Lightning Network layer. This year, LN makes up 11.7% of BTC transactions, enabling faster and cheaper checkouts. * Bitcoin is most often spent on web hosting, consumer services, and VPNs, industries where global access is most crucial. * The average order size is €132, ranging from microtransactions to large purchases like travel and tech. * More merchants are holding collected BTC (25.9%) from sales instead of converting it, the highest level since 2022.

p_1oi5oxi,"Post Quantum Panic - new research and accelerating timeline, in all likelyhood we have less tine than we thought The guy is a known expert. The talk is sufficiently laymen. It's worth paying attention to the accelerating timeline, his reasons for why NIST's deadline is too late, and his encouragement to stop acting dismissively. I liked his remark about IBM never having missed a deadline, and how he uses IBM's timeline as the most conservative estimate, which is ahead of NIST's deadline. IonQ timeline is way ahed of NIST's deadline. I also liked that he spelt it out: those acting dismissively have invariably never had any real understanding of quantum computing. In the meantime, keep buying Bitcoin. Crypto bros have traditionally dismissed it all and also claimed ""The world will have much bigger problems if RSA or ECC is cracked."" which is funny when you think about it, because out of all the big & high stake systems you could attack, a crypto network would likely be one of the first, simply because attacking other big & high stake systems has a higher risk of sending you to jail. In other words, the other big systems have an inherent higher level of protection. The problem of ""lost"" coins is a big one, as those aren't protected. People no longer in control of private keys (lost, dead, etc) will not be able to upgrade, so their coins will be available to crackers. Devs can theoretically block those addresses but that's a big pandora's box and I don't see it happening in Bitcoin as it would undermine the whole thesis of ""nobody controls Bitcoin"" (plus devs don't actually know if an address is dead). They possibly could add functionality to the chain such that a quantum private key derived from a classic key can unlock the funds, giving the true owner a bit of time to claim their coins before crackers get to it. Lost coins have no legislation protecting them. If you crack it, it's yours. Cracking equipment at first will only be available to QC manufacturers themselves, then big corps, then governments, before organized crime and smaller crime can afford/get their hands on it. Who wouldn't want Satoshi's stash? *P.S. Bitcoin MODs: you're hurting your own community, and your message to me says more about you. Banning me from r/Bitcoin for posting this video with ""you're obviously not here to learn about bitcoin"" is ironic, given the video is meant to help people learn.

The country has been ranked fifth most crypto-friendly globally in the 2025 Henley & Partners Crypto Wealth Report, citing its zero-tax regime for crypto trading and staking. On the AI side, a recent study by KPMG found that 97 per cent of UAE respondents say they have used AI for work, study or personal purposes... well ahead of the global average of 83 per cent. he next generation is clearly playing a stronger role: more than 67 per cent of UAE family offices report active or extensive involvement of successors in investment decision-making, a clear signal that multigenerational wealth is being shaped by emerging digital-first leadership. Top tier platforms like Bitget and others are already integrating Ai into crypto with the likes of GetAgent which helps users make better crypto decisions. they are also listing ai inclined tokens like COMMON, a project that's quietly building tools for communities to reward real participation. Standard Chartered’s regional head for EMEA and Global Head of South Asian Community, Vinay Gandhi, said: “Family offices in the UAE are embracing technology in a way that reflects both vision and discipline.

p_1ohjo95,"The $VULT Token Launch is Here — Redefining Self-Custody # What is Vultisig and Why It Matters Vultisig is the self-custody revolution. A next-generation wallet built on Multi-Party Computation (MPC) that eliminates every single point of failure. Your private keys never exist in one place, are never stored, and can never be leaked or phished. Multiple devices work together to approve transactions, creating a security model that is virtually unbreakable. It is designed for both individuals and institutions who demand control without compromise. Vultisig combines elite-grade security with simplicity and speed. Beyond secure storage, users can trade across multiple blockchains directly within the app. No exchange. No seed phrases. Just true, modular self-custody. # Recent Progress In the past year, Vultisig has evolved from a promising project into a global force. It expanded chain support to ZEC, TRON, DASH, and MANTLE, enhanced cross-chain swaps, launched a viral referral program, and reached one of its most anticipated milestones: the **Vultisig App Store.** Launching in Q4, the App Store introduces self-custodial automation modules like DCA, payroll, and copy trading, all built directly into the wallet. Every process stays on your device. No middlemen. No trust needed. Just programmable freedom. # Introducing the $VULT Token $VULT is more than a token. It is the fuel, the foundation, and the future of Vultisig’s ecosystem. It powers everything from trading fee discounts to governance and more. Holding $VULT means owning a piece of the infrastructure that is redefining how people hold their assets. As adoption grows, $VULT becomes the connective thread across every layer of the Vultisig network. Each swap, module, and automation flow strengthens the token’s utility and reinforces its position at the core of the movement. This is not a speculative launch. It is the ignition of a complete economic engine built on self-custody. # Launch Structure The $VULT launch follows a clear and transparent structure, built to reward early conviction and broad participation. **Whitelist Phase, 12pm UTC on 27th of October:** Reserved for early Vultisquad members with purchase caps to maintain fairness and accessibility. **Public Phase, 12pm UTC on 28th of October:** Opens 24 hours later, welcoming new entrants and allowing organic price discovery. **Exchange Listing:** $VULT will be listed on Kraken Exchange immediately on Public launch, bringing deep liquidity and global visibility to the movement. This structure eliminates gas wars and prevents manipulation, giving everyone a chance to enter on equal terms. # The Moment Vultisig is no longer just a wallet. It is a movement, a mindset, and now a fully realized ecosystem powered by $VULT. The crypto world is watching the rise of a new standard in self-custody. $VULT has already captured global attention, becoming the number one token by mindshare worldwide — and this is only the beginning. The era of seed phrases and centralized control is ending. The era of **Vultisig** has begun. Documents: CoinMarketCap: [ X: [",2025-10-27 17:49:40,Vultisig,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

p_1ohe5m6,"Hype trading or gambling memecoin won’t make you rich. With long term holding, you might have a chance For the ones who are just getting started with crypto, I have this advice… All these random memecoins and hype tokens aren't going to make you rich. I'll be blunt, it's basically gambling…unless you’re an insider or the creator of the token, the odds are against you. If you buy a coin, that means someone is selling it…that’s how the market balances out. When market crashes, it could be you holding the bag. If you look a little deeper, you’ll notice most of these meme and alt tokens run on the same blockchains and mirror the same price movements as the major coins. They’re driven almost entirely by hype and emotion, not real fundamentals. crypto as a whole clearly has a future. Decentralized technology will almost certainly reshape how global finance operates. tho I’m skeptical that any current crypto will be that global standard. However talking about the current environment. The current government administration has been openly pro-crypto, and as seen on Oct 10th we all know how easily market can be manipulated. When the president pardons exchange founders after they pay millions in lobbying fees, when his family launches crypto ventures and tokens pump right after policy announcements, that's not a healthy market..that's manipulation. so, if you actually wanna make money in this market, pick a solid coin with real fundamentals. Buy it and hold. Don’t try to trade every single pump. Most people entering now are going to have to wait for the next major leg up. Every market cycles. We saw a bull run in 2020, hit a top in 2021, we saw a bull run this year also, crashed on oct 10, and now we’re in a volatile phase heading into 2026. If you end up buying near the peak, just hold steady and wait for the next run. if you’re going to hold and occasionally rebalance, keep clean records so tax season doesn’t blindside you. i’ve been using awaken.tax to match on-chain lots with exchange reports and tag staking income so my 1099s and cost basis don’t turn into a mess. use whatever tool you trust… just don’t wing it. Holding long-term is the actual investment strategy. Hype trading and chasing memecoins is just gambling with extra steps.

p_1ogwp6f,"Can AI fix the human side of crypto governance? Bitcoin expert Jimmy Song recently outlined a problem that runs deeper than Bitcoin, one that affects almost every decentralized ecosystem today. Even in open systems, code often remains centralized. A small group of developers ends up steering direction, while millions of users have little to no real input. As Song puts it: When developers value different things than users, something has to give. Either you get new developers aligned with users, or users leave. This is less a technical issue and more a coordination one. How do you align large, global communities when human consensus doesn’t scale? Many projects have tried to solve this through voting based governance, but that approach has serious flaws: 1. Code proposals are too complex for most users to evaluate. 2. Voting doesn’t scale, who decides what gets voted on? 3.Hierarchies and political dynamics inevitably form. 4. Expression gets reduced to binary “yes/no” inputs that miss nuance. In short, even decentralized systems can fall into centralized coordination traps. Recently, some new approaches have started emerging. One of them from Tau Net, led by Ohad Asor takes a very different route. Instead of relying on voting, it uses a logical AI system that interprets what users mean (in computable language), maps out areas of agreement and conflict and then derives consensus automatically. Whether or not this specific model succeeds, it raises an important question. Can we build governance mechanisms that reflect what communities actually think and want without depending on hierarchy, politics, or mass voting? It feels like this might be the next frontier for crypto, solving the human side of decentralization. Is something like this the natural evolution of decentralized governance, or is true user-controlled consensus still a pipe dream?",2025-10-26 22:36:09,Omegacarlos1,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

The Multi-Chain Dream Is Evolving Into A Multi-Layer Ethereum Reality As you can see in the image above, the latest data from a16z, it shows something really interesting, 42% of the founders are building right now or planning to build on Ethereum and Base. That is more than every other chain combined. * Ethereum - 22% * Base - 20% * Solana - 16% * Bitcoin - 8% This is not just a stat, it is a clear signal of where the next wave of innovation is heading. Ethereum still plays for the long tame and they are trusting its foundation. The liquidity, the tooling and the dev culture are still unmatched. Then we have base, another success for Ethereum because it is a L2. Base supported by Coinbase is basically building a friendly on ramp into the Ethereum ecosystem in a fast, cheap and normie proof way. This is also attracting developers to work on it. Solana is not far away from them but in other aspects Solana is really far away from Ethereum ecosystem.

A new “payment account” could unlock direct Fed rail access for compliant firms. Ethereum’s DeFi dominance is set to soar, and altcoins? They’re not dead, they’re gearing up for a massive comeback. Fed Governor Waller declared a “new era” where DeFi isn’t the enemy, it’s a partner. Stablecoins, tokenization, and AI are now on the Fed‘s radar, with hands-on research to back it up. A proposed “payment account”, a capped, no frills master account for eligible firms. This means faster fiat, stablecoin swaps, smoother on/off-ramps, and tokenized payments on overdrive. Fed Rails Open Up a streamlined account (no interest, no overdrafts) could slash friction for DeFi players, making rails accessible to innovators. * AI + Payments: The Fed’s hyped on AI for fraud, risk, and routing, perfect for programmable L1s and L2s like Ethereum. * Ethereum’s Throne: With \~60% of DeFi’s TVL, ETH’s liquidity, tooling, and institutional heft make it the king of this shift. Altcoin Season Is Coming! The Fed’s pivot is a lifeline for altcoins, but don’t expect an overnight moon. This is a builder’s rally, not a meme coin pump. Smart contract L1s and L2s think Solana, ADA, Polygon, Avalanche, ... stand to gain as DeFi gets regulatory clarity and better rails. Stablecoin and tokenization projects (Chainlink, Polkadot, …) could thrive as tokenized assets scale. Be patient, altcoins need time to align with compliance, build infrastructure, and ride Ethereum’s coattails. The season’s brewing, and late 2025 or 2026 could be explosive for projects that play this right. Why Not Bitcoin? BTC’s a store of value, not a DeFi workhorse. This is about programmable chains and compliant infrastructure, Ethereum and altcoins are the real winners. The Fed isn’t just okay with DeFi, it’s inviting it to rebuild the payment system. This is the state saying, “Get on our rails, now!” Ethereum’s DeFi giants and scrappy altcoins are ready to seize this moment. What’s Next? This is exploration, not policy, hold the confetti. But the Fed’s moving fast, and DeFi’s in the driver’s seat. Watch Ethereum, compliant stablecoins, and altcoins building for the long game. Altcoin season is coming, the fuse is lit. Always be mindful that news can be overhyped. Invest wisely by DCA in during low risk and DCA out during high risk .

p_1of2rsn,"Can Logical AI Make Blockchain Governance Truly Adaptive? Most blockchains still depend on developer teams or token based voting, which often creates centralized control despite claims of decentralization. Governance changes usually require forks or off chain decisions that do not always reflect what participants actually want. A newer idea suggests using logical AI instead of generative AI to let networks adapt automatically. In this setup, participants describe their requirements in plain language, and the system’s reasoning engine identifies agreement and updates itself accordingly without human coded upgrades or voting rounds. I have noticed some projects like Tau Net as one of those projects experimenting with this model, which uses logical reasoning to convert participant input into executable rules, allowing the blockchain to evolve directly from user defined specifications rather than developer intervention. The system does not think but mechanically reasons, adjusting its structure based on shared intent. This idea raises key questions: would such automation reduce governance bias, or just shift control to the AI layer? Could it finally make decentralized systems genuinely participatory, or add new complexity under the surface?",2025-10-24 17:44:13,Sad-Struggle7797,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

p_1oeim8n,"Bitcoin Cycles & Fed Chair Timelines (no crystal ball) Bitcoin often topped within 2 months before Fed Chair end of term and, selloff into bear market a month after new Fed Chair or new term. That doesn’t cause the move but those windows come with policy headlines and shifting expectations, which markets react to. Timeline: Late 2013 to early 2014 (Bernanke step down Yellen start) * BTC cycle top: Dec 2013 ($1.2k). * Chair change: Jan 31, 2014 Bernanke ends, Feb 3, 2014 Yellen starts (2 months after the BTC cycle top). * What followed: a sharp monthly drop of 32% arrived in March 2014 (1 month after). Late 2017 to early 2018 (Yellen step down Powell start) * BTC cycle top: Dec 2017 ($19.7k). * Chair change: Feb 3 to 5, 2018 Yellen ends, Powell starts (2 months after the BTC cycle top). * What followed: another steep monthly selloff 33% in March 2018(1 month after). Late 2021 to mid 2022 (Powell term renewal) * BTC late cycle high: Nov 2021 (\~$69k). * Chair milestone: first term ended on Feb 5th 2022 (2.5 months); second term was delayed and confirmed on May 2022 (during the shift to rate hikes/QT). * What followed: the bear market accelerated into a 37% red candle June 2022( again 1 month after). Why the Fed Chair Matters for Bitcoin: The U.S. dollar dominates global finance, used in 88% of transactions and 59% of reserves, making the Fed’s monetary policy a key driver of Bitcoin’s price. The Fed controls liquidity via interest rates and QE/QT. Loose policy boosts risk assets like Bitcoin, tight policy suppresses them. Inflation fears also fuel Bitcoin’s “digital gold” appeal. The Fed Chair leads the FOMC, setting policy tone and expectations. A new Chair in 2026 could signal policy shifts, impacting Bitcoin’s volatility. While Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, its trading environment is fiat driven, tying its cycles to Fed actions. Future Outlook: Powell’s second term ends May 23, 2026. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could peak around Feb or March 2026 (2+ months prior), potentially followed by a bear market in June 2026, marked by a 30\~40% correction. However, external factors like regulation or global events could shift timelines. my risk metric isn’t flagging a hot zone (80-100) for Bitcoin this cycle yet, we might still have time.

At the same time, they claim that all assets are held on a 1:1 basis and that nothing is ever lent out. Maybe I’m misunderstanding this, but isn’t one of the main selling points of BTC the fact that you actually own it on the blockchain? That way, you can withdraw your BTC to your own wallet whenever you want, without worrying about what’s happening behind the scenes.

p_1oif2y8,"This paper on Bitcoin wealth and sovereignty got me thinking... Curious what others think about this framework. The full paper goes deeper into key management, asset protection, and governance. But this part in the abstract stood out to me: **Excerpt:** ""Bitcoin has established its superiority as a generational store of value. The concept of sovereignty must mature beyond unilateral control of cryptographic private keys to an upgraded, more complete form of sovereignty. Upgraded sovereignty contemplates using resilient, legally-recognized ownership regimes, and exploiting opportunities in favorable jurisdictions to achieve tax efficiency, asset protection, robust privacy, and inheritance preservation. An evolved approach to key management is not contrary to bitcoin’s value as a peer-to-peer medium of exchange. Rather, it’s a recognition that bitcoin’s superior design as a form of money gives it a tendency to rise indefinitely in terms of fiat currencies and as such, warrants thoughtful treatment and structure in societies governed by laws. Bitcoin remains a reliable medium of exchange for value in transactions over the internet and otherwise among users. But it also serves as an unmatched store of value as demand increases and as fiat debasement persists; “sats” go farther than they ever did before. So long as bitcoin is subject to the tax laws of various nations and until those who inherit large sums of value in wealth can reliably manage that wealth without risk of mismanagement or other permanent loss, holders of significant wealth in bitcoin must evolve their thinking when it comes to managing their holdings.""",2025-10-28 18:05:29,Low_Time_Preference,post,bitcoin,,Reddit

p_1oicdtk,"Leveraging BTC for loans instead of selling I've commented on a couple of threads and many people have PM'd me asking for details. So instead, I will share what I have learned so far here. I made many mistakes years ago - the same one others did. Sold some BTC when I thought ""hey, I made money, I'll sell some!"" (duh). I also did that stupid shit of thinking I could gain more by investing in crypto/shitcoins. Lessons learned...but here we are. My Wife and I want to do a kitchen remodel. We have no debt (other than house), and I am not a fan of living in debt. I researched HELOC, Personal loans, etc. Our credit is stellar so that wasn't an issue. But I kept running in to ""questionable"" things that I just didn't feel good about. Instead, I moved some BTC from cold storage to Coinbase and applied for their loan there (which is provided by Morpho). The APR they offered was 7.52% (but this changes, so you will want to keep an eye on it). The process was \*insanely\* easy and the money was in my account in seconds. I also figure out that if you keep a balance in USDC on Coinbase, it pays 4% APR, so I am doing that to offset the APR of the loan. I created a google sheet you all can use/copy to model your own scenario: [BTC Loan Calc]( In my case, BTC would have to fall to \~$60k for the loan to liquidate, and that assumes I made no payments on the loan. I also have enough liquid cash/btc that if I ""had to"" I could quickly pay the loan down so that it doesn't liquidate. So it's not a huge risk for me. Instead, this was more about ""how can I avoid paying taxes"" and instead **do what the 1% do and just leverage assets**. I've also added a section to the spreadsheet on ""What if I take the loan and use that to buy more BTC"". This may be a risk you are willing to take, but you need to closely watch the LTV and make sure you are making payments on the loan to keep the LTV down. Obligatory Disclaimer: Do your own research!

This is the core engine of our simulation. I then took the average returns of the bottom 50%, all the price paths and the top 10% price paths. This gives us a low, average and high expectation. These results can be seen in the table below. I think concluding you need to DCA : \- $1k per week to get there in 5 years \- $1.5k per week for 2-3 years \- $2.5k+ per week for 1 year Would be fair.

In my opinion, the future of Bitcoin puts us somewhere in the middle…many will adopt, and plenty never will. Why do I say this?

Gold has value as a pretty shiny rock (and yes some industrial use cases), but have I ever bought gold? A relative gave me a coin many years ago, and guess what I recently sold it for? Bitcoin. That’s been my only “gold exposure” my whole life from an investing perspective. Gold could double from here and go to $8000 per ounce, and you know what? I’m still not buying any, because it doesn’t interest me. Now perhaps I’m foolish and ignorant, and I’ll just “enjoy staying poor” from a gold investor’s perspective, but I really don’t care.

p_1ohyr9y,"Economy Is a Psychology Engine 🧠 Economy Is a Psychology Engine How Human Minds Drive Markets, Not Numbers At its core, the economy is not a machine of money — it’s a machine of minds. Prices, markets, booms, and crashes are not born from equations but from human emotions: hope, fear, trust, and desire. Every currency is a collective belief. Every transaction is an act of faith. When we say “the economy grows,” what we really mean is that people believe tomorrow will be better than today. When they lose that belief, recession begins — long before the numbers confirm it. Psychology is the engine; money is merely the fuel. Governments print money, but they cannot print trust. Central banks can raise interest rates, but they cannot raise confidence. This is why narrative matters more than policy. A nation’s economy rises when its people share a story of progress — that effort leads to reward, that innovation is worth the risk, that the future is open. Without that shared story, even abundant capital stagnates. The greatest economists are, in essence, psychologists who understand mass behavior. The greatest investors are storytellers who know how to align capital with conviction. So if you want to understand the economy, don’t just look at charts — look at people. Markets move not when data changes, but when minds do. --- Read more at:",2025-10-28 04:06:54,vhtech99,post,bitcoin,,Reddit

p_1ohxv9j,"The Point of No Return Some of you probably saw a post here the other day. Something like ""hyperbitcoinization happens when 1 BTC can buy a house"". It's a nice thought, but it's superficial. It's a comparison of prices, and prices are just noise. The real point of no return is not about price. It's about proof of work. It's the moment our civilization decides it is more important to expend the energy to create one new Bitcoin than it is to expend the energy to build one new house. To build a house, you need a certain amount of energy. You need energy to forge the steel, mix the concrete, cut the lumber, and power the tools that put it all together. This is the proof of work for a physical home. This cost is relatively stable. To create a Bitcoin, you need a certain amount of energy. You need electricity to power the ASICs that guess trillions of hashes per second. This is the PoW for absolutely scarce money. This cost is designed to do one thing: go up forever. Why? 2 reasons: 1, the difficulty adjustment means that as more people compete to mine, the work gets harder. And 2, the halving means that every 4 years, the reward for the same amount of work gets cut in half. The trajectory is set. The cost of building a house is a flat line. The cost of mining a Bitcoin is a line on an unstoppable, exponential ascent. These two lines are on a collision course. I don't know exactly when, since I don't know how to track global housing construction costs and global bitcoin mining costs. But I know it's very near. The ""point of no return"" is the moment those two lines cross. It's the moment that the real world energy cost to secure one new block on the chain becomes greater than the real world energy cost to build a new home for a family. When that day comes, it's not a matter of market sentiment or speculation. It is a fundamental, physical signal from the global economy. Like myself, construction workers won't be able to track the exact date, but the free market will tell them where to find work. There will be a lot more jobs in the bitcoin mining industry. Everything will slowly lead to the moment when market forces recognize that the most important thing we can build is not another physical structure, but another immutable block of truth on a new, incorruptible monetary network.

p_1ohrhk7,"My long term bull case for Bitcoin I've been seeing some posts on here underestimating the potential bull case for Bitcoin. The overwhelming majority of people are completely asleep right now, including many that are even in this space. Some people are thinking it can't go much higher, that it's a ponzi or that it will never hit 1 million $. I'm going to break down some of the major variables at play. Supply- We all know about the 21 million that will ever be mined. Right now, we are sitting at just under 20 million coins total, 19.94 million as I'm writing this. Out of this number, 3-4 million have been permanently lost. People now are buying and holding this asset with a longer term view and this will stay off the market, whereas in past cycles people were treating BTC as a swing trade. After the 2032 halving, the new supply to the market will be very low and from there will rapidly turn into barely more than a trickle with the halvings in decades after. Demand- This is where there are so many different variables at play that people do not fully understand. As I'm writing this, the market cap of Bitcoin is sitting a little under 2.3 trillion USD. The question some have is how does Bitcoin do a 10x or a 100x from here potentially. While this isn't realistic in the shorter term, given enough time the potential is insane. Global net worth- A simple google search shows that in 2024 GNW hit 470 trillion, we'll just say 450-500 trillion. In 2024 that net worth that increased approximately 4.6%. From 2010 to 2023 it was increasing at a rate of 4.5% per year. With a conservative number, we could say that year by year it could average 4%, 18-20 trillion $ per year. If even just a fraction of this increase in net worth makes its way into BTC, the potential for a price increase is insane. The question is, how does this happen? ETFs and Michael Saylor are showing no signs of slowing down. A small number of companies are starting to copy Microstrategy's play book and many more will begin to do this as well in the coming years. Tradfi is in the early stages of getting involved and it will be normal for 401ks and other funds to allocate a percentage into BTC. This will do nothing but continue to grow in the coming years. Real estate is another major sector that I think will see some major changes. Big investment companies during COVID were buying up single family properties and land in many growing metros/states across the U.S. Phoenix, DFW, Florida, Las Vegas, etc. However, real estate requires taxes, maintenance costs, etc. I could see big money players showing more interest in BTC as a form of ""digital real estate"" where the potential for profit is substantially higher than what real estate could ever offer. I could imagine this scenario being beneficial for the average person where real estate moves away from being an investment tool to being what it is supposed to be, which is a place for a family to live. Nation states getting involved is a huge variable as well. The U.S will end up creating a BTC reserve, but I do NOT think it is going to hit it's target of 1 million BTC. There are several other nations that have and will show interest in this, Kazakhstan is one recent example. Eventually, nations across the globe will collectively show interest in creating BTC reserves. The demand is going to do nothing but increase while the supply is rapidly decreasing = incredible price action.",2025-10-27 22:42:22,ubermensch1001,post,bitcoin,,Reddit

Stack sats, self-custody, the whole thing. But here's where the philosophy meets reality. I freelance, and more clients want to pay in BTC. Amazing, right? Except I still need to pay rent, buy groceries, cover business expenses - all in fiat. My current workflow is painful: receive BTC payment. Send to exchange (already compromising on self-custody). Convert to fiat (taxable event + fees). Wait 3-5 days for bank transfer. Finally access the money I earned a week ago. By the time it's done: 2-3% in fees, tons of time wasted, and a tax reporting nightmare. I looked into platform of [Kea]( that supposedly bridge crypto and traditional banking with instant stablecoin settlements - could keep most in BTC, off-ramp only what I need. But using any custodial service feels like I'm missing the point. What bothers me is that we've solved the hardest problems - decentralized money, trustless transactions, censorship resistance. But that last mile? Still depends on centralized exchanges, traditional banking rails, government permission, and custodial services. I want to live on a Bitcoin standard. But right now it feels like I'm living on a ""Bitcoin + painful fiat conversion"" standard.

p_1ogsvzn,"Buffered ETF play for Bitcoin exposure Due to recent regulation changes in my country, taking new positions in spot Bitcoin ETFs (like $IBIT, $FBTC, et al.) is barred. And, owning Bitcoin in cold storage seems a hassle I would prefer to avoid. As such, I have currently identified two possible instruments to fulfill my requirements for crypto exposure: # 1. ETFs on Crypto Proxy Indices ETFs holding crypto-miners or digital asset stocks, such as $BITQ, $WGMI, etc. # 2. Structured/Synthetic ETFs Funds/ETFs using options, futures, or other derivatives that are not flagged as ""1:1 Bitcoin ETFs"" in my jurisdiction such as buffered ETFs or floor ETFs. I believe Structured ETFs would be the best bet to achieve the most faithful, direct exposure to Bitcoin's price movement, as Crypto Proxy Indices ($BITQ, etc.) seem to have a much higher beta (though I am not closed to a mixed allocation). One ETF I have earmarked for now is $QBF (Innovator Uncapped Bitcoin 20 Floor ETF - Quarterly Series) It seems the most promising since it has the following characteristics: |Feature|Details| |:-|:-| |**Downside Protection**|A **20% Floor**. I cannot lose more than 20% of the underlying Bitcoin index's loss in any quarter (before fees and expenses).| |**Upside Structure**|**Uncapped** (The major advantage over competitors).| |**Participation Rate**|For every 1% gain in the underlying Bitcoin index, I receive approx 0.71% of the gain. This reduced sensitivity is the trade-off for establishing the 20% floor. The floor and participation rates are subject to change every quarter.| I have ruled out offerings from other providers like Calamos and First Trust, as they seem to offer only a limited, hard-capped upside (e.g., max gain of 30%) in exchange for a very generous floor. # The Questions For those who are familiar with these Defined Outcome/Structured ETFs, whether on Bitcoin or other indices like the Nasdaq/S&P 500, I have a few specific concerns: 1. I have read on various forums about these being viewed as poor investments (similar to the skepticism often aimed at covered call or high-dividend ETFs). Is this reputation warranted for $QBF? 2. Hidden Costs: Will I be unknowingly shot in the foot by any hidden 'fee' or the cost of outlaying this options strategy that I am not getting now? Is there any case of ETF provider taking a cut of the upside that my layman brain has not understood yet? 3. For those who have taken positions in $QBF or similar uncapped ETFs (like those tracking Nasdaq or S&P), how have they performed? Are the real-world returns faithful to the mechanics outlined in the prospectus? 4. Are there any other uncapped structured/buffered Bitcoin ETFs that you believe would be a superior choice to $QBF for my usecase?",2025-10-26 20:02:12,Kismetmania,post,bitcoin,,Reddit

p_1ogllf4,"The Bitcoin Whitepaper Footnotes — Part 1 **Examining Satoshi's References and beyond for breadcrumbs** Recently I've been diving down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, reading the Whitepaper references. My goal is to get a sense of what Satoshi was thinking about at the time, and how they arrived at their invention of Bitcoin from these eight cited sources. [https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/bitcoin.pdf]( There were likely other sources of inspiration that contributed to Satoshi's invention of Bitcoin, such as the references within the 8 Whitepaper footnotes, or other academic publications before 2009. If you want to get a head start on this series, I've done a few twitter threads analyzing most of the 8 footnotes. The plan is to more formally review these threads, and include two more reviews looking at b-money by Wei Dai\[1\], and an interesting theory about these references that was recently put forward by Stornetta\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]. Stornetta is one of the godfathers behind timestamp servers. Through this review, it became evident the primary people of interest are Adam Back, Scott Stornetta & Stuart Haber, and Henri Massias. Stornetta and Haber are cited multiple times for their foundational works on timestamp servers. While Adam Back is cited for his proof work paper. Meanwhile, Massias is the outlier, being an unknown name in the field of timestamp servers, which suggests something subtle. By reading through these papers, it became evident that Bitcoin is a distributed timestamp server driven by a proof of work mechanism that fairly distributes the ""money"" of that server in such a way that aligns incentives for the parties involved. A Nash equilibrium emerges through this fly wheel of value creation via a consistent issuance schedule lottery on a permission-less, global, open source, censorship resistant timestamp ledger. All these pieces were floating around in these papers and elsewhere before 2009. It appears Satoshi was simply the first to amalgamate these into a working digital bank.

Traditional assets get rescued, inflated, or “revalued.” Bitcoin can’t be patched over like that every tick, every change, every rule is transparent. It doesn’t “beat” inflation. It simply refuses to play that game. Its monetary policy is fixed no one can print more, ever. Every four years, new supply gets cut in half. 2012. 2016. 2020. 2024. Less new Bitcoin, same or higher demand the math does the rest. And like clockwork, every cycle repeats: governments dismiss it → media mocks it → institutions quietly buy it → the public rushes in late → everything resets. No promises. No yield. No central control. Just a network enforcing scarcity every ten minutes, for everyone, forever. That’s what makes it dangerous to systems built on dilution and debt. Bitcoin doesn’t ask for trust.

Let's break it down. **The ""Keys"" = Your 12 or 24-word ""seed phrase.""** This phrase is the password that *is* your money. # The Analogy: A Bank vs. Cash in Your Pocket **1. Keeping Bitcoin on an Exchange (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken):** * This is like leaving your money in a **bank**. * You log in and the bank's website *shows* you a balance. ""You have $1,000."" * But do you *really*? The bank is just holding an IOU for you. * The bank controls the vault. They can freeze your account, get hacked, or go bankrupt (see: FTX, Celsius). * If the bank fails, your money is gone. * **Conclusion: You don't have the keys. Those are not your coins.** **2. Keeping Bitcoin in a Self-Custody Wallet (Trezor, Ledger, Muun, BlueWallet):** * This is like holding **physical cash (or gold) in your own personal safe** at home. * You, and *only* you, have the key (your 12/24 word phrase). * It's 100% *your* responsibility.

p_1ofhku2,"The CAMT Exemption Confirms It: Bitcoin Is Now Audit-Ready Corporate Property. The U.S. Treasury just removed the biggest tax threat to corporate Bitcoin treasuries, signaling a major policy shift toward regulated inclusion. This relief is immediately paired with a strict new audit burden, locking Bitcoin into the formal corporate compliance infrastructure. The core conviction is that regulatory clarity on tax liability is the final structural seal of approval for Bitcoin. Knowledge is the real flex here. 1) Existential Tax Threat Removed: The U.S. Treasury granted an exemption clarifying that unrealized gains on digital asset holdings will be exempt from the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. This removes the existential 15% phantom tax liability that deterred corporate treasuries. 2) Mandatory Corporate Disclosure: The IRS has expanded mandatory disclosure of digital assets to all corporate, partnership, and trust forms. This formalizes the compliance burden on all corporate entities holding BTC. 3) Accounting Volatility Challenge: Despite the CAMT relief, mark-to-market accounting injects substantial volatility into reported earnings for Bitcoin treasuries. This remains the key psychological barrier deterring conservative corporate adoption. Policy is steering capital with a dual approach: massive tax relief and strict audit requirements.

Not because there’s hidden truth in it, but because it shows most people still don’t get what this is about. Bitcoin isn’t a fad or a get-rich-quick scheme. It’s a **response** —to inflation, to endless money printing, to central banks injecting liquidity like there’s no tomorrow. It’s the **thermometer of global monetary fever**. 📉 In recent years, it’s estimated that **around 80% of all U.S. dollars in circulation were created after 2020**. It’s not an exact figure —depends on how you measure it— but it captures the scale of what happened. Never in modern history has so much money been created in such a short time. And when money loses value due to oversupply, investors naturally look for something that **cannot be printed**. That’s where **Bitcoin** comes in. It’s not magic or pure speculation; it’s a **logical reaction** to a system that only knows how to print its way out of every problem. As long as the world keeps financing deficits and political campaigns with new debt, **Bitcoin will keep rising** — not because of faith, but because of **math**. There will only ever be **21 million**. Nothing more. That’s why I don’t see it as a gamble, but as **insurance against monetary stupidity**. 📊 This chart says it all: **money printing has become the system’s main engine**.

Not “Bitcoin at $100k.” Not “Bitcoin at $500k.” I mean the exact moment 1 BTC trades for the median American home price (currently around ~$430k–$500k depending on the index). That crossover is a civilization-level event. For both asset classes. And for the economy as a whole. At that point: Bitcoin isn’t being compared to real estate… it has become real estate. Financial advisors, pensions, governments are forced to care, not debate. Talent, capital, regulation, and geopolitical power tilt instantly and irreversibly. Liquidity rotation begins: not “crypto bros buying houses,” but houses being sold for Bitcoin. It becomes impossible to dismiss because Bitcoin has become the unit sitting opposite the biggest asset class in America.

p_1oeua8d,"Scenario: How to increase Bitcoin holdings without additional equity Hello everyone! The last days I took a deeper dive into the topic of asset-backed loans and wanted to see what can be achieved with them in terms of maxing out your Bitcoin holdings. I have build a scenario based on Bitcoins daily close data. I am aware that these kind of loans with Bitcoin as collateral did not exist back then and nobody was aware of any kind of cycles, but let us just assume the following as a thought experiment: Start date: 15.11.2010 Initial Investment: $1,000 LTV (loan to value): 25% Interest: 9 %, fully capitalized into the loan Loan run time: 4 years 1) On the start date, Bitcoin was valued at $0.27. I was able to acquire 3,703.7 BTC with Cash and further 925.93 BTC with the loan (4,629.63 BTC in total). 2) Four years later, the Bitcoin are worth $1.8 million in total. I can adjust the loan by $454k and buy 1,157.13 BTC with that (5,786.76 in total) 3) Further four years later, portfolio stands at $32 million. Loan of $7.3 million adds 1,334.2 BTC (7,120.97 BTC in total) 4) Last event yet in 2022, my portfolio would stand at $120 million. Loan of $19.9 adds 1,180.84 BTC (8,301.81 BTC in total) 5) Today these 8,301.81 BTC would be worth about $914 million If I had just bought and held, I would be worth $407.8 million. The loans helped me to buy 4,598.11 BTC, so about 1,5x my initial investment. Today total loan owed including interest would stand at $25.3 million. This would mean a net worth of $889 million or a bit more than double of just buying and holding. Now I know this is a very risky endeavour (Total owed/Total value was close to 45% at one point), but still shows what is possible. There probably may be even better points in time to buy if you happen to catch the bear market bottoms, but I tried to have evenly spread good entries every 4 years.",2025-10-24 11:38:00,Romanizer,post,bitcoin,,Reddit

p_1oeon57,"Decoy wallets aren't useful. The only way to preserve your coins in a wrench atack is to be unable to access them. Every tutorial recommend setting a passphrase and letting some funds in the no-passphrase wallet as a decoy. You could even leave some funds in a passphrase wallet and have the majority of your stash in another passphrase. By now any thief would know that. He would ask you to keep opening decoy wallets until you open a ver big one. How big, it depends on the thief. You may even open your true wallet and the thief could keep asking you to open the true wallet, expecting more coins. Depending on how have you managed your privacy and transaction history he may even know exactly how much do you have. So, I think the only realistic way to protect your coins is to be totally unable to comply with the thief. I can think several ways to archive that: - Not having your hardware wallet, neither your seed words at home. If you only hodl, this is not a problem. If you want to spend, you could have some funds in a smaller wallet at home. - A 2 of 3 Multisig, having the other 2 keys in separate location at several hours of travel - Coldcard HW have the possibility to set an alternative PIN which wipes or bricks the device. This is nice, but the thief could know that and threaten you to not use it. I don't know if other brands have something similar. - Coldcard also have the possibility to set some conditions of volume and velocity of your spendings. I think they do it through a Multisig. This is perhaps the simplest solution. Those are not perfect solutions. The thief could get mad, threaten you or even harming you, but relaying in a decoy wallet is a much worse strategy in my opinion. If the thief is rational, if he sees that your are truly unable to access your coins, he should leave you.",2025-10-24 05:37:15,Lanky-Occasion8005,post,bitcoin,,Reddit

This high correlation confirms the long-term institutional valuation thesis of BTC as a primary store of value. 2) Institutional Supply Shock: BlackRock's IBIT contributed $477M in net ETF inflows, confirming routine, systematic allocation from large asset managers. This ""sticky"" capital provides a deep structural floor for Bitcoin. 3) Liquidity Paradox: The temporary price action where ""BTC down first, gold lags"" is simply due to BTC being the most liquid digital risk asset, confirming its efficiency.

p_1oej29q,"The ""21 million limit"" feels kinda misleading when everyone trades fractions anyway I've been learning about Bitcoin and something isn't adding up with how we talk about scarcity. Everyone keeps saying ""only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist"" like that's some tiny number. But then I learned each Bitcoin breaks down into 100 million satoshis. So actually there's 2.1 QUADRILLION satoshis total. That's not exactly a small number. And here's the thing - literally nobody I know who owns Bitcoin has a whole coin. Everyone's buying like $50 or $200 worth. We're all trading in these tiny fractions. The whole economy runs on satoshis, not whole bitcoins. So why do we keep using the 21 million number to talk about scarcity? If the real tradeable units are in the quadrillions, how is that scarce? Yeah yeah, I get it - cutting a pizza into more slices doesn't give you more pizza. The total VALUE doesn't change. But when you're trying to convince people Bitcoin is rare and limited, you're using the 21 million figure while conveniently ignoring that there are quadrillions of actual units people can buy and trade. It's like measuring the US dollar supply in pennies and then being shocked there are trillions of them. The divisibility is actually genius - don't get me wrong. But calling it ""scarce"" based on 21 million when there are 2.1 quadrillion tradeable units feels like we're moving the goalposts. Am I completely off base here or does anyone else see what I'm getting at?",2025-10-24 00:53:38,Which_Courage_5615,post,bitcoin,,Reddit
p_1oeikqr,"Bitcoin Cycles & Fed Chair Timelines (no crystal ball) Bitcoin often topped within 2 months before Fed Chair end of term and, selloff into bear market a month after new Fed Chair or new term. That doesn’t cause the move but those windows come with policy headlines and shifting expectations, which markets react to. Timeline: Late 2013 to early 2014 (Bernanke step down Yellen start) * BTC cycle top: Dec 2013 ($1.2k). * Chair change: Jan 31, 2014 Bernanke ends, Feb 3, 2014 Yellen starts (2 months after the BTC cycle top). * What followed: a sharp monthly drop of 32% arrived in March 2014 (1 month after). Late 2017 to early 2018 (Yellen step down Powell start) * BTC cycle top: Dec 2017 ($19.7k). * Chair change: Feb 3 to 5, 2018 Yellen ends, Powell starts (2 months after the BTC cycle top). * What followed: another steep monthly selloff 33% in March 2018(1 month after). Late 2021 to mid 2022 (Powell term renewal) * BTC late cycle high: Nov 2021 (\~$69k). * Chair milestone: first term ended on Feb 5th 2022 (2.5 months); second term was delayed and confirmed on May 2022 (during the shift to rate hikes/QT). * What followed: the bear market accelerated into a 37% red candle June 2022( again 1 month after). Why the Fed Chair Matters for Bitcoin: The U.S. dollar dominates global finance, used in 88% of transactions and 59% of reserves, making the Fed’s monetary policy a key driver of Bitcoin’s price. The Fed controls liquidity via interest rates and QE/QT. Loose policy boosts risk assets like Bitcoin, tight policy suppresses them. Inflation fears also fuel Bitcoin’s “digital gold” appeal. The Fed Chair leads the FOMC, setting policy tone and expectations. A new Chair in 2026 could signal policy shifts, impacting Bitcoin’s volatility. While Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, its trading environment is fiat driven, tying its cycles to Fed actions. Future Outlook: Powell’s second term ends May 23, 2026. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could peak around Feb or March 2026 (2+ months prior), potentially followed by a bear market in June 2026, marked by a 30\~40% correction. However, external factors like regulation or global events could shift timelines. my risk metric isn’t flagging a hot zone (80-100) for Bitcoin this cycle yet, we might still have time. Currently BTC 110k = risk 48 over 100.",2025-10-24 00:30:53,hduynam99,post,bitcoin,,Reddit

p_1ohexzh,"The Reasoning Layer: Why Dashboards Make You Dumb on a 50k TPS Chain The core problem with data on a high-throughput network like Solana is a simple paradox: the more dashboards you open, the worse your trades get. Everyone thinks the edge is in having more raw data, but after years of staring at charts, I realized 95% of on-chain activity is pure, irrelevant noise. This is especially true on a Web-scale blockchain built for 50k TPS. The true alpha is hiding in the remaining 5% patterns so subtle that only reasoning, not reporting, can catch them. The core conviction is that AI doesn't need more data; it needs better thoughts. We are teaching models to summarize markets, but not to reason through them. 1) The Problem Dashboards are dead. Every on-chain interface feels the same: cold, raw, and noisy. I got tired of being lied to by a flood of liquidity metrics and basic wallet alerts. The sheer volume of transactions that Solana enables at near-zero cost is now the problem itself: volume without verified intent is data noise. 2) The Solution (The Technical Brag) I didn't build AI to predict price; I built it because I was tired of the information deficit. It took 1000+ hours, scanning across 10,000+ tokens (including the entire Solana dApp ecosystem), and way too much caffeine, but I’ve got a reasoning layer that now ignores that 95% noise in real time. This layer surfaces narrative flows and strategic wallet shifts before they show up on charts. It’s not another dashboard. It's the beginning of intelligence. That's my side of the story all about fighting the data noise on a high-speed chain.

Founders can begin entering details for their projects and continue editing until the October 30, 11:59 PM PDT deadline. Time to lock in those final updates and bring your best work to the finish line! **Here's what's featured in this week's issue:** * SBPB Linker Opens Other Languages for Solana Programs * Range Launches Fully Onchain Risk Verification * ORE Relaunches with a Brand New Mining Protocol * Trident Releases a VS Code Extension for Security Checks * SIMD-0266 Proposes Replacing SPL Token Program with p-token * Meteora Announces Launchpad Upgrades # 🔁 SBPF Linker Opens New Languages I wrote about the launch of the [SBPF Linker built by Blueshift]( last week, which has opened the door for developers to build Solana programs in entirely new ways. In just the past week, developers have successfully compiled programs in Swift, C, Nim, Zig, and even Python, expanding beyond Rust as the primary language for Solana programs. Early community experiments include: * [**C-Nocchio**]( A minimal proof of concept showing Solana programs can be written in pure C with direct syscalls, zero-copy data handling, and a simple macro for the entrypoint. * [**Clana**]( A lightweight template that lets developers build Solana BPF programs in standard C, with no Solana SDK required, direct syscalls, LLVM-based builds, and Rust integration testing. * [**Pylana**]( A hand-built transpiler that uses Python to generate Solana-compatible code through LLVM IR. * [**Zignocchio**]( A POC showing how to build Solana programs in Zig, featuring the Zignocchio SDK, auto-generated syscall bindings, and a fully automated Zig build and testing pipeline. * [**Swiftana**]( Compiles Swift into Solana BPF programs, featuring custom LLVM passes, direct syscalls, and full Rust-based integration testing. * [**Nimlana**]( Shows how to build Solana BPF programs in Nim, leveraging Nim’s C compilation to target Solana for educational and testing purposes. While most are still proofs of concept, this marks a major step toward making Solana development accessible to a wider range of developers and communities. *Sadly, I'm still waiting for* [*C#*]( 😞 # 🛡️ Range's Onchain Risk Verifier Range has launched onchain account risk verification for Solana programs, powered by its Risk API and Switchboard’s On-Demand Oracles. Range’s onchain risk verifier brings real-time, signed risk data directly into Solana programs without forcing critical security and compliance checks to happen outside program logic. Developers can now verify wallet and counterparty risk in real time using signed, tamper-proof data directly inside programs. The flow is simple: 1. A client requests a signed “quote” from Range’s Risk API through a Switchboard OracleJob. 2. Switchboard’s oracles execute the job, sign the result, and return it to the program 3. Program verifies the signature with QuoteVerifier before acting on it. Because Switchboard’s oracles work on demand, developers avoid continuous data feeds and extra infrastructure while keeping verifiable security. To get started, developers can follow the [Integrate Range's Onchain Risk Verifier into your Solana Program]( guide to learn how to request risk quotes with the Switchboard SDK and verify them onchain. [**Risk Intelligence. Now onchain for Solana programs**]( # ⛏️ ORE Relaunch ORE has relaunched its mining protocol on Solana with a complete redesign aimed at creating a Solana-native store of value. The new mining mechanism uses a 5x5 grid where miners claim space with SOL over one-minute rounds. The SOL from 24 losing blocks is distributed proportionally to claimants on the one winning block, which is selected by a secure random number generator. The protocol includes a Motherlode feature, a pool that accumulates ORE each round and is randomly awarded to winning miners. A key change is the introduction of protocol revenue and value capture. 10% of all SOL mining rewards are collected as revenue to automatically buy back ORE from the open market. This purchased ORE is then ""buried"" (removed from circulation but can be mined again), potentially leading to net deflation. The protocol has already driven over 990 SOL in buybacks over the past week. Additionally, a 10% refining fee on claimed ORE rewards is redistributed to other miners based on their unclaimed rewards, incentivizing long-term holding. Staking is funded by 10% of the ORE bought back with protocol revenue, offering a non-dilutive yield for long-term holders. ORE’s revenue growth has been accelerating rapidly, crossing $130K in 24hr protocol revenue. [**Re-introducing: ORE**]( # 🔱 Trident VS Code Extension Trident has launched the first VS Code extension designed specifically for Solana development, bringing real-time security analysis into the IDE. The extension provides two key features: 1. Automatic vulnerability detection 2. Visual feedback on test coverage The static analysis feature includes a wide range of detectors that catch common Solana-specific security issues such as missing signer checks, unsafe lamports zeroing, and attempts to mutate immutable accounts. These checks run as developers type, allowing early identification of potential problems before code review or audit. The integrated fuzz coverage visualization shows which parts of the code are tested to help developers find edge cases that unit tests may miss. The extension is free, open source, and works with any Solana project. [**The first VS Code extension for Solana is here**]( # ⏫ SIMD-0266: p-token SIMD-0266, proposes replacing the current SPL Token program with a CU version called p-token. Authored by developers at Anza, this update aims to cut token program CUs by up to 98%, unlocking more capacity for onchain activity and boosting Solana’s overall throughput. Currently, token program instructions consume around 10% of each block’s compute budget. By reducing that figure to a fraction of its current level, p-token could free nearly 12% of block space, allowing more transactions to fit in each block. The proposal introduces a complete reimplementation of the SPL Token program with zero-copy data access and no heap allocations, while remaining fully backward compatible so developers won’t need to modify existing code. If approved by validators, this change would be one of the most significant efficiency upgrades in Solana’s core infrastructure to date. [**SIMD-0266: Efficient Token Program**]( # 🚀 Meteora Launchpad Upgrades Meteora has introduced three major upgrades to give projects more control over how tokens launch on Solana. * **Presale Vaults:** Let teams raise funds with custom conditions, such as launching only after a funding goal is met, ensuring demand-driven and secure launches. * **Meteora Invent:** Streamlines the launch process with a toolkit that automates complex setup steps, allowing teams to deploy tokens quickly without deep technical expertise. * **Dynamic Fee Sharing**: Enables projects to design custom, non-custodial fee distribution models, deciding exactly how and to whom launch fees are shared. These upgrades give projects more control and customization in how they distribute their token launches.

c_nltbcd1,"Huge congrats, solo-finding a block is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. Seriously well done. A few practical notes (for anyone who might hit this jackpot too): * Security first: don’t share TXIDs, addresses, or your exact setup. Expect DMs from “helpers.” Ignore them. * Cold storage: move proceeds to a hardware wallet you control (fresh addresses); consider a passphrase/multisig if it fits your threat model. * Coinbase maturity: for solo miners reading along, a coinbase reward normally needs 100 confirmations before it’s spendable. If you used a pool payout, the pool handles this. * UTXO hygiene: label what’s what, avoid address reuse, and split large UTXOs thoughtfully if you’ll make future spends. * Taxes: set aside the tax portion now, and speak with a qualified tax pro. Estimated payments can help avoid penalties. * Cash-out plan: if you’re paying off the mortgage, stage conversions rather than one big sell; minimize slippage and keep records for your accountant. * If you don’t want to sell: some folks prefer to **borrow against BTC** to access liquidity while keeping exposure. If that’s your route, do due diligence on rates, LTVs, margin call policies, and custody. Xapo Bank offers this option as well for qualified members. Enjoy the win, you earned it.

c_nlwisni,"You have an interesting point. $800k is close indeed to what was predicted (that is all to be seen though). Back then when experts, financial modelers, economists and tech guys looked at it and were considering its implications it was $2m per BTC and that was way back then during times close to conception before like <150 to 35k. Why I asked the sages here is as per my humble observation is might it be higher or lower because we measured it against the market and looked at it as a store of value asset like gold for example. Though the thing is its utility is extremely far reaching, example in space travel for example we now have something we could use for remittance (and that is crypto). Well unless something changes in our timeline... we'll see. My reason for asking is we knew the upper limit back then based on 1 factor but now with all these other factors I wonder... isn't it a little too undervalued? Makes me wonder all the time. Thanks for your amazing input, let me re-analyze things. Edit: So basically if you factor in the inflation, assets backed by btc, owners & wallets, population and global gdp and things I mentioned in my previous comment the amount should be much higher but also the factors you talked about made me rethink about other discoveries and interesting possibilities too (coming from a long time enthusiast) Edit2: That was it from a utilitarian point of view as it combines all the features of money and tech into 1 thing. As you said too things can go the other way so please do ignore this rumbling and just look at it as a discussion Edit3: The idea was that 1 BTC was 100,000,000 SATs and what people will use was SATs when the time came or something, I don't know I forgot it was been a very long while since I last looked into it (and if you put things into that perspective it makes you rethink the value and all too)",2025-10-28 22:46:09,morning_night_owl,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit

c_nlrxz5n,"I'm one of those people that told everyone, friends and family alike, to buy back in 2013. A little earlier than that for some of them. I ran into one of my old friends who I had previously helped purchase 10 BTC (and I once sold a Casascius coin to back in 2014) earlier this year. He said, ""I wish I would have bought coin back when you told me to!"" When I told him he did buy coin and I helped him do it he shook his head and laughed. ""Yeah, but I sold all those about a year later after it fell in price."" He meant he should have listened to me and bought it again when I mentioned it again on my social media in like 2017. I told him he could still buy Bitcoin today, but he said it's too expensive. Some people are just not meant to be Bitcoiners. They have a ""victim of circumstance"" demeanor when it comes to their finances. They follow trends, never set them. They talk about things they see on the news, and never seek knowledge from the original sources. They have next to no understanding of value, nor do they have the saving mindset. I don't think they even possess the capability to change into a saver's mindset, either. There's an old adage that you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. I used to think the adage was just a cute saying, maybe something relating to people who are good at something not realizing they have a knack for it. I realized that day what it really meant... It means that most of what we teach each other is ignored. Very few people actually seek out knowledge or have a desire to learn more and more, as much as they can about the world and their place in it. Or they hear it and for whatever reason they don't process it. They'll go visit some new location but they are there for the ""experience"", because they saw a Youtube video or streamer talk about the place, or they heard about a vacation there from a friend, not actually to learn about whatever the tour guide tells them or to actually understand the struggles of the locals or the history. These are the same people that give you a blank stare when you talk about how you have 15 tabs of Wikipedia open on your browser right now, or their eyes glaze over when you talk about a new technology that you are messing around with and the struggles you are having implementing software changes on the newest hardware. When you start talking about the history of money, they fall asleep. You can hold the cup of knowledge right against some people's lips, and just like the horse, unless they are actually thirsty, they aren't going to drink it.",2025-10-28 05:40:37,Yorn2,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit

Way more than if they just tried to buy with what is remaining at the end of the month. Do this 4 years and 4 years salary doubles to 8 years salary. The loan is 2 years salary. You gain 4 years salary from taking on 2 years salary worth of debt. Then it will double again. Very soon you see how the capitalism game works best. Trade debt for assets.

c_nlkolcc,"Maybe like for most people I was devastated when I was liquidated several times in beginning using big leverages, knowing about whales and price manipulation made me almost quit. So you have 2 choices basically you quit or stay and in case you stay, you should first play by the rules and avoid at all cost being emotional. My biggest mistake in the beginning was being too greedy with the leverage and fomo that made me buy always in the wrong moment/price. Have to be focused and cool and if you missed an up or down wave then just wait for the next one. traditional stock market works the same, the difference is that with the crypto you can buy it by yourself without a broker and endless fees. Of course it is more fluctuating but you can make higher and faster profits. Traditional stock market and real estate to some extent, beside being manipulated are heavily taxed depending on where you live. With crypto you have at least the chance to bypass these taxes and broker/middle man fees. Manipulation is in everything if you look and analyse carefully",2025-10-27 01:57:18,General-Vermicelli18,comment,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

What does any crypto currency have? Now a lot of people talk about the ""gold standard"" as if it's the holy grail of currencies, but really, why? While having some limited industrial uses, it also has no intrinsic value, just like any other currency. No?

The best time to buy is the boring flat period in between when no action, no influencer, no news is happening, and then just wait until bull market to sell.

c_nlmaljl,"It’s not a question of if, but rather when Bitcoin will fall below the $100,000 mark. Many new BTC holders have yet to experience the inevitable bear cycles and the significant percentage drops that accompany them. The past three years have felt almost unrealistic, like a bubble waiting to burst. While this bull run may have some momentum left, it's only a matter of time before a substantial event disrupts the meteoric rise of BTC, triggering panic and leading to a painful capitulation. We should be prepared for unexpected black swan events that could arise from the most unlikely sources. One thing is certain: Bitcoin will undoubtedly plummet below $100,000. The extent of the drop is uncertain, but it will undoubtedly be severe and tumultuous. Despite this impending correction, my long-term outlook for the BTC price remains optimistic. However, we need to brace ourselves for a sharp and meaningful market adjustment before it continues its upward trajectory.

In my opinion yes, $8k is very possible, but not sure if it is based on the analysis, but instead historical macro data that could suggest it's the next top. But some say $10k, others say we're getting rekt. In the meantime we get insiders trading futures. So is the era of TA over?

c_nlrgzie,"The whale could actually be right though. Its not just leveraged once anymore. There is now three interconnected leverage layers that can all feed a crash. You have onchain and exchange leverage, cefi/defi borrowing and a etf layer which can cause a mass deleveraging event. Bitcoin is thinly traded compared to equities. Over 100b is borrowing right now alone on crypto and imo its probably up to 150b if we include overlapping hedges, options and smaller cefi books not fully disclosed. The last time a collapse happened it was around 150b borrowed at end of 2021. So that is my guess why these whales have big short positions. Doesn't mean crypto will collapse either since its more acceptable as a investment, but its definitely possible.

I actually started buying in 2019 when it was at $5,000 per coin, but didn’t understand it enough yet. I certainly wasn’t buying enough and not thinking about the future. I was buying it to use on the dark web. Once I began to realize what it really was, it was game on. I am now 100% a Bitcoin maxi, and I believe this is the escape hatch for people to break out of the unfair financial system we’ve been forced into. I buy the dips. I buy the all time highs. I buy everything in between. I have no number in my head that I need to reach so I can stop buying. I will buy indefinitely until one day down the road, I need it for something.

That could mean the painter has mispriced it, or just that it doesn't have a ready market - have they even tried? We don't know. Maybe the just need better PR. BTC does have a ready market, and people are willing to trade X amount of fiat currency for it. All the other ""reasons"" for value are extra. Sure they might inform your own ideas of what it is currently ""worth,"" and could be ""worth"" in future, but ultimately it's whether someone else is willing to buy it or not.

c_nld6wkc,"I guess it depends on what 3. I'm sure all the singles are thinking family can be excluded, And there certainly are plenty of people who are probably happy without family or at least convince themselves that they are. Search for Jimmy Carr's response to the question ""Why did you have kids"" He said: > “I had kind of an existential crisis... Yeah, I really wanted [kids]. Here's what I did. Genuinely, man to man, I'll tell you. I thought I was gaming the system by not having kids. I thought I was f**king smart Because I had such an easy life. I thought I was playing the video game of life and I’d found the cheat code. And it was easy, easy, easy. And then I got to my mid-40s and I went: ""Oh, I'm sitting at a bullsh!t, low stakes table and there's a bigger game to be played."" And then I had kids, and every other status game seemed trivial."" So even though I LOVE Bitcoin, I'd 100% give up fitness or Bitcoin before I voluntarily gave up my family. Providing for my family is one of the main reasons I even care about Bitcoin. I know how to thrive and be completely happy without BTC, and I can totally do it, but I'd prefer to have BTC for countless reasons. Also, ""ignorance is bliss"" So a person could argue that you don't need wisdom to be happy. However, only an idiot would give up wisdom. 😂",2025-10-25 21:14:33,choicehunter,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit

Why this is important is if the cycle breaks and we see BTC go up in 2026 that will be a change this cycle. This might very well happen given where BTC stands in overall asset class as it is now more of a ""main stream"" asset than it has ever been. Corporate treasury investment, sovereign wealth fund investment, pension plan investment, family office investment, and the list goes on. We are in times that BTC has not been in previously in a good way. BTC's price rises as its market cap rises. So if fiat, gold, equities, and other classes of assets get converted to BTC in a meaningful way we will definitely see prices continue to rise in 2026 breaking the previous cycle of 3 up 1 down.",2025-10-27 16:41:57,AU-n-Time,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit

c_nlnieey,"Yes, a version of this happens basically every time. Short-term holders get wrecked both ways because they trade, and even worse, they trade with leverage. The longer-term holders (a couple of years) who are in the green give up because they see other assets (stocks/gold) take off and they feel like they've missed the party. And eventually all of the selling is exhausted, bitcoin becomes boring and basically stays in a stable band (I would say it's somewhere between $80k - $120k right now-ish) When that's done, bitcoin will take off again. But at $100k+ bitcoin is pretty stable and a lot of long-term holders with 1,000+ bitcoin are offloading. It will end eventually. These cycles still exist, they are just less obvious than before because the halvings are less significant. We'll probably see this 'staircase' type pattern for longer than you think (maybe the majority of 2026 as well). But who knows? All I know is that I feel like bitcoin is a better store of value than gold (currently) and will be a better currency than the USD (eventually). So that's where I'm putting my savings.

c_nlnn3nz,"Sinceramente, podría ser. Bitcoin siempre ha tenido esa dinámica psicológica de *desesperar al retail* antes de moverse de verdad. Los grandes no necesitan comprar rápido, necesitan comprar barato y en silencio, y para eso lo mejor es un mercado aburrido donde la gente se rinde. Además, con las políticas de los bancos centrales cambiando (tasas a la baja, más liquidez, etc.) no sería raro que el despegue llegue cuando el sentimiento esté por los suelos, no cuando la narrativa está en su punto máximo. Bitcoin históricamente premia la paciencia, no la euforia. Lo único que tengo claro es que, pase cuando pase, el inversor medio sigue sin entender una cosa: tener BTC también significa tener estrategia. Yo en mi caso diversifico en real estate (incluso explorando cripto + inmuebles en Europa), porque si un día el mercado tarda más de lo esperado, prefiero que mi patrimonio no dependa solo de un ciclo. Pero tu teoría tiene sentido: *los máximos rara vez llegan cuando todos están mirando la pantalla esperando el cohete*. ¿Cuál sería tu señal personal de “ahora sí empezó el movimiento real”?",2025-10-27 15:42:02,VicoxLegal,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

Sometimes priced in, sometimes not (it depends on what analysts predict, as well as more company events). Apple announcing we have revamped the entire internet on their next sells pitch? Not priced in. Apple stock jumps insanely high, because people only expected new colors of some boring new iPhone. Let's simplify: essentially, anything that has ALREADY been concluded or even speculated by the masses (e.g. next Fed event is a 98% rate cut of .25) is priced in, and anything that has not been concluded yet, is not priced in. The change in price usually happens at the time of conclusion, but it can also happen before if there are any expectations for a good or a bad surprises, although the data remains unconcluded.

c_nlbuc0z,"The problem why so many have doubt with anything that one can invest in, is because most people have something called price bias. The result is your benchmark or reference point isn’t a representative or “factual” way to understand anything you can invest in. You seem to think BTC reaching 1M is impossible, assuming you are using USD, because to you 1M dollars is a lot of money. But did you know in 1922-24 Germany that a loaf of bread was worth over 1 trillion German dollars? It was because of hyperinflation that the currency was significantly devalued. Hopefully now you understand why your disbelief/doubt isn’t founded in the correct framework, ie price in ::insert:: currency. You have to look at mechanisms, such as intrinsic value (ie network effect), supply/demand effects (ie only 21M coins, fixed supply), and relative value (2.2-4T BTC and Gold is 30T and currency is around 100-120T), to really understand the potential of BTC. Then you have to understand that less than 4% of the world’s population owns BTC. It’s still price discovery wait for mass adoption and you can understand how 2.2T BTC could reach 10T, 20T, or match gold at 30T. If you are still having a hard time comprehending then consider the unit instead. Instead of BTC coins, think in term of satoshis. Right now a satoshi is worth $0.00115 US dollars.

To me that doesn't make any sense on the lender side. I have so many ways to get loans using my credit score where I don't have to put up my Bitcoin as collateral and have lower interest rates with those avenues too where I have no reason to even think about taking a collateralized Bitcoin loan and putting up my Bitcoin.

The problem with fiat currencies is you have to spend time and money exchanging them everywhere you go and using different payment mechanisms everywhere you go.

A simplification of what hashing is would be f.e.: To hash a book you could be assigning a number to each letter of each word in the book, and adding these numbers together. The resulting sum is a hash of the book. PoW works on the principle that you want the hash to start with some sequence, in that case zeros. So you increment a value called nonce that’s contained in the block until that’s true. Sticking with the book example, PoW is like finding a word that you could stick at the end of the book so that the sum ends with a specific number. The difference between the book example and sha256 is that while you could calculate what word to add exactly at the end of a book to achieve the desired result, an sha256 changes drastically and randomly with even the smallest of changes so you can’t predict it. You need to calculate it for each nonce until you’re lucky.",2025-10-25 20:31:47,DescriptorTablesx86,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit

c_nlpdzls,I can't believe so many people still misunderstand BTC so badly. BTC Main chain is not intended to be direct world currency for daily transactions. It is perfectly designed as a base layer protocol similar to Fedwire or TCP/IP. Those are base layers. But built on top of the base layer are many sublayers that make it versatile and even more powerful. You likely use their sublayers every day even though everything with finance/money or Internet is ultimately settled with those base layer protocols. They are absolutely right that BTC itself isn't directly a good currency. Any more than fedwire is a good method for billions of transactions per second either and TCP/IP can't handle all of the super complex stuff we do through the internet without its secondary And other sublayers. It's totally fine if people hoard the base layer as a store of value and the ultimate Apex property. There will be plenty of sub layers that will allow it to be used as currency and a billion other things totally unrelated to money. The base protocol is always more simple than what the sublayers turn it into.,2025-10-27 20:55:17,choicehunter,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit

c_nldrj59,How so? Because all I have been seeing recently is rug pulls and tweets that make markets dip so that they can extract wealth from investors. To me it started when Elon said he was considering letting people pay for Teslas using Dogecoin.

Price gets high enough where they want to sell... put in some shorts.... have Trump squawk about tariffs or some shit.... price drops... their shorts payoff while a bunch of people lose their shirts. I feel like the original spirit of crypto is gone now and the people you were trying to get a leg up on have completely taken it over.

Monero, Dash, and Zcash were the big three in that space for a long time. Monero has suffered because of de-listings and thus has lost some liquidity, but remains a large cap. Zcash has stuck around (much more so than Dash) and other protocols have entered the space too. You've probably only recently heard of Railgun either (which has performed incredibly well too) but it's been a favourite of privacy minded Ethereum users for the past couple of years (I use it almost daily). It had/has a marketedly small MC and has been undervalued for a long time.

Nor does the amount of money lost when market cap tanks actually leave the market. The price is simply the current demand and what people are willing to pay. For a market cap to actually have that much money in it.. You'd need every bitcoin currently in circulation to be sold at current price. That can never happen..

Population that’s not getting adequate replacement ratio. Too many median to upper income would have transferred their money out had it not for capital control, and even with capital control, hundreds of billions have been going out. China actual debt is significantly worse than US…conservatively estimated to exceed 500 to 1 debt to GDP (US around 125, still pretty bad). In addition to local debts, there are also departmental/ministries independent bond issuance (most prominent being those issued by the previous Ministry of Railways). Additionally the majority of China’s “private” corporations have significant or even majority government ownership, thus exposing the government to the huge liability in their books as well. Add it altogether the debt to gdp ratio is conservatively estimated at over 500%, which will have to be burdened by an aging population.

That the US has been written of for decades makes sense because these things take decades to work out. But now the level of disfunction in the states has progressed to terminal degree. China's strength is showing in the traide negotiations now. The US has been surved amazing hand, and if it somehow gets it's shit together it could be formidable. It's death throws will probably be spectacular. Government debt is a meme. It's private debt that causes crisis. No one is rolling up on the CCP demanding repayment. The CCPs integration into the economy means it can catch any crisis which is mearly in the financial or legal realm. When it comes to that stuff, the state is able to rewrite the rules on the fly. The US is absolutely not able to do that. It's not such a good place for capital owners, but it turns out that doesn't matter for the strength of the economy. Western economists can complain all they want but they are the most habitually incorrect group on the planet, next to astrologers. But China's strength comes from it's real economy.

But a lot of things that has been or would have been problems for other countries are not such a big deal to china. For example how everyone was freaking out about their alleged over production of houses. That was supposed to take down their entire economy. But china has shown it can resolve that kind of thing no problem. China is able to recognize challenges, make plans, and put resources behind it.

With an improved wallet, you can then explore many options. Many young investors have issues with the variable element - time. So when they make a purchase today, 90 days for them feels like forever, not to talk of 2 - 3 years (where they start to enter their first take profit zone).

c_nlw1v4q,"I similarly made it to my milestone (Ill keep numbers out of it - but suffice to say I'm a normal 29 year old with normal amount of money). I still put funds in here and there during the notable dips but not as much as I used to for the same reason as you (not all eggs in one basket). Since then, for fun, I set up a solo lottery miner (with a gekkoscience compac f miner and a raspberry pi)... it's fun to check the numbers every now and then, and the energy is only 2 to 4 dollars per month - this is worth it to me for the fun of it. And I've determined my odds are equivalent to buying about 10 powerball tickets per day. Anyway, now when I have investing money, I throw the majority of it into my Roth IRA (which is a post-tax investment - meaning in 50 years or whatever whenever I can claim my returns, I don't pay tax on it... also, you can freely take out any amount without penalty UP TO the amount you've invested - so its like a 12% return savings account with compounding interest - the catch being you can only put in 7k per year or something like this, but like I said, I'm a normal 29 year old in today's age and 7k is a lot for me to have extra anyway). I set this up on vanguard, I'd recommend looking into it. I only buy into VTSAX as its a good representation of the entire market. I hope any of this helps. And I still dabble with more sats here and there, but like you, I'm fairly happy with the goal I've met (but like others have said, I do have a mental *next* goal.. I'm just not going all in for it anymore).",2025-10-28 21:22:43,zacguymarino,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit

Go right ahead. Just don't cry when your decentralized asset gets taken right out from under you due to policy changes. By submitting to taxes (IRS is a private company btw not even a fucking government agency) on digital goods you are allowing these governments to claim YOU as property and thus anything you hold. For those that even care if they can claim a digital good you hold they can also claim ownership of your mind/thoughts, literally. ""Non tangible assets"". The United States is failing due to lack of backbone of the human species. Nothing more or less. People want to be pets and so they shall get what they deserve moving forward.

c_nltjtc7,"Greetings from Buenos Aires! I have arrived early, thanks to the flexibility of the Ethereum Foundation. I'm exploring the city, of course, but also exploring the opportunities for decentralised and trustless use of crypto in the city. A few people on Twitter have commented that the need for cash in Buenos Aires has been greatly overstated. I took that mean that I didn't have to worry about carrying cash and I have to say, that has not been my experience at all. I ended up needing to get cash as a matter of urgency: * The deposit for a towel at the hostel: Cash only. * First coffee shop I walked into: We do not take cards. * Subway card: Topping it up can require cash depending on where * Restaurant for dinner: 15% discount if you pay in cash * Tips in general: Cash clearly highly preferred That's not to say you can't pay for many things with card; in fact for my SIM from Claro (specifically for tourists, requires showing a passport), she told me before we started that it was card only. I was unable to quickly find a means of converting stablecoins to cash through the exchange houses, although it is clear that such places exist. Next step is to try the local apps and see what options there are, although a friend of mine is worried that I seem happy to outsource my survival to apps that crash in dark mode. I did find one place that was crypto friendly last night: a brightly lit candy shop offering halloween treats and delicious things with a sign on the door: We accept Bitcoin Cash.

It generates no revenue. It's only valuable because people buy it at a higher price, that's it. First of all, this is just plain incorrect. There are many scenarios where bitcoin is faster/cheaper than using fiat currency (cash) and/or using third party financial products such as checks, Venmo/apps, credit cards, bank wires, etc. Obviously bitcoin is not the fastest and cheapest transaction method for all transaction types. There is no single system that has this quality for all transaction types. Even though you are wrong with your analysis, I don’t see how this has anything to do with your “Ponzi scheme” accusation. > That price is massively inflated by made up 'stable coins' minted out of thin air by unregulated exchanges set up by criminals. I see no evidence of this. If anything the ETFs show in real time how much demand there is even using a bitcoin investment product. > A criminal president resides in the White House who manipulates the price daily, facilitating insider trading for his own family and his rich mates to make bank.

It’s not a Ponzi scheme. Calling it that is just plain wrong. A Ponzi scheme is a defined scheme and Bitcoin shares literally nothing with a Ponzi scheme.

c_nlo1s34,"(Thinking of doing weekly reports/updates - turned out quite long, so very open to feedback) growthepie Weekly Summary (October 20-26, 2025) Last week, the Ethereum Ecosystem demonstrated significant progress in scalability, adoption, and community engagement. Scalability and Performance Insights * Recently Ethereum Ecosystem Transaction Per Second: Reached an all-time high of 3,100 TPS, up from 2,835 TPS, driven by Base (1,716 TPS), Arbitrum (1,201 TPS), and other Layer 2 solutions. Projections highlighted in our quick bite article indicate potential growth to over 10,000 TPS on Ethereum mainnet and over 1 million TPS within the Ethereum Ecosystem. * Analysing the impacts of Base lower gas targets (33% vs. 50%) increased monthly transactions by 20% (300M to 360M), though active addresses decreased from 30M to 16M. DeFi transactions grew, and NFT activity rose, suggesting a shift toward organic user engagement. * World Chain Active Addresses: Surged to a record 120,000 (+58% daily), fueled by Polymarket’s mini-app launch. We will be updating this metric to include user operations, this figure is currently under-reported. Adoption Metrics * Ethereum Stablecoin Supply: Grew to $173 billion, a $5.5 billion weekly increase (+96% year-over-year), with mainnet leading adoption, bolstered by its consistent uptime. * Starknet Stablecoin Growth: Reached $140 million, a 63% increase in 30 days. * Superform Transaction Growth: Recorded a 1,000% increase in weekly transactions (10,000) and a 258% rise in active addresses (2,800), primarily on Arbitrum One. * Robinhood Tokenized Stocks: Tracked 489 stocks with $8 million in onchain value, showing steady inflows and growing interest in real-world assets (RWAs). * Shopify on Base: Maintained consistent daily volumes via the Commerce Payment Protocol, signaling Web3 integration in e-commerce (search “Shopify” on our platform for details). * a16z State of Crypto Report: Highlighted crypto’s maturation, faster chains, and DeFi mainstreaming, with our data featured prominently. Community and Ecosystem Discussions * Polygon PoS Classification: A community poll showed two-thirds support for including Polygon PoS in the Ethereum ecosystem. Our founder emphasized open dialogue with Polygon, with internal discussions on improving classification. (Noting that on reddit less people were in favour) * GG24 Interop Round: With less than two days remaining, over $100,000 in matching funds support open standards and infrastructure. * Octant Epoch 9: Top donors supported projects include ZachXBT and TheRageTech. Additional Notes * Jovay Network by Alipay: TPS tracking is live. * Ethereum Reliability: Maintains 100% uptime (for over a decade) despite outages on AWS. * Branding Note: Our platform is styled as “growthepie” (lowercase).

c_nl2q5b7,We understand that each mining rig is an individual unit. And that a block will be mined by the rig that gets a valid hash.

c_nl2r1r1,"I agree so when someone says ""solo block found"" it is misleading and not helpful because every block is a solo block. Also see people do it every time it says ""unknown miner"" they say the same thing - there is no way to know if that is a single person or not. and even when people are a ""solo miner"" they are still sometimes part of a pool. The only person that would truly know if it is a single miner that hit the block and thus gets the full reward is the miner themselves - unless they publicly state it as so. I know groups of 10-20 guys who pool cash and rent miners on MRR and then ""solo"" mine on CK - everyone goes ""oooh ahhh! a solo block! that guy is lucky! and its really 20 or so guys that are splitting the reward.

c_nla5th1,"Let me tell you the future. Having a paper/hardware wallet will be uncommon, only a few nerds across the world will host their tokens by themselves. The reason: it is risky and inconvenient. For the same reason, nearly nobody nowadays runs their own email server although this is how the free internet was designed. Instead, all banks will host your tokens in a section of your account the same way they host your euros, dollars, stock shares in different sections already. More convenient than taking care of crypotographic keys with the fear of losing everything by mistake: all you need is a fingerprint to access your bank app and a SMS to confirm transfers. Ethereum will not replace traditional transaction networks, it will exist as an additional option. For example, nowadays in Europe, to send money from our bank account, we / the bank choose between SEPA, Swift, and even sometimes a national network (example: MB Way in Portugal). Ethereum, DeFi and all apps will all exist as they do now but instead of using wallet extensions like Metamask on various websites that you bookmarked, you will simply have a collection of safe apps selected by your bank accessible _from_ your account. Ethereum will be an infrastructure between banks that clients can use from their accounts, just existing as an option besides the legacy infrastructure, and only some nerds will use it directly without the help of their bank. !RemindMe in 5 years PS: Kraken, Coinbase and so on are working to become banks in addition to their traditional exchange service.

In the UK, each chunk of money in an account is guaranteed up to £85K by the government in case of individual banks going under (typically people who wish to hold more FIAT have it across multiple banks/savings accounts as a result).

c_nlfdzlj,This greatly depends on your goals and mentality. If you are someone chasing real money and when I say real money i mean multi millions you will have to go all in on something now rather you choose bitcoin or not is up to you. Contrary to popular belief that is how fortunes are built. If you are in the middle class getting a 10% average return on your diversified portfolio over a lifetime you will not build a fortune. You may be able to retire relatively comfortable for 10 years or so but you will not create real wealth. For example John D Rockefeller was in a stable profitable produce business when people started getting into the oil business. He convinced his business partner to ditch the produce business and go all in on oil which at the time was extremely volatile like crypto but John could see it was the future so he went all in. Again this is completely based off of your mentality and goals. If you are someone who wants to live a comfortable life with a nice retirement maybe do 10% to 15% bitcoin and the rest S&P 500 and you should do fine. If you want a shot at a fortune in this current time bitcoin or crypto for that matter may be your best bet.,2025-10-26 05:26:49,Smooth-Music2304,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit

I am old enough to remember when you had to trace the source code to get answers about the jsonRPC because no one kept the docs up to date...

For that both thank you ( since it might help me train engineers ) and f you for making my brain worth fewer dollars... kidding... but great work.

c_nl8rirw,"I just checked and you lied. I couldn't believe it at first, but we also have an admin panel which we give to the organization to check chat analytics. Man, this is so bad!! The answer that was provided was this \`\`\` The query references ""EIP-291032,"" but the provided context primarily discusses EIP-2929 and EIP-2930 around the time they went live with the Berlin upgrade \[3\]. **EIP-2929** provides a way to adjust gas pricings for trie-dependent opcodes in a backwards-compatible manner to mitigate DoS vulnerabilities. This was achieved by raising costs only for trie accesses that had not been accessed previously in the current execution context, leading to only a sub-percent increase in net costs \[2, 3\]. EIP-2929 was developed alongside EIP-2930 \[3\]. **EIP-2930** is a companion EIP to EIP-2929 that allows callers to specify and pre-pay for certain storage slots that will be accessed later during execution. By charging this cost upfront, it makes the increased cost from EIP-2929 un-noticeable during execution \[2\]. Other EIPs mentioned that relate to gas costs or state access include: * **EIP-1884** (activated in Istanbul) which unconditionally raised costs for SLOAD, BALANCE, and EXTCODEHASH due to trie access costs \[9\]. * **EIP-150** (activated in Tangerine Whistle) which aggressively raised certain gas costs to protect against DoS attacks known as the ""Shanghai attacks"" \[9\]. Given the context provided, there is no specific information detailed for an EIP numbered **291032**. \`\`\` Since it is a developer copilot where people learn, it assumes that you can mistype and hence it provides alternatives.

c_nl92hk1,"Since Cardano is making things from scratch to make smart contracts and tokens and staking work the much better UTxO way, like bitcoin. Which has a huge advantage over account model by being deterministic and parallelizable, which can be better than concurrency. Everything is being built from scratch, because it's the first chain building things this way. It actually needs to be developed instead of copying something that already exists. For example, one cool thing that is about to come out is DeFi actually built to leverage the full potential of Cardano's structure: DeFi is not that good yet on Cardano because the DEXes are just translations of LPs from the account model, which is very inappropriate for an eUTxO model like Cardano. Since eUTxO is deterministic instead of concurrent, it requires batchers to make LPs work, who take pretty hefty fees to just ensure your swap will happen. The right way is the upcoming p2p order book DeFi, the correct way to do DeFi on eUTxO, which will turn the user's transactions themselves into limit and market orders interconnection all the liquidity into a blockchain wide order book. And then you can do some real magic that is so much better than what LP can do. You could make 100 swaps in a single transaction, in a parallelizable way, and with NO BATCHERS, meaning also no batcher fees. And since the tokens are native, transacting them is as cheap and simple and safe as just sending ADA itself (unlike the ERC kind of tokens). P2P eUTxO DeFi could become the most powerful and cheapest to use form of DeFi in the ecosystem (the opposite of what it's now with these batching LPs), and most deterministic, with the least possibilities to fuck your swap over like making it fail or front run it, or having to connect the wallet to some shady dApp (as p2p it would work directly on chain right inside your wallet). The orders will be happening right between the wallets of the two parties that are trading, no coins would even be held somewhere outside your wallet, even multistaged swaps could be atomic. And all the limit order liquidity you might offer would still be inside your wallet, you could even keep staking it in your own custody while offering it as liquidity. That could attract a lot more liquidity than noncustodial LPs. Such a kind of DeFi just sounds too perfect. And that's just one example of how well thought out a single feature on Cardano can be, everything else follows similar patterns, like Cardano already has the best implementation of staking in the ecosystem, being simple, custodial, not locking, not slashing, and having extremely decentralizing mechanics making it have a ton of independent stake pools. It's full of tech that REALLY puts the user first. And the cogs are still being put into the place to create a masterpiece of an engine. It's trying its darn best to build the best and safest possible user experience, it should deserve people flocking to it, yet people blame it for people not using and buying it enough.

c_nl96d8p,"I was/am pretty much in the same boat. I thought Cardano was a promising chain, but then I realized it kept on promising and not making meaningful deliveries (at least deliveries I thought were important). As a DeFi focused person, the main things I cared about were DeFi liquidity, stables, scalability (fast & cheap), open source, truly permissionless DeFi, and the chain being sufficiently decentralized. In 2021/2022, I gave Cardano the benefit of the doubt since its DeFi was young. After some years though, I started to become disillusioned with Cardano since things didn't change (still had lower liquidity/stables, relatively slow and expensive, and the main ""dApps"" were still closed source and used centralized batchers and oracles), or if they did, it was mediocre at best. So I starting using other chains. They were faster (in both time to inclusion and finality), cheaper (a few cents at most, usually less), had orders of magnitudes more in stables and had more overall liquidity, and, most importantly, had DeFi that was open source and actually permissionless. Some of these chains I considered ""sufficiently"" decentralized as well. Cardano prides itself on correctness, peer-review, methodical approach to R&D, UTxO, functional programming, etc. Most of that is great, but at some point being way too theortical and way less practical (as well as the constant ""soon"", ""it's coming"", ""will be"", ""still in development"", ""about to come"") starts to become old, and not just to me, but to many people in crypto. Theory is important, but it alone doesn't mean anything if nothing is delivered and users are left constantly waiting or just unsatisfied. Cardano did not learn that lesson, and I'm not sure it ever will. I moved on from Cardano and sold my ADA. Many others have as well. Some may not come back, even if Cardano changes.

Legit meme coins like toshi, turbo, pengu that are on big exchanges are safer (still a risk) but not a super high chance of getting rugged like you would if they are not listed on good exchanges. I believe places like Coinbase vet these projects for red flags before listing them. My personal rule of thumb is only to get meme coins that are listed on coinbase.

c_nluma8g,"I also recently took out a Morpho loan on Coinbase (this is going to sound like we're shilling Coinbase/Morpho, we aren't, it just has lowest interest rate right now. I would have preferred Ledn or Strike, all else equal). As you said, compared to prior loan processes I've been through (mortgage, HELOC that we didn't end up using), it was just ridiculously simple and fast. Bitcoin as collateral is so clean, and you bypass the process of your entire financial life being dissected, which is never pleasant even if you have perfect credit. I took out a very small loan, mainly as an experiment, and to get a better feel for how this works. The tiny amount of interest is worthwhile as tuition. I will use it pay some living expenses and use the excess liquidity to bump my DCA rate. I went with a 30% LTV, so liquidation price is \~$40k, and there's plenty of Bitcoin in the unlikely event I need to add collateral. Anyway, thanks for going through this. It seems there's a lot of kneejerk negativity toward anything related to loans or leverage with Bitcoin. There is a massive difference between depositing Bitcoin to earn yield, going leveraged long, and what you outline here. It's basically a HELOC, but easier and with Bitcoin. This is going to be an increasingly important tool as more people store their wealth in Bitcoin. I believe rates on these loans will come down with time, so when/if I actually need a larger loan, I'll be ready.",2025-10-28 17:12:40,Live_Jazz,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit

By the end of 2016 the price had risen to $1,000. At the beginning of 2017 I was able to borrow $10,000 again for my 14 Bitcoin (70%) and bought another 10 Bitcoin. At the end of 2019 the price rose to almost $4,000 and I was able to raise another $57,000 (70%) and buy Bitcoin again. This continued and today I have 163 Bitcoin and $468,000 in debt. The Bitcoin is currently worth around $16 million. Bitcoin would have to fall below $3,000 for me to break even. I will continue this system until I reach $1 billion and then retire.

Even on Coinbase the taker fee is ""only"" 1.2%. Then ACH from Kraken to checking is free and takes 1-2 business days. This is better and faster than having an international client wire you money and it having to go through a correspondent bank ($15 wire fee + $25 correspondent bank fee). And that's actually going to take 2-3 business days rather than the 1-2 hours maximum for a bitcoin transaction to settle + the 1-2 days for ACH.

Last cycle everyone said it was over. No 4 year cycles anymore. I was just like you thinking the cycle wasn’t a thing. When crypto went down 20% in a day everyone said it will recover. They are just shaking out the weak. Then it went down another 40%. I held all my crypto because I couldn’t sell now I went from 100k to 40k in a week or so. It kept going down till my 100k portfolio was worth a whopping $9000. Instead of being up 10x I was down a couple hundred. I listened to all the people telling me not to sell as I got dumped on by probably the same people that were telling me to hold. I’m holding my BTC through it now because I know it will recover no matter what. But this is also why I will never hold another Altcoin past the 4 years cycle. As soon as it dumps I taking profit.

Bitcoins a little over 2 trill. from 60k to 120k is only roughly about 1.25trill. taking today's market cap by 5 is about 11.5 trillion. Meaning you'd need roughly 9 trillion more to reach that cap. You'd need 19 trill to reach 1 million a coin and you'd need 420 trillion to reach 20 million . The entire world's estimated wealth is between 400 and 500 trillion.

c_nlpqvak,"Bitcoin's prevailing price isn't a result of its market cap. It's a function of current supply and demand. If supply dried up now (almost all holders don't sell) and demand spiked suddenly now (many new buyers), the current price would suddenly spike massively. Although it is unlikely that there would be so little supply and so much demand to push the price to $1m today, it's a mathematical possibility. The same applies to $10m / $100m.",2025-10-27 22:00:21,n8ivblu,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit
c_nlpdmy5,"I'm not making a case for the figures well into the 7 figures, or even 8 figures, by the early 2030s. However, let's take the global net worth of 400-500 trillion. Let's say the global net worth increases at a rate of 4%, in 2024 it went up 4.6%. That's approximately 16-20 trillion dollars per year with this slightly more conservative estimate. If BTC continues to soak up some of this liquidity, it's not all that difficult to see this asset continue to perform incredibly well in the coming years. The biggest thing it has going is it's scarcity. People now view this asset as something to HODL and we already are at approximately 95% of the total supply, with slightly more than 1 million remaining to be mined. Between Michael Saylor, BlackRock and other ETFs and possibly even nations states the demand is going to be insane. The U.S government even want's to hit a BTC reserve of 1 million coins. While I think the BTC reserve will be created, I do NOT think the U.S is going to hit this target number. Even a country like Kazakhstan is looking to do something similar, can you imagine what it will be like when this happens collectively on the global level? Another question is if the U.S government decides to back the $ with Bitcoin and other commodities, which is actually something that has been openly discussed on the political stage. Hell, the Russian economic minister openly accused the U.S of having a plan to use crypto to address the debt issue. This is more speculation, but it's something to consider in addition to the BTC reserves by nation states.",2025-10-27 20:53:32,ubermensch1001,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit

c_nl8ci2e,"You're aiming to turn HEGE into a real ""brandcoin."" What steps are you taking to make it a solid brand that lasts, besides the awesome artwork? To me, and im sure to many many others, it still comes across as a memecoin dressed up as a brand, not something totally on its own. Going viral isnt really easy to plan, but if you want everyone to know about it - not just crypto fans, what makes my dad want to rock a HEGE shirt? The DAO is cool for keeping the community involved, but bringing in new people feels like the real challenge. Stuff like Reddit and social media are obvious places to start, but memecoins have a little bit of a reputation you have to beat... So, who's your main crowd? People who hate memecoins and need convincing? Total newbies who've never touched crypto? Or just more people already in crypto? I'm not sure what angle you're going for. Its not like HEGE already has the brand recognition to leverage, so it needs to be built somewhere; what makes HEGE special—its story, what it does, or the designs—that could get people talking about it even if they're not into crypto?",2025-10-25 01:37:14,zombiechickenhd,comment,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

c_nl8tm4m,"Pretty good questions tbh. Constructive as well. I’m not part of the team but I’ve been in Hege a while so I’ll take a stab. Personally I think people who hate memecoins already are not a good target, although I would say that Hege stands in the face of everything most memecoins are. Most memecoins are a fart in the wind, but Hege has built a real community of people who genuinely believe in it and ultimately have fun. Generally, for memecoins to succeed there does need be some backdrop of a good market, but the value of building something consistently during downturns is that a spark could set things off at any time, and also when the market does return that people have that trust already there and can see the track record and the brand. Overall, memecoins are not an easy space to me in and can be fickle, but out of all memes out there it’s hard to deny Hege is one of the best out there, and one of the only authentic coins/communities. Even memecoin haters would have to admit that in my opinion",2025-10-25 03:27:17,Advance-Important,comment,cryptocurrency,,Reddit
c_nlh447b,"Great questions!! I've been around the community and invested in Hege for a long time, so I'll also share my takes. For Hege's target audience, my opinion is the biggest untouched potential is for people who haven't been involved in crypto yet as well as those already involved.. Honestly theres potential for people who dont like memes as well, as Hege has always been a part of the underdog story and trying to help all those out there succeed against the Hedgefunds and market manipulators out there by joining the Hege-fund, but I just think theres less potential in this area. Personally, Hege was one of the first coins I got involved with as a newbie in crypto, mainly due to the uniqueness of the story, the characters backgrounds, and the fun the community was having (regardless of the MC). I think its relatable to most normies, and during the next big retail push I think Hege has an excellent shot at gaining a LOT of new crypto investors. The team has constantly expanded the brand into merch, nfts, art, new memes, tiktok and YouTube shorts, games, etc.. all the key elements are in place and keeping Hege on everyones minds even in the weak market. During the next big retail push the team has lots of marketing funds in place to leverage all this content and really on board lots of new investors when the market really starts to push (with any luck Nov and Dec). And there's unlimited potential since the company owns the IP, think cartoons, movies, etc... With the new DOA, it's also much easier for the investors to help steer the direction of Hege for many future cycles to come. Those are just some of the reasons im super bullish on Hege and think lots of normies will be too.",2025-10-26 14:43:26,Flashy_Camera8109,comment,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

The Chinese central bank has been selling treasuries and buying gold, in an amount also likely under-counted, and they have attacked bitcoin before. They've established the largest physical gold trading exchange in the world, which they could easily seize, just as the US has done.

Lots of other bitcoin is exposed at the moment though. It's not clear to me how the global process works to move forward on quantum-resistant crytography. I may well just be ignorant, and it's all moving smoothly, but it seems more likely to me the Chinese government will secretly develop the first quantum computer capable of breaking Bitcoin's encryption, and we're all waiting for IBM or Google to tell us there's a threat, when they can't possibly know.

That's useful but it comes with tradeoffs in proof size and verification time. For most practical applications SNARKs or STARKs are still faster overall even with the setup overhead. Our clients building ZK systems care more about prover time than verification speed because generating proofs is the bottleneck. If GKR makes proving faster for specific types of computations that's valuable, but it's not replacing existing ZK tech across the board. The scalability claims depend heavily on the specific computation being proven. GKR works great for certain circuit structures but performs worse than alternatives for others. It's another tool in the toolbox, not a universal solution. Most of the ZK performance improvements lately come from better hardware acceleration and optimized implementations, not fundamental protocol changes. Getting existing protocols running on GPUs or FPGAs matters more than switching to GKR for most use cases. The hype around every Vitalik post is exhausting tbh. He's smart but the Ethereum community treats everything he writes like gospel when it's usually just consolidating existing research with his perspective on it.",2025-10-25 13:00:36,whatwilly0ubuild,comment,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

c_nl44jkq,"Vitalik's job has always been research into the limits of what crypto systems can do, while maintaining certain desirable properties (like decentralization, permisionlessness, scale, etc.). This research is just an extension of that. In order to scale these systems to the world, you need to find clever ways of making consensus more efficient, and that's where these zk proving systems come into play. The holy grail is being able to prove an Ethereum block fastener than the Ethereum block time (which is ~12s). If you can do this, then every single validator on the network can easily verify that the block was executed properly and according to the network rules. So they don't have to actually keep a copy of the block itself, they just need to store the proof. This makes validation incredibly efficient, and reduces the node requirements considerably. So now you can have a subset of validators responsible for generating computationally expensive proofs, and the large majority just verifying (through math and cryptography) that the blocks are correct. This is how Ethereum scales without compromising on decentralization. In fact, this would increase distribution of nodes and would make the network much more resilient.",2025-10-24 11:49:39,whisperedstate,comment,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

There's a claim that a blameless node operator could be exposed to criminal charges The supposed ""legal issue"" is that the node network is a volunteer operation. Every node operator is independent, and every node contains a copy (or part-copy for a pruned node) of the Bitcoin blockchain. In the early days of Bitcoin, there were discussions about whether every node operator is guilty of possessing and distributing unlawful content if one or more Bitcoin transactions embeds such content. In those old discussion threads, the consensus opinion was that the node operator is not liable The proposal can't work. It's not going to be implemented. Publicly shouting lame misconceptions about the proposal's justifications is pointless Logic If a Bitcoin node operator might be liable for unlawful material on his copy of the blockchain, and if it's necessary to change Bitcoin to eliminate this risk, then the change must completely prevent the storage of unlawful material The BIP444 proposal does not prevent the storage of unlawful material. It's a ""we gotta be seen to be doing something"" proposal which tweaks a couple of Bitcoin script opcodes and parameters. The tweaks only invalidate one current method of storing arbitrary data in a txinput scriptSig, and impose a consensus limit on the OP_RETURN txoutput The obvious indication that the proposal is a failure is that it's proposed to have a 12-month expiry - supposedly to give us enough time to work out a proper solution.

c_nlj3xo6,"Okay so for a start, I will say i am by no means a knownitnall with bitcoin. There is alot I still need to brush up on, but honestly with bitcoin knowledge is power. Educate yourself on the economy, macro economics. Spend time studying bitcoin so you understand thoroughly what it is you whare investing is. The mistake alot of people in is investing in something they dont understand. This means that as soon as a 30% drop comes, they panic, whereas if you have thorough belief in what you invest in, youll see that dip as a major opportunity, and instead of dread and regret, youll use it as a shot at further improving you position for long term success. Its that exact robustness and commitment to bitcoin which is essential to long term wealth building. In terms of my bitcoin journey, I placed about 800 USD in back when bitcoin was around 27k USD per BTC. Left that for about a couple of years which became about 3700USD. This initial gain is what sent me onto my investment journey. Like I mentioned, I worked hard through the summer and made about 6k GBP (approx 8k USD). This was inititially intended for a car, but instead took a leap and lumped all of that into BTC when it was about 55k per BTC. With btc now being at 113k, that investment has already well paid off, but now, after self educating about btc, I realise that im not withdrawing that until im well into my 40s atleast. Im currently 25 so will have about 20 years of time to allow it to do its thing. I now DCA (Dollar cost averaging) which is essentially investing a set amount every set time period, regardless of price. This helps to over time, negate alot of the wild price swings (up and down) that BTC will go through. Since my 6k lump sum, I now only DCA about 30 GBP per week. You can do as much or as little as you like. I now store my BTC in a hardware wallet with my recovery phrases secure. I would recommend as you become more serious about BTC, it means you are the sole owner of your BTC. When you store it on an exchange, its essentially them holding it going ""you own this"". Instead when you have yoir own hardware wallet, you have full controll over your btc, along with your keys being stored totally offline, away from hackers. That being said, with you beig the sole owner of your btc means any mistakes CAN lead to losses such as using incorrect wallet addresses, falling for dusting attacks, but aslong as you are vigilant, educate yourself and understand how it works and what its doing, and you check wallet addresses (which your hardware wallet will make you do anyway) you will be absolutely fine :)) In terms of how much btc to own, as soon as you have bought 0.0001 btc, youre ahead of 92% of the population, so well done!. Keep stacking bit by bit. The amount ofbl btc to own is subjective. Its different for everyone. I myself now hold about 0.17, and im very happy with that, but I know alot of people hold more, but alot of people hold less. We are all on our own journey, what matters is we are all on the same train. And there is only one place we are going brother 🚀🚀🌛",2025-10-26 20:47:37,TripsterX,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit

c_nlfvlg3,"Fair take but I’d look at it a bit differently. Every major technological shift starts with hype before utility catches up. The internet in the 90s was full of scams and speculation too, but the infrastructure that came out of that era ended up changing everything. Right now crypto still feels early and noisy, but there’s genuine innovation under the surface. Stablecoins already move billions daily across borders faster and cheaper than banks. Tokenisation of assets, on-chain identity, and decentralised infrastructure are all evolving fast, even if they’re not mainstream yet. Most coins will die off, that’s true. But the core idea of programmable, censorship-resistant value transfer isn’t going away. Hype brings attention, and attention brings capital, which eventually funds real progress. It’s messy, but it’s how big shifts usually start.",2025-10-26 08:14:48,jemook,comment,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

This was well conveyed with the infamous ""You'll own nothing. And you'll be happy."" So what's your choice? If you can't afford a house or own anything, you'd rather put money into something. And it should be something that can give you the hope of, in the future, getting a roof on top of your head (or whatever you value). Stocks potentially do that but in a very long-term horizon (30 years of compounding at least?). Newer generations are used to 30s videos and 1-click checkout, it's a different type of expectation. It seems that more and more people (especially the youngest, i.e. future leaders in whatever capacity) see that hope in crypto.

c_nlazkua,"Crypto isn't meant to be a mere payment tool or the equivalent of a new *foreign* currency. Bitcoin functions as a monetary network, a store of value, and a decentralized settlement layer all in one. It’s less about competing with Visa and more about creating a censorship‑resistant, non‑sovereign financial system that operates without central intermediaries. The fact that you can built payment systems on top of it is just another aspect of Bitcoin, as programmable money (basic smart contract). It's far superior to other currencies in this aspect because they require external centralized systems (like Visa and MasterCard) to fulfill this role (which in turn gives them a lot of control...and we see them abuse it, censoring all kind of activities by banning them from their services). Ethereum pushes this even further. Its utility goes well beyond trading as it enables smart contracts, DeFi, tokenized assets, games, and even on‑chain governance systems. Billions in value are locked in DeFi protocols enabling lending, borrowing, and synthetic assets without banks. These are financial tools that are more than just ""payments"", they help building/financing/governing businesses.",2025-10-25 14:15:58,diradder,comment,cryptocurrency,,Reddit

c_nlp9niq,"Strategy Inc Assigned 'B-' Issuer Credit Rating; Outlook Stable. For anyone interested: [ * Strategy Inc (formerly named MicroStrategy Incorporated) is a bitcoin treasury company that uses proceeds from the issuance of equity and debt financings to accumulate bitcoin on its balance sheet. The company’s securities provide investors varying degrees of exposure to bitcoin across its capital structure. The company also has a relatively small software business that provides AI-powered enterprise analytics. * We view Strategy's high bitcoin concentration, narrow business focus, weak risk-adjusted capitalization, and low U.S. dollar liquidity as weaknesses. These are only partially offset by the company's strong access to capital markets and prudent management of its capital structure, including maintaining no maturities in the next 12 months and financing its business primarily with equity. * We assigned our 'B-' issuer credit rating to Strategy. * The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Strategy will continue to prudently manage maturities of its convertible debt. We also expect the company will continue to finance payments of its convertible debt and preferred stock dividends via issuances of debt, preferred equity, and equity while maintaining sufficient capital markets access.",2025-10-27 20:33:13,Frequent_Optimist,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit

About 1,000-1,500 x better odds than lotto before you factor in that the Bitcoin lotto runs about 1,008 times a week versus the mega at twice a week... So break it down.

If Percolator can deliver on speed, liquidity, and UX, it could be a serious contender. What's interesting is the timing: Solana's hitting peak performance with recent upgrades (P-Token, increased CU limits), which means the infrastructure can actually support high-frequency trading at scale. The question isn't whether the tech can handle it—it's whether they can attract liquidity and traders away from established platforms. Competition with Hyperliquid will be fierce, but the key differentiator is Solana’s existing ecosystem. Projects already building on Solana (DeFi, gaming, NFTs) can tap into native perps without bridging. That composability is underrated.

c_nljxj6q,What risk exactly. Based of historical events? That's what you have to look at. The third party risk is a bitcoiners outlook. Every crypto has some risk. Even Bitcoin. Just look for a token that staking rewards aren't from inflation but actual profits. There are also tokens you can take and make decent returns. Why let your tokens sit idle. If you need help. Go to grok. Tell it you want it to answer you as a defi expert and ask the same question you asked here. It would be a lot more informative. Also ask grok to answer as a crypto quant. And ask for future projection of your token. Grok is by far best for this. Hope that helps,2025-10-26 23:19:06,jamesvanessa,comment,cryptocurrency,,Reddit
c_nlk3eao,"If a large fraction of market cap is staked, the staking mechanism becomes ""too big to fail."" If it *does* fail, the underlying token will lose most of its value anyway.
