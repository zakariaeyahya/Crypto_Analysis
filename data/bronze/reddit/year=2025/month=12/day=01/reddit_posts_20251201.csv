1pbcwej,"If the near $6,000 drawdown was caused by JP Morgan slamming Saylor...","Why can't Saylor respond more appropriately to ease fears about Strategy. The fact he responded the way he did makes it appear his business is insolvent and he will have to sell Bitcoin to maintain mNAV. Why couldn't he have responded different to try to convey more confidence for his investors?

  
Is Strategy truly in this much deep doo doo that they would have to sell Bitcoin to stay afloat as Saylor has stated? Or is this some sort of headfake to try to trap bears? What's Saylor's angle here?

1p93qnj,Solana Captures 99% Market Share in Tokenized Stocks,"Solana leads the market in tokenized stocks with an astonishing 95%+ market share.

The blockchain has led dominance in the last 4 months, i.e., July to October 2025.

RWA has been a major crypto narrative with fundamentally strong roots.

After the memecoin mania, Solana might make a comeback on the L1 blockchain market.

The reason for Solana’s strong preference among tokenization programs is its high transaction throughput, near-instant finality, and very low transaction costs. Each Solana transaction takes less than 1 second and costs less than $0.001 in gas fees.",https://dascrypto.org/solana-captures-99-market-share-in-tokenized-stocks,emperordas,0,7,0.26,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR solana,reddit_post,1764358065.0,2025-11-28T19:27:45

1p7xacz,Thoughts on Block Times?,"I came across this chart from Chainspect tracking average block times over the last 30 days, and the results are pretty interesting.

We often talk about TPS, but Block Time is arguably just as important for the ""feel"" of a blockchain. It dictates the heartbeat of the network and how responsive dApps feel to the end user.

Interesting takeaways ↓

The Sub-Second Club: It's getting crowded. Aptos is leading the pack with an insane 0.08s, followed closely by Somnia (0.1s) and Sui (0.24s).

L2s vs. High-Performance L1s: It's interesting to see Arbitrum (0.25s) sitting right up there with the parallelized L1s like Sui and Solana.

Solana: Sitting at 0.4s, which is standard for them, but technically slower than the top 5 in this specific metric.

The 2-Second Standard: Chains like Base, Optimism, and Polygon are consistent at 2s. While reliable, the gap between 0.08s and 2s is becoming noticeable in high-frequency trading or gaming use cases.

Does block time matter to you as a user, or do you only care about finality and fees? At what point does ""fast"" become ""fast enough"", can you actually feel the difference between 0.1s and 0.4s?

Let me know what you think.

1p2ql12,"Sharing My Losses since 2021, Beware of ALT","Full Context, I first entered Crypto in 2021 during bullrun. my first purchase was ADA and Doge. and then i learned about Altcoin, Mcap Etc. At that time my smartass thought why purchase Big Mcap coin instead on smaller cap, when big cap might be only 2-3x and smaller one can 10x. even thought i purchase those coin during big correction or bear, fast forward until now I still did not break even most of those coin i loss about 50-85%. Near (-50%), Algorand (-50%), Elgd currently Metaversx (-85%), Vet (-50%), Polkadot (-50%) and Ftm currently Sonic (-80%) in total about $3500 might not big for the west but for asian this is about 10 month average salaries. i have no hope for alt above maybe only for Near (Dev still active sharing with community) and Vet (already have usecase and have break even once before), while the rest I just praying that they can reach close to my entry to cover my losses. and then My Biggest Gain was surprised me, It was My Big mcap crypto. BTC +100% (if i didn't sold early could be 400%), yes Solana +100% crypto that people hate (if i didn't sold early could be 400% too), Eth +300%, and Aave +300%. This is my first time full cycle of bull and bear, I have learned that not to chasing the hype of pump, also managing my risk. I also hope new people can learned from my mistake not to catch falling knives and invest in safest Mcap crypto.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p2ql12/sharing_my_losses_since_2021_beware_of_alt/,WickedHero69,56,93,0.77,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR solana,reddit_post,1763703593.0,2025-11-21T05:39:53
