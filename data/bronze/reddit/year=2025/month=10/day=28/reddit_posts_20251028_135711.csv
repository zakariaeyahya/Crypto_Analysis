The buyback, funded by a Bitcoin-collateralized credit facility, allows the company to repurchase up to 150 million shares, representing 13% of its total shares. Metaplanet holds 30,823 BTC worth $3.5 billion and aims to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027. The program, running until October 2026, seeks to maximize Bitcoin yield per share and restore market confidence.

The weird thing is the buyback is funded by a ""Bitcoin-collateralized credit facility."" Um, is that a third-party? Who? Can they be liquidated if bitcoin price falls? What's the threshold before they run out of capital to service the new debt?

Note that there is no proof that the speed of light is a limit (Eistein only famously postulated it in his 1905 paper), but so far we didn't find a counter example. In quantum mechanics there were 4 postulates that held for a long time until one of them was challenged and proven incorrect (Bender and Boettcher, observables don't need to be represented by Hermitian operators in order to give real eigenvalues as previously postulated). 

Reality has a good track record of invalidating our models, which in truth are only approximations, and also in truth, we humans can't operate in any other way: we postulate, then look for counter exmaples, then refine.

Your last phrase isn't necessarily true. It is inherently based on the idea that a true quantum computer can't happen because an infinite number of states would violate energy finiteness ... but the thing is that ""energy is finite"" is just another postulate about our universe. We haven't even proven whether this universe is finite or infinite. We might be able to prove that we cannot prove it though (like Goedel's famous incompleteness theorems and all their derivatives)",0,t1_nlt1bze,1761650509.0
