Analysts note that easing US inflation and improved US-China relations have provided a cushion for Bitcoin's price. Despite broader economic challenges, including high living costs and national debt, Bitcoin shows resilience. Michael Saylor's company, Strategy, continues acquiring Bitcoin and recently received a B- credit rating from S&P Global, reflecting its efforts in cryptocurrency treasury management amidst market volatility.

The firm highlighted risks tied to bitcoin's market volatility and regulatory treatment, as well as a currency mismatch between bitcoin assets and dollar-denominated debt. Despite these concerns, Strategy's strong access to capital markets and prudent debt management were noted. Future rating changes depend on bitcoin price stability and improved liquidity.

The ability to store arbitrary data on the blockchain has existed since the beginning, and still exists on all Bitcoin-like blockchains - BCH, BSV, LTC, DOGE

A payment script requires data push operators to store the pubkey or pubkey hash in the locking script, and to store the signature and pubkey in the unlocking script. A data push operator can not be constrained against storing arbitrary data  

The BIP444 proposal doesn't remove the ability to store arbitrary data on the Bitcoin blockchain. It only tweaks a couple of parameters. These tweaks are ineffective. They don't make it more difficult to post arbitrary data. They only change the methods

This is true  

But there is a new outlier proposal which seems to have a PR campaign giving it more exposure than it deserves, moving the emphasis to ""but what about the children?"". Search for ""Bitcoin BIP444"". All the usual crypto blog/news sites are running it as a major drama  

Technically, the difference is that the new proposal is a soft fork with a 12-months sunset, as ""let's try this and see what happens"". Ignoring the drama, it's likely to be impossible to revert a soft fork after 12 months without a hard fork, even if the sunset time is hard-coded as a specific future block number  

The previous debate was about relay policy rules - blocking unconfirmed transactions as they traverse the node network in mempools. This ""BIP444"" is proposing temporary changes to consensus rules",1,t1_nlqle94,1761635366.0

Recent optimism around U.S.-China trade talks has improved the ratio, though fears remain. Bitcoin ETF inflows have lagged behind gold ETFs, suggesting potential for catch-up. Bitcoin has gained recently, partly due to gold retreating from its all-time high. Analysts suggest watching for the ratio to break above 30 as a signal of reduced market fear.

However, October's accumulation of 778 BTC marks the slowest monthly purchase this year, down 78% from September's 3,526 BTC. The slowdown is attributed to capital raising difficulties, with equity issuance premiums dropping significantly. Despite reduced buying, Strategy maintains long-term conviction in Bitcoin investments, having spent $19.53 billion on BTC acquisitions in 2025 so far.

However, $115,000 acts as a critical resistance level and potential bull trap zone. A confirmed breakout above this level with strong volume could target $125,000–$130,000, while failure to sustain above it may lead to a retracement toward $90,000. The move follows weeks of consolidation, and volume confirmation will be key to determining whether the breakout is sustainable or a false signal.

Let's all be clueless and irrational  

Everybody kneejerking about ""legal threats"" are only fueling support for this half-baked proposal. There are no threats. There's a claim that a blameless node operator could be exposed to criminal charges  

The supposed ""legal issue"" is that the node network is a volunteer operation. Every node operator is independent, and every node contains a copy (or part-copy for a pruned node) of the Bitcoin blockchain. In the early days of Bitcoin, there were discussions about whether every node operator is guilty of possessing and distributing unlawful content if one or more Bitcoin transactions embeds such content. In those old discussion threads, the consensus opinion was that the node operator is not liable  

The proposal can't work. It's not going to be implemented. Publicly shouting lame misconceptions about the proposal's justifications is pointless  

Logic  

If a Bitcoin node operator might be liable for unlawful material  on his copy of the blockchain, and if it's necessary to change Bitcoin to eliminate this risk, then the change must completely prevent the storage of unlawful material  

The BIP444 proposal does not prevent the storage of unlawful material. It's a ""we gotta be seen to be doing something"" proposal which tweaks a couple of Bitcoin script opcodes and parameters. The tweaks only invalidate one current method of storing arbitrary data in a txinput scriptSig, and impose a consensus limit on the OP_RETURN txoutput  

The obvious indication that the proposal is a failure is that it's proposed to have a 12-month expiry - supposedly to give us enough time to work out a proper solution. We've seen arbitrary data on the Bitcoin blockchain for many years. The proper solution isn't a couple of hopeful parameter tweaks. If it's to be solved at all, it requires an overhaul of the fundamental structure of the Bitcoin block, and to abandon immutability",1,t3_1oha029,1761639697.0

It's too variable . It can be positive while prices drop and negative while they rise, depending on the short/long bias and how extreme the bias is.

Best you could do is an absolute worst case scenario. 0.01% is the typical peak value I see on bybit, it can be worse but quite rarely. 


Get your position size in BTC & multiply as below:

BTC = 0.01% * 3 * no.of days held * position size in BTC

Then convert to USD by multiplying:

USD = BTC * Simple Moving Average (set the length to the number of days you have held the perp). If your trying to predict you obviously wont have this SMA, so again it gets arbitrary, this is just for ur example.

You can adjust this worst case by multiplying by a fraction; what you think will be reasonable for a bull market - maybe theres a way to roughly gauge that.

But in any case, for a bull market , it should be long bias (assume longs are paying shorts for more days of the year than vice versa).",1,t3_1oh407l,1761541548.0

BTC = 0.01% * 3 * 420 * 2

Absolute worst case is that you paid 0.252 BTC holding this perp.

Using the 420 day SMA at march 4 2024, it equals $31,929.91.

So USD = 0.252 * 31,929.91

=$8,046

So worst case you paid about 8k.

Now obviously the funding rate will vary and not always be 0.01%, so you multiply by some number to get the right amount to offset negative settlements or those less than 0.01%, this is where it gets extremely arbitrary.

Say 70% (I just made shit up, but kept long bias)

8046 * 0.7 =$5,632 in fund fees.

1ogwp6f,Can AI fix the human side of crypto governance?,"Bitcoin expert Jimmy Song recently outlined a problem that runs deeper than Bitcoin, one that affects almost every decentralized ecosystem today.

Even in open systems, code often remains centralized. A small group of developers ends up steering direction, while millions of users have little to no real input.

As Song puts it: When developers value different things than users, something has to give. Either you get new developers aligned with users, or users leave.

This is less a technical issue and more a coordination one.
How do you align large, global communities when human consensus doesn’t scale?

Many projects have tried to solve this through voting based governance, but that approach has serious flaws:

1. Code proposals are too complex for most users to evaluate.

2. Voting doesn’t scale, who decides what gets voted on?

3.Hierarchies and political dynamics inevitably form.

4. Expression gets reduced to binary “yes/no” inputs that miss nuance.

In short, even decentralized systems can fall into centralized coordination traps.

Recently, some new approaches have started emerging. One of them from Tau Net, led by Ohad Asor takes a very different route. Instead of relying on voting, it uses a logical AI system that interprets what users mean (in computable language), maps out areas of agreement and conflict and then derives consensus automatically.

Whether or not this specific model succeeds, it raises an important question. 
Can we build governance mechanisms that reflect what communities actually think and want without depending on hierarchy, politics, or mass voting?

It feels like this might be the next frontier for crypto, solving the human side of decentralization.

Is something like this the natural evolution of decentralized governance, or is true user-controlled consensus still a pipe dream?",0,1,0.14,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ogwp6f/can_ai_fix_the_human_side_of_crypto_governance/,1761514569.0,Omegacarlos1,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin,reddit_post,2025-10-27T09:38:33,nlm95x2,AI can not fix the human side of crypto governance,1,t3_1ogwp6f,1761554313.0
1ogsqzh,42% Of Founders Are Building On Ethereum And Base - More Than Every Other Chain Combined. The Multi-Chain Dream Is Evolving Into A Multi-Layer Ethereum Reality,"https://preview.redd.it/k2glh9dq6ixf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9a78ece025a39f8614ef81e330d63a8a09da2cb

As you can see in the image above, the latest data from a16z, it shows something really interesting, 42% of the founders are building right now or planning to build on Ethereum and Base. That is more than every other chain combined.

* Ethereum - 22%
* Base - 20%
* Solana - 16%
* Bitcoin - 8%

This is not just a stat, it is a clear signal of where the next wave of innovation is heading. Ethereum still plays for the long tame and they are trusting its foundation. The liquidity, the tooling and the dev culture are still unmatched.

Then we have base, another success for Ethereum because it is a L2. Base supported by Coinbase is basically building a friendly on ramp into the Ethereum ecosystem in a fast, cheap and normie proof way. This is also attracting developers to work on it.

Solana is not far away from them but in other aspects Solana is really far away from Ethereum ecosystem.

It looks like the multi chain dream is evolving into a multi layer Ethereum reality and base might be the layer that takes it mainstream.

As you can see in the image above, the latest data from a16z, it shows something really interesting, 42% of the founders are building right now or planning to build on Ethereum and Base. That is more than every other chain combined.

* Ethereum - 22%
* Base - 20%
* Solana - 16%
* Bitcoin - 8%

This is not just a stat, it is a clear signal of where the next wave of innovation is heading. Ethereum still plays for the long tame and they are trusting its foundation. The liquidity, the tooling and the dev culture are still unmatched.

Then we have base, another success for Ethereum because it is a L2. Base supported by Coinbase is basically building a friendly on ramp into the Ethereum ecosystem in a fast, cheap and normie proof way. This is also attracting developers to work on it.

Solana is not far away from them but in other aspects Solana is really far away from Ethereum ecosystem.

It looks like the multi chain dream is evolving into a multi layer Ethereum reality and base might be the layer that takes it mainstream.

A significant deleveraging event in October reduced Bitcoin futures positions, while investor focus shifted to defined-risk strategies like options. The valuation gap and stabilized ETF inflows suggest a consolidation phase, with potential for upward movement in Bitcoin's price.

This significant valuation gap, last seen in 2023, suggests a potential deep undervaluation. Analysts believe this could indicate an accumulation phase, with the possibility of a rally as market conditions stabilize. Factors such as reduced leverage, institutional inflows, and a rotation from gold to Bitcoin may drive the cryptocurrency's price closer to its fair value.

It’s a fact

> Bitcoin (and all crypto) has no feature whatsoever that differentiates it from any garden variety Ponzi scheme.

Bitcoin has no relation to a Ponzi scheme at all.

If you think bitcoin does, describe them specifically.

> It's exactly the same concept as a click a button Ponzi app.

I don’t know what app you are talking about nor do I know what concepts are similar to Bitcoin.

> It has no use for anything that isn't already provided better, cheaper and more efficiently by government backed and regulated real money, with myriad protections for consumers via bank and real investment accounts (government backed in case of failure). It generates no revenue. It's only valuable because people buy it at a higher price, that's it.

First of all, this is just plain incorrect.   There are many scenarios where bitcoin is faster/cheaper than using fiat currency (cash) and/or using third party financial products such as checks, Venmo/apps, credit cards, bank wires, etc.

Obviously bitcoin is not the fastest and cheapest transaction method for all transaction types.  There is no single system that has this quality for all transaction types.

Even though you are wrong with your analysis, I don’t see how this has anything to do with your “Ponzi scheme” accusation.


> That price is massively inflated by made up 'stable coins' minted out of thin air by unregulated exchanges set up by criminals. 

I see no evidence of this.  If anything the ETFs show in real time how much demand there is even using a bitcoin investment product.


> A criminal president resides in the White House who manipulates the price daily, facilitating insider trading for his own family and his rich mates to make bank.

This has nothing to do with bitcoin.

Do you also think the stock market is a Ponzi scheme?  Plenty of politicians buy stocks that they know will get favorable legislation.  

For the record I hate all corruption 

> It's a scammer's wet dream, modern day pirates are loving life it's never been a better time to be a scammer.

Again, you are not defining a Ponzi scheme.

I believe a monetary network not controlled by anyone is a benefit to society.  This is why I bought Bitcoin 10+ years ago.",2,t1_nldta9e,1761431588.0

The Fed just gave DeFi a golden ticket, welcoming stablecoins, tokenization, and AI to reshape payments. A new “payment account” could unlock direct Fed rail access for compliant firms. Ethereum’s DeFi dominance is set to soar, and altcoins? They’re not dead, they’re gearing up for a massive comeback.

Fed Governor Waller declared a “new era” where DeFi isn’t the enemy, it’s a partner. Stablecoins, tokenization, and AI are now on the Fed‘s radar, with hands-on research to back it up. A proposed “payment account”, a capped, no frills master account for eligible firms. This means faster fiat, stablecoin swaps, smoother on/off-ramps, and tokenized payments on overdrive. Fed Rails Open Up a streamlined account (no interest, no overdrafts) could slash friction for DeFi players, making rails accessible to innovators.

* Ethereum’s Throne: With \~60% of DeFi’s TVL, ETH’s liquidity, tooling, and institutional heft make it the king of this shift.

The Fed’s pivot is a lifeline for altcoins, but don’t expect an overnight moon. This is a builder’s rally, not a meme coin pump. Smart contract L1s and L2s think Solana, ADA, Polygon, Avalanche, ... stand to gain as DeFi gets regulatory clarity and better rails. Stablecoin and tokenization projects (Chainlink, Polkadot, …) could thrive as tokenized assets scale. Be patient, altcoins need time to align with compliance, build infrastructure, and ride Ethereum’s coattails. The season’s brewing, and late 2025 or 2026 could be explosive for projects that play this right.

Why Not Bitcoin? BTC’s a store of value, not a DeFi workhorse. This is about programmable chains and compliant infrastructure, Ethereum and altcoins are the real winners. The Fed isn’t just okay with DeFi, it’s inviting it to rebuild the payment system.

The Fed just gave DeFi a golden ticket, welcoming stablecoins, tokenization, and AI to reshape payments. A new “payment account” could unlock direct Fed rail access for compliant firms. Ethereum’s DeFi dominance is set to soar, and altcoins? They’re not dead, they’re gearing up for a massive comeback.

Fed Governor Waller declared a “new era” where DeFi isn’t the enemy, it’s a partner. Stablecoins, tokenization, and AI are now on the Fed‘s radar, with hands-on research to back it up. A proposed “payment account”, a capped, no frills master account for eligible firms. This means faster fiat, stablecoin swaps, smoother on/off-ramps, and tokenized payments on overdrive. Fed Rails Open Up a streamlined account (no interest, no overdrafts) could slash friction for DeFi players, making rails accessible to innovators.

* AI + Payments: The Fed’s hyped on AI for fraud, risk, and routing, perfect for programmable L1s and L2s like Ethereum.
* Ethereum’s Throne: With \~60% of DeFi’s TVL, ETH’s liquidity, tooling, and institutional heft make it the king of this shift.

Altcoin Season Is Coming!

The Fed’s pivot is a lifeline for altcoins, but don’t expect an overnight moon. This is a builder’s rally, not a meme coin pump. Smart contract L1s and L2s think Solana, ADA, Polygon, Avalanche, ... stand to gain as DeFi gets regulatory clarity and better rails. Stablecoin and tokenization projects (Chainlink, Polkadot, …) could thrive as tokenized assets scale. Be patient, altcoins need time to align with compliance, build infrastructure, and ride Ethereum’s coattails. The season’s brewing, and late 2025 or 2026 could be explosive for projects that play this right.

Why Not Bitcoin? BTC’s a store of value, not a DeFi workhorse. This is about programmable chains and compliant infrastructure, Ethereum and altcoins are the real winners. The Fed isn’t just okay with DeFi, it’s inviting it to rebuild the payment system. This is the state saying, “Get on our rails, now!” Ethereum’s DeFi giants and scrappy altcoins are ready to seize this moment.

What’s Next? This is exploration, not policy, hold the confetti. But the Fed’s moving fast, and DeFi’s in the driver’s seat. Watch Ethereum, compliant stablecoins, and altcoins building for the long game. Altcoin season is coming, the fuse is lit.

Always be mindful that news can be overhyped. Invest wisely by DCA in during low risk and DCA out during high risk .

He emphasizes that recent volatility is driven by macroeconomic factors rather than Bitcoin's fundamentals. Thorn highlights growing institutional demand and a shift away from Bitcoin's historic four-year cycle, suggesting a more stable market base with lower volatility and passive accumulation. He views the market as being at a pivotal point where sentiment could shift rapidly.

Bitcoin's scarcity, combined with long-term holders reducing available supply, creates explosive price movements during these key days. The article advocates for a 'HODL' strategy and dollar-cost averaging to ensure investors benefit from these rare, unpredictable gains, rather than attempting to time the market.

Bitcoin often topped within 2 months before Fed Chair end of term and, selloff into bear market a month after new Fed Chair or new term. That doesn’t cause the move but those windows come with policy headlines and shifting expectations, which markets react to.

Timeline:

Late 2013 to early 2014 (Bernanke step down Yellen start)

* BTC cycle top: Dec 2013 ($1.2k).
* Chair change: Jan 31, 2014 Bernanke ends, Feb 3, 2014 Yellen starts (2 months after the BTC cycle top).
* What followed: a sharp monthly drop of 32% arrived in March 2014 (1 month after).

Late 2017 to early 2018 (Yellen step down Powell start)

* BTC cycle top: Dec 2017 ($19.7k).
* Chair change: Feb 3 to 5, 2018 Yellen ends, Powell starts (2 months after the BTC cycle top).
* What followed: another steep monthly selloff 33% in March 2018(1 month after).

Late 2021 to mid 2022 (Powell term renewal)

* BTC late cycle high: Nov 2021 (\~$69k).
* Chair milestone: first term ended on Feb 5th 2022 (2.5 months); second term was delayed and confirmed on May 2022 (during the shift to rate hikes/QT).
* What followed: the bear market accelerated into a 37% red candle June 2022( again 1 month after).

Why the Fed Chair Matters for Bitcoin:

The U.S. dollar dominates global finance, used in 88% of transactions and 59% of reserves, making the Fed’s monetary policy a key driver of Bitcoin’s price. The Fed controls liquidity via interest rates and QE/QT. Loose policy boosts risk assets like Bitcoin, tight policy suppresses them. Inflation fears also fuel Bitcoin’s “digital gold” appeal. The Fed Chair leads the FOMC, setting policy tone and expectations. A new Chair in 2026 could signal policy shifts, impacting Bitcoin’s volatility. While Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, its trading environment is fiat driven, tying its cycles to Fed actions.

Future Outlook:

Powell’s second term ends May 23, 2026. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could peak around Feb or March 2026 (2+ months prior), potentially followed by a bear market in June 2026, marked by a 30\~40% correction. However, external factors like regulation or global events could shift timelines.

my risk metric isn’t flagging a hot zone (80-100) for Bitcoin this cycle yet, we might still have time. Currently BTC 110k = risk 48 over 100.",8,4,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oeim8n/bitcoin_cycles_fed_chair_timelines_no_crystal_ball/,1761262368.0,hduynam99,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin,reddit_post,2025-10-24T07:13:52,nl3bq34,"I made a post on here recently basically stating that I could see the actual top go into Q1 of 2026. A lot of the crypto bros this cycle seem to really be obsessing about the 4 year cycle having a top that is within a very specific time from, I've seen it from both the halving AND from the bottom. Based on this, we would have topped by now, which I think is highly unlikely. Last cycle, we actually peaked spring of 2021, which did not invalidate the 4 year cycle. 

We recently had the biggest liquidation even in crypto history not too long ago, which would have been an equivalent of the COVID scare March 2020 and the collapse in the market after the collapse of FTX in November of 2022. There was heavy fear in the market, yet BTC is/was still trading above 100k. In addition to this, we have a wave of ETFs that will soon be approved, more rate cuts and the start of QE sometime in the near future. It just doesn't make much sense for us NOT to have another leg up or for us to have already topped and be in the early stages of the bear market. 

I think BTC has already had the vast majority of it's gains for this cycle, but I think the huge action will be with the alts, which still really haven't been doing much overall. 

I think the reason why people are so fearful/bearish is because they were overexposed to alts, most likely bought at incorrect moments in this cycle, while being underexposed to BTC.",9,t3_1oeim8n,1761286432.0

This growth highlights their increasing role in cross-border transfers and treasury operations. Stablecoins are now integrated into payment systems, supported by regulatory frameworks like the U.S. GENIUS Act. Their adoption benefits Bitcoin and Ethereum by enhancing liquidity, reducing volatility, and increasing network activity. Future growth depends on policy, distribution, and reserve strategies, potentially expanding their share of global payments further.

# Crypto Futures | Warning, Warning!

You already read the warning above and understand that this is not financial advice at all. In fact, this goes beyond warning, and I request you not try it if you haven’t ever tried the Futures market.

https://preview.redd.it/xx6h8vd0lvwf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1194a8db82120229ba003239d9fb8448f286dd14

For your information, I lost USD 20,000 before I even understood how Futures work. Then I lost another USD 1,200 (in INR) on CoinDCX (Indian Crypto Exchange) before I got an idea of how to get it right in Futures. So, I urge you not to try this if you have no clue what the Futures market is all about.

Now that the warning is out of the way, let’s dive straight in.

https://preview.redd.it/r3fv9842lvwf1.jpg?width=1189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2ed4b284cad0a23dfb5442c34a399dbe70e19a5

# To The Futures Players | And the Stalwarts | And the Veterans

So, I keep playing in the Futures market on CoinDCX, and I have some investments on GateIO. I trade on GateIO and play Futures on CoinDCX. In both cases, BTC is common.

Here is something interesting I observed:

1. The price of BTC on GateIO is 50-100 dollars higher than on CoinDCX. I presume this is due to the Exchange’s formulae of averaging the price of BTC on the major exchanges.  
2. Whatever the case, at any given point in time, the difference is at least 50 USD.  
3. And when the price is fast-moving, the difference goes up to 100 USD. I am yet to witness a bigger difference than this. So, safely assume it is between USD 50 and 100.  
4. Now, the regular trader may think of arbitrage, but I don’t think arbitrage will work that fast, or maybe it will with bots. I don’t know, and it is not something I am interested in. You can still check it out. But there is something more, and that is the fun part.  
5. If you are a Futures player who plays scalping or day trading, then you are always asking the question of which direction the price is moving.  
6. However, if you are both on CoinDCX and GateIO, then you can look at the price on GateIO, and whatever the price is, you know the price on CoinDCX is going to be 50 to 100 USD less.  
7. You can look at the direction of trade (increasing or decreasing) and go and buy a Long or Short contract on CoinDCX.  
8. I recommend trying with small amounts first until you get the hang of it. Once you get the hang, buy Long or Short and close the contract when you achieve 10, 20, or even 50% profit on your position.  
9. It is working like a charm for me, and I am loving it completely.

That’s it. That’s the trick.

# Words of Caution | Be Smart About the Trick

This will not work if you see an extremely fast movement of the Bitcoin price upwards or downwards. Why? Because by the time you buy the contract (Long or Short), the price could have reversed, leading to losses.

I have tried this with Bitcoin, but it should work with any coin/token. I recommend not taking a chance with other tokens if you have no idea of their price movements. Bitcoin is easy. Others may not be.

That’s it. So try it out at your own peril!! 😊

1odvw64,Datasets,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on a project where I need to build an automated system that can determine the price of a cryptocurrency at the exact time a client’s transaction occurred. The idea is simple: for each transaction, take the coin and timestamp, and fetch the corresponding USD price at that moment.

For this, I’m looking for datasets that provide **historical cryptocurrency prices**

* Coin name or symbol
* Timestamp of the price
* Price in USD

Minute-level resolution or better would be ideal, as cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate rapidly. Datasets can be in CSV, JSON, Parquet. It would be great if the data covers a wide range of coins, not just Bitcoin or Ethereum, since client transactions could involve altcoins as well.

If anyone has access to such datasets, whether public, private, or via an API, I’d greatly appreciate it if you could share it. Any tips on working with large historical crypto datasets efficiently would also be helpful.

The goal is to make a system that can automatically take a client’s transaction and return the exact price at that moment, so having accurate historical price data is essential.

Thanks in advance for any help or guidance!",3,3,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1odvw64/datasets/,1761200526.0,Daniyal_Niazi,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin,reddit_post,2025-10-23T09:03:04,nkx73z3,coinmarketcap has this historic data but it's expensive to purchase in bulk.

The study also notes growing interest in crypto investments among younger investors, with regulation seen as key to unlocking broader participation in the market.

3.	⁠Bitcoin could transition to a quantum secure signature scheme SPHINCS+. SPHINCS+ have already been standardised by NIST as a post quantum secure signature scheme so this is a relatively obvious soft or hard fork when the time comes.

This decision, announced by the Ministry of Finance, allows Russian businesses to settle cross-border transactions using Bitcoin. The move aims to bypass Western sanctions, reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar, and leverage Russia's growing Bitcoin mining operations. The policy is expected to impact global trade systems and encourage other nations under sanctions to explore cryptocurrency-based trade solutions. However, concerns about Bitcoin's volatility and regulatory scrutiny remain.

While some analysts predict further retracement, others suggest potential recovery and a surge in Bitcoin's value as liquidity rises for the first time since July.

BlackRock’s IBIT led inflows with $210.9 million, followed by ARK 21Shares’ ARKB with $162.85 million. Despite recent outflows, Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $4.21 billion in October. Bitcoin’s rally reflects shifting investor sentiment amid macroeconomic factors, including potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and easing geopolitical tensions.

Here's a counter point: rate cuts are generally negative for markets because they signal an underlying problem. The economy sucks. But actually that doesn't matter all that much, because altcoins are pretty much worthless from the standpoint of use case. What's the use case of your favorite altcoins? I'd say you've got a small handful that are interesting. The majority of altcoins today are likely to have peaked already, not just this ""cycle"" if you believe in that, but in their history.

You know more? From what? Where's your post? Where's your data? 

Funny enough, if you actually bothered to do any research at all which I know you haven't, you'd know that in 75+% of times when the fed cut rates, asset prices soared unless in special circumstances when there was a hard landing, or those rate cuts were out of pure panic and not expected long in advance (these one were and are expected well into 2026). You can check dot plots from the fed. But I know you didn't and won't because you're typical and average and lazy.

So next time you try to put someone down for thinking they know more than you, make sure you know more than they do, especially when discussing the topic at hand. 

I fully understand the risk of holding altcoins. That's why I said to buy quality altcoins, not dogpoopwifhat coin or whatever it is you're probably thinking of. I wish you the best of luck, and don't say I didn't give you a heads up to buy.

The whale faces a potential $2.6 million unrealized loss if Bitcoin's price rises above $112,368. This move follows significant transfers of Bitcoin to new wallets and exchanges. Analysts view the recent Bitcoin price drop as a healthy correction, while speculative capital increases in the market amid declining investor sentiment.

It's way harder to change Bitcoin than most blockchains because the community is extremely conservative about modifications.

Changes get implemented through either soft forks which are backward compatible, or hard forks which split the network if everyone doesn't upgrade. Soft forks need miner signaling to activate, hard forks need everyone to adopt the new rules or you end up with competing chains like Bitcoin Cash.

For your specific points, Bitcoin adding smart contracts is limited compared to Ethereum. It has basic scripting for things like multisig and timelocks but not general computation. Moving to proof of stake is basically impossible because the community fundamentally rejects it as less secure than proof of work. That's not happening.

Transaction throughput is a real limitation. Lightning Network helps but you're right that it has scaling challenges as the network grows. Our clients building on Bitcoin either accept the throughput limits or use Lightning despite its tradeoffs. Base layer Bitcoin isn't going to 100x transaction speed because larger blocks create centralization.

Quantum resistance is a legitimate future concern but not urgent yet. When quantum computers actually threaten current cryptography, Bitcoin can upgrade signature schemes through a soft fork. The tech exists, it just needs consensus to implement when necessary.

The governance model is intentionally slow and conservative. Major changes take years of debate and testing. Bitcoin's value comes partly from being hard to change, which makes it predictable and resistant to capture by any single group.",1,t3_1ocn0su,1761190394.0

The entire post is stupid but this one is just hyperstupid.

The block subsidy (new coins) is currently 3.125 BTC per block.  Any block with more or less is invalid and will be rejected by all nodes.

Most recent block has a 3.16744483 BTC coinbase transaction (payment to miner). The excess beyond 3.125 BTC is the total of transaction fees.  So one block is higher than your ""estimate"" of daily mined Bitcoins.

Not much actual cryptography is discussed with BTC, just ""number go up means BTC is the best!"" around these parts.


The whole point of keeping BTC as close as possible to how Satoshi's plan worked, is: more complex difficulty + higher fees for miners/validators + becoming slower (full blocks) = more value over time. 


But that plan has started to be deviated from. BTC isn't supposed to be cheaper to send (obviously through L2s, that don't functionally exist), it's not supposed to be super fast (which is suspect from low transaction volume), and it's certainly not supposed to have empty blocks (OTC BTC bought/transacted privately, deviating from BTC being immutable, technically these transactions aren't occurring).


But the crazy thing though is that Satoshi made Bitcoin block sizes adjustable, he was enthusiastic about L2s existing for Bitcoin (which none functionally exist, Lightning can't scale for shit), and Bitcoin blocks were initially private (as no one used it), but became public over time, as more people used the network. 


I won't say any of it is bad, but it throws a wrench in the whole plan. Miners/validators control the network consensus, they don't want change, this is their cash cow (if there is no incentive to mine, there is no incentive to validate), BTC's network already runs horrendously slow during uptimes (especially with Ordinals running in blocks). The more I learn about cryptography in the cryptocurrency markets, the more jaded I become about the future, and how very little networks out there actually care about the future? It's just mass hoarding wealth in another form.

True decentralization. We saw this truth yesterday when AWS went down and other blockchains went down but not ICP. ICP is the blockchain that actually follows through fully on what blockchains can actually do. At some point people will just start fully moving to ICP over big cloud providers. ICP will also lift over blockchains up because they cannot actually achieve what ICP is doing, they’re just ledgers compared to the capability of ICP. I believe ICP is the only actual use case for crypto outside of value based coins. Why wouldn’t you want tamperproof, censorship resistant apps, website, and AI? ICP is the future and that’s a fact.

None of this hedge against inflation crap, if the President of the United States can randomly crash the market from a single tweet! Everything is valued in USD, hence, tied to an inflationary currency, it's hedged against fuck-all. If the US Dollar crashes, BTC is going to crash too, because of how much dependence the market has on the US Dollar/Tech Market value. 


The real use-case is decentralized money, that's about it!

It just can't. There are objective metrics to what makes for a good currency, and there are too many that crypto doesn't meet.

There are some uses cases, like financing unbanked people in remote parts of the world. But those are, in the grand economic scheme of things, too niche to warrant serious large-scale adoption.

Blockchain technology itself does have some use cases. But, and people tend to ignore this one, most problems that blockchain tries to solve can just as (or more) easily be solved without blockchain.

Ultimately, the tech is cool and draws people in, and quite a few crypto nuts are just anti-establishment folk who like the anti-authoritarian angle of decentralization. But if we're talking actual, practical real-world uses, there aren't that many.

Factors influencing the slowdown include profit-taking, tighter budgets, regulatory scrutiny, and a shift toward alternative assets like Ethereum and yield-bearing cryptocurrencies.

1ocacwt,Best Cryptocurrency Online Casinos — What’s Actually Worth Using?,"Cryptocurrency online casinos have exploded in popularity over the past few years. With more people using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital coins for gaming, new crypto casino platforms are launching almost every month. But with so many options, it’s becoming harder to tell which ones are actually worth using.

Every crypto casino claims to offer fast payouts, provably fair games, and anonymous transactions, but once you start playing, the truth often looks very different.

Some of the most talked-about cryptocurrency casinos right now include:

Titantreasure

Jackbit

mbit

Stake

All of them advertise “guaranteed fairness,” “premium bonuses,” and “next-gen blockchain transparency.” But when you dig a little deeper, it’s not always clear how fair the odds actually are, or whether the games are designed to keep you spinning until your wallet runs dry.

A big question in the crypto casino community right now is how transparent and provably fair these sites really are. Most claim to use blockchain verification for their casino games — but do players actually check those proofs, or do we just take the site’s word for it?

It’s also worth looking at how these platforms handle withdrawals and live betting. Some crypto casinos advertise instant payouts, but in practice, delays, withdrawal limits, or extra verification steps are still common. And when you’re dealing with crypto volatility, a delay of even a few hours can make a big difference in the value of your winnings.

I’m genuinely curious, has anyone here actually made consistent profits or had a positive long-term experience with cryptocurrency online casinos? Have you found any sites that truly live up to the “provably fair” promise and make cashing out simple and fast?

Or is crypto gambling more about the entertainment factor, the thrill, the technology, and the community, rather than expecting to walk away ahead in the long run?

If you’ve tried multiple platforms, which crypto casinos do you trust most in 2025? Which ones deliver smooth, fair gameplay. which look great on the surface but disappoint once you start wagering real crypto?

Jackbit

mbit

Stake

All of them advertise “guaranteed fairness,” “premium bonuses,” and “next-gen blockchain transparency.” But when you dig a little deeper, it’s not always clear how fair the odds actually are, or whether the games are designed to keep you spinning until your wallet runs dry.

A big question in the crypto casino community right now is how transparent and provably fair these sites really are. Most claim to use blockchain verification for their casino games — but do players actually check those proofs, or do we just take the site’s word for it?

It’s also worth looking at how these platforms handle withdrawals and live betting. Some crypto casinos advertise instant payouts, but in practice, delays, withdrawal limits, or extra verification steps are still common. And when you’re dealing with crypto volatility, a delay of even a few hours can make a big difference in the value of your winnings.

I’m genuinely curious, has anyone here actually made consistent profits or had a positive long-term experience with cryptocurrency online casinos? Have you found any sites that truly live up to the “provably fair” promise and make cashing out simple and fast?

Or is crypto gambling more about the entertainment factor, the thrill, the technology, and the community, rather than expecting to walk away ahead in the long run?

If you’ve tried multiple platforms, which crypto casinos do you trust most in 2025? Which ones deliver smooth, fair gameplay. which look great on the surface but disappoint once you start wagering real crypto?

1oc9hd5,Quantum Threat to Bitcoin: Overhyped or a Real ticking clock?,"Most people in crypto focus on short-term price moves or the next halving, but there’s a long-term threat that doesn’t get enough attention: quantum computing.

Here’s the thing. Bitcoin’s security relies on elliptic-curve cryptography. That’s what keeps your private keys safe and prevents anyone from forging transactions. The issue is that a powerful quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could, in theory, break ECC. That means it could figure out your private key just from your public key.

We’re not there yet. Quantum computers today aren’t strong enough, but researchers estimate it might take around a million stable qubits to break Bitcoin’s encryption. The scary part is that companies like IBM and Google are already making steady progress toward that.

And here’s what makes it even more interesting: some governments and major banks are already preparing for the quantum threat. They’re quietly transitioning to post-quantum encryption standards ahead of time. Makes you wonder if they know something the public doesn’t.

Then there’s the store now, decrypt later problem. Hackers could already be saving blockchain data, planning to decrypt it once the tech catches up. That could make old BTC addresses and reused keys vulnerable down the line.

So what do you think? Should Bitcoin start preparing for the quantum threat now, or is it still too early to worry about it?

1. Quantum computing is 20-30 years away minimum. 

2. It is only a threat to bitcoin addresses which have revealed public keys. So all you would need to do is send your bitcoin to an address that does not have a revealed public key (an address which has not sent anything) 

3. Bitcoin could transition to a quantum secure signature scheme SPHINCS+. SPHINCS+ have already been standardised by NIST as a post quantum secure signature scheme so this is a relatively obvious soft or hard fork when the time comes. 

Finally, you have cryptocurrencies such as Verus (VRSC) which are quantum ready. Verus uses a hashing algorithm which is based on Haraka v2 which is an underlying hash algorithms for SPHINCS+ signature scheme. Making it even easier to transition to a post quantum world.",3,t3_1oc9hd5,1761124003.0

About 20% of the BTC in existence has the public key directly on the blockchain (not hashed).  And any transaction requires sending the public key.

While TLS and other systems can move to a quantum secure algorithm, Bitcoin’s design and lack of a central admin who could forcibly move older UTXOs or distribute new keypairs, makes it uniquely vulnerable.

It could kill Bitcoin.  Though my guess is there will be a fork and the winning chain will give a time limit for people to move their funds to a new key format and just declare everything not moved to be lost and unspendable.

But a quantum computer that can run Schorr’s algorithm is anywhere from 10 years off to not happening. The grifters in that industry are hyping, something people here should be familiar with.

1oc9hd5,Quantum Threat to Bitcoin: Overhyped or a Real ticking clock?,"Most people in crypto focus on short-term price moves or the next halving, but there’s a long-term threat that doesn’t get enough attention: quantum computing.

Here’s the thing. Bitcoin’s security relies on elliptic-curve cryptography. That’s what keeps your private keys safe and prevents anyone from forging transactions. The issue is that a powerful quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could, in theory, break ECC. That means it could figure out your private key just from your public key.

We’re not there yet. Quantum computers today aren’t strong enough, but researchers estimate it might take around a million stable qubits to break Bitcoin’s encryption. The scary part is that companies like IBM and Google are already making steady progress toward that.

And here’s what makes it even more interesting: some governments and major banks are already preparing for the quantum threat. They’re quietly transitioning to post-quantum encryption standards ahead of time. Makes you wonder if they know something the public doesn’t.

Then there’s the store now, decrypt later problem. Hackers could already be saving blockchain data, planning to decrypt it once the tech catches up. That could make old BTC addresses and reused keys vulnerable down the line.

Because those people don't understand how money works. Bitcoin sucks as a currency.

>Does that not make the fed useless and ultimately prevent them from making any money at all?

No. Reserve asset =/= money in circulation. The purpose of a reserve asset is to provide a base of value so that if people want to trade in another currency for it, they can. Which gives them confidence in that other currency's value.

The US dollar is the world's reserve currency because its value is backed by the stability and power of the US. Other countries' central banks hold US dollars so that their citizens can be confident that if their local currency becomes unstable, they can just trade in their local currency to their government for US dollars.

>Better yet why does any country need a central bank? Cant the govt print and manage its own money?

No, because governments are incentivized to keep spending. Separation of monetary and fiscal policy is essential for a functioning government.",2,t3_1obnv9o,1760981169.0

Banks are not fighting Bitcoin anymore, soon they will be holding and selling it. The rich want an asset to run into in the event of a dollar crash, too. Things can go a moderately good way, even with a dollar crash, if crypto is allowed to be held by banks in a custodial role. It will not be a world ender, just a rather large speed bump.

 And stabelcoins require a 1:1 holding of monies, and allow for treasuries to be bought from the Fed and held in an account, drawing interest, while allowing the creation of an equivalent digital dollar. This paradigm actually staves off a dollar crash longer than not having stablecoins. As it locks up money and allows it to be used in portion actively at the same time. It is quite a genius banking move, you can earn interest on your money for holding it and still allow it to be used digitally at the same time, in essence, creating two dollars out of one temporarily, while guaranteeing a lock up of the original monies. That fights inflation if done correctly, as not all of the 1:1 is used at once, only the proportion that is paid for simultaneously by the customer or end user.",1,t3_1obnv9o,1760987052.0

Isn't it easy to just swim with the majority opinion, you are never short of an opportunity to look down on others. 

1GB blocks have been explored and declared possible today (even a few years back now). People derogatory called it kicking down the can. But in reality that is what everyone does. Chips size, storage size, transistor size, network speed, everything and everyone is kicking down the can.

The 1MB block of 2009 is the 100MB block of today. That's 100x the tx amount. Yet everyone is talking about a trilemma and hasn't scaled even a tiny 2x. And you still believe them that there is a trilemma 🤡

Show me when we ever had a non inflationary currency in history and that it was actually bad.

Dorsey views Bitcoin as money and supports its use as a payment method, citing advancements like zero-fee BTC payments by his company, Block. His stance has reignited discussions about Bitcoin's role and its distinction from other cryptocurrencies.

Technical indicators, including RSI and chart patterns, suggest waning sell pressure and potential for continued upward momentum. Other cryptocurrencies also saw gains, contributing to a 4.6% increase in global crypto market capitalization.

Step 2. take the time to LEARN about how things function before you invest in them.

Step 3. Once you can explain accurately to someone else how something works, learn how to properly secure it, learn about cold storage, paper backups and the importance of self custody, as well as the common scams/risks so you dont fall victim to them

Step 4. Dollar cost average into your projects.

I would recommend staying inside the ""blue chip"" zone with the majority of your funds (IE 10 top coins)

Most balanced profiles have a larger BTC position, with some things like ETH/XRP/ADA/SOL/BNB in addition but in smaller positions.  The Ratio is really up to you.

A basic example of what that might look like


BTC 40%

ETH 15%

XRP 15%

ADA 10%

BNB 10%

SOL 10%

The current resistance in Bitcoin's price is attributed to sell-side pressure from these holders, as indicated by on-chain data showing increased realized profits and revived supply from older coins. Analysts suggest that the transfer of Bitcoin supply from long-term holders to institutional investors is a key factor. Stability around current support levels is crucial for a potential price rally.

Congratz on getting your first hardware wallet. That's the way to go! 

First of all, you don't have many options for a huge amount of BTC. There are mainly 2 established companies that are active in the industry for more than a decade: Ledger and Trezor. 

While Ledger had a huge scandal with a [Potential security flaw](https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/ledgers-recover-feature-sparks-controversy-amid-security-concerns) \- Trezor had flaws in older device & a data breach of 66k users. 

However, both of them are good options to store your Bitcoin. In fact, if I'd be having more than 1 - I'd use 2 devices to be 100% sure. Also, if you're planning to use the hardware wallet actively - it's recommended to have 2 devices: one of daily tasks and one for long term hodling. 

Now, let's get to my personal recommendations : Ledger Nano X and Trezor Model T. 

I've had Ledger devices mostly, and I was pretty dissapointed with Nano S after it got bricked in less than 4 years. But the Ledger X? works like a charm for the past 5 years. 

Trezor Model T is more user friendly imo. Not sure about its lifespan as I've started testing it a few months ago when I started  [WalletReview](https://walletreview.com/) \- which you can check it out. I've wrote more technical details about Ledger Nano X and Trezor Model T, including a comparison between them. 

Imo both are great options, but it really depends on what you prefer. 

PS Remember to only buy from Trezor shop or Ledger shop. Better safe than sorry. And always:

Mt. Gox, the former Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange, is set to complete its creditor repayment process by October 31, 2025, after over a decade of legal and financial proceedings. The exchange still holds approximately 34,689 BTC (worth around $3.9 billion) to be distributed to verified creditors. This follows a series of Bitcoin sales over the years, with significant sales in 2017–2018 that impacted the market. The repayment process transitioned from liquidation to rehabilitation, allowing creditors to receive Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash instead of fiat currency. The deadline was recently extended to ensure all outstanding claims are processed.",10,t3_1ob9n2r,1760932211.0

1oavwdf,Uptober and its seasonal probability,"https://preview.redd.it/dpkv4j0yu3wf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=86d4eac071001ecf76b943909082a7673efcaf01

Let’s cut through the Uptober hype with some cold, hard data. You’ve got a chart of Bitcoin monthly returns and you’re eyeing October. From 2013 to 2024, October closed green 10/12 times (only 2014 and 2018 were red). If this month Oct-2025 closes red, that’s 3/13 about 23% odds of a down month. Nice edge, sure, but not destiny.

The seasonal probability 70/30:

In traditional markets, many calendar effects win around 60-70% of the time over long samples, good, but far from guaranteed. Two well studied examples: the Halloween indicator (“Sell in May”) shows higher Nov-Apr returns across many markets, but not every year, updated research still finds persistence, not certainty. Likewise, the turn of the month effect concentrates a big chunk of average monthly return into a few days, yet it also fails regularly. In short, seasonality is probabilistic, think 70/30, not 100/0.

Reality check:

markets don’t care about calendars, they care about cycles, liquidity, and macro. If we’re in a prolonged consolidation (post-halving churn, shifting policy), that \~23% downside month isn’t some anomaly, it’s the cost of playing a probabilistic edge. The log trend can stay intact while October still prints red.

Bottom line:

Use seasonality as context, not a trigger. Based on my risk metric, BTC $109K = risk 48. It's still under 50 and today is Sunday. I'm DCAing in, sticking to my plan.

From 2013 to 2024, October closed green 10/12 times (only 2014 and 2018 were red). If this month Oct-2025 closes red, that’s 3/13 about 23% odds of a down month. Nice edge, sure, but not destiny.

The seasonal probability 70/30:

In traditional markets, many calendar effects win around 60-70% of the time over long samples, good, but far from guaranteed. Two well studied examples: the Halloween indicator (“Sell in May”) shows higher Nov-Apr returns across many markets, but not every year, updated research still finds persistence, not certainty. Likewise, the turn of the month effect concentrates a big chunk of average monthly return into a few days, yet it also fails regularly. In short, seasonality is probabilistic, think 70/30, not 100/0.

Reality check:

markets don’t care about calendars, they care about cycles, liquidity, and macro. If we’re in a prolonged consolidation (post-halving churn, shifting policy), that \~23% downside month isn’t some anomaly, it’s the cost of playing a probabilistic edge. The log trend can stay intact while October still prints red.

Bottom line:

Use seasonality as context, not a trigger. Based on my risk metric, BTC $109K = risk 48. It's still under 50 and today is Sunday. I'm DCAing in, sticking to my plan.

BTC usually cycles every 4 years and is lower on mid term years. Of course this can break or be wrong so it's still a risk, but would suggest to buy it next year when you can buy 2 BTC for price of one. 


And yes. BTC is a money printing hedge. Land is good. It's a hedge too. Same with gold stocks etc. 


BTC has the unique property that you can't confiscate it and can bring it around easily. (Vs land and gold).


The cons is it's not as proven vs gold and land (gold and land is proven money printing hedge and valuable since ever. BTC has 15 years history or so)


But it's still prudent to have some. The risk means that there is higher than normal reward ",2,t3_1oaviwo,1760896004.0

BlackRock has acquired $60 million worth of Bitcoin through its ETF products, signaling continued confidence in the cryptocurrency despite ongoing market volatility.
