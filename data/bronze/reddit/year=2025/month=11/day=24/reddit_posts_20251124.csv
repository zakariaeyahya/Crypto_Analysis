1p5llbc,Users push trading volume in US stock-linked futures past $5 billion on Bitget,"Even as Bitcoin’s price slump rattles the wider crypto market, Bitget has crossed over $5 billion in cumulative trading volume on its US stock-linked perpetual futures.

The exchange says its integration allows users to fund their accounts in USDT and trade crypto assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL alongside equities including AAPL, TSLA, NVDA, and MSTR, without opening a separate brokerage account. Cash-in and cash-out options include P2P and direct rails where available.

Bitget’s current offering includes stock-linked perpetual futures tied to major companies such as Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, with additional index contracts providing one-tap exposure to broader market and tech baskets.

Other offering for users include Trading Club Championship Phase 18 where users can trade UXLINK and AIA spot and futures daily to earn BGB...

The exchange emphasises that these instruments are derivatives mirroring the price movements of selected US equities, not actual shares, and therefore do not convey dividends or voting rights.

will other CEXs emulate this diversification with stocks?",https://www.citizen.digital/article/bitget-users-push-trading-volume-in-us-stock-linked-futures-past-5-billion-n373407,Green_Candler,7,3,0.89,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764001710.0,2025-11-24T16:28:30

1p5kgda,Companies are staking their SOL and I'm just holding,"Bought SOL at $180 and been holding since. Price goes up, price goes down, nothing really changes. Just sits there.

Saw on Twitter today some EdTech company Classover is running validators with their treasury SOL. They're using the staking rewards to subsidize their platform or something like that.

Made me realize I'm just holding while companies are actually putting it to work. I could stake mine but honestly too lazy to figure out which validator to use and whether it's worth the hassle for the amount I have.

The ironic part is they're probably making more off staking than I am off price movement. And if more companies start doing this instead of just holding like MicroStrategy does with Bitcoin, maybe that's actually better for the network.

Or maybe it doesn't matter at all and I'm just trying to feel better about my bags not moving. Can't tell anymore.

Their stock didn't pump on the news so clearly market doesn't care. But made me think whether I should actually do something with my SOL instead of just waiting for number to go up.

1p4l1go,A Post Mortem: This is why your altcoin died this cycle,"The 2022-2025 cycle was rough for altcoin holders. Even as Bitcoin kept hitting new all-time highs, most altcoins kept bleeding.

People say that money moves from Bitcoin → Ethereum → large caps → small caps → microcaps. But here's the rub: that pattern only really works when interest rates are low and the Fed is doing QE. It DOES NOT apply when interest rates are 4-5% and the Fed is doing QT.

**The 2021 setup: 0-0.25% rates + QE**

In 2021, interest rates were basically zero. Inflation was around 2-3%, so holding cash felt like slowly losing money. So everyone - regular folks and institutions alike - wanted higher returns.

They put money into anything that earned more than 2%. A lot of this money flowed into crypto through DeFi. This pushed up the TVL of nearly every goddamn protocol. It was an era of easy money, so even stupid NFTs could sell for a million bucks.

**The turning point: October 2021 CPI report**

Before the October CPI report, the Federal Reserve kept saying inflation was transitory. On 10 November 2021, we saw a CPI reading of 6.2%. At that point, it was clear inflation wasn't going away. The Fed had to do a full 180 and HIKE BABY HIKE.

That October CPI report was the exact moment that triggered the 2022 market crash, because it signalled the Fed had to pivot.

**The 2022-2025 cycle**

In this cycle, inflation has been hovering around 2-3%, but interest rates have been 4-5%. You can get that sweet-ass 4-5% just by putting money in a high-yield savings account. That means people can earn 1-3% above inflation by doing nothing. There's very little reason for anyone to put money into DeFi.

With low DeFi TVL and no hype, Ethereum-like chains that depend on DeFi basically all died. This is why your altcoin died.

**Altcoins that did work in 2022-2025**

Some examples:

SOL: \~$9 → $200+

RAY: \~$0.15 → \~$7.50

PENDLE: \~$0.05 → \~$7

INJECTIVE: \~$1.30 → $40+

ROLLBIT: \~$0.002 → $0.20+

**What do all these have in common? Leverage.**

RAY lets you buy SOL memecoins that can 10x-100x fast. You need SOL for gas. PENDLE lets you make big gains when DeFi interest rates move from 2% to 4%. HELIX on INJECTIVE gives you up to 50x leverage on crypto futures. ROLLBIT is a crypto casino that also offers leveraged crypto futures.

People still want chances to double their money or more in a year. They do not care about 5-8% returns. Protocols that turn greed into revenue do fantastic, but everything else fails.

**If you want to do well next cycle;**

Either stick to Bitcoin, **OR** focus on protocols that offer some form of leverage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p4l1go/a_post_mortem_this_is_why_your_altcoin_died_this/,RatherCynical,0,24,0.29,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1763899276.0,2025-11-23T12:01:16

Furthermore, Buterin believes that it is not possible to expose investors’ positions, cash flows, and counter parties to the entire world and still be competitive, and meet regulatory constraints.

He also argued that ZK-proofs should be implemented on the client-side to enable account abstraction... integrating ZK-proofs with mainstream wallets will enable individual users to control private funds, without revealing wallet addresses. 

Buterin stated, “This allows total convergence: your ETH account becomes a universal authorization mechanism, and can even secure offchain applications.”

1oyfe01,Outlook for next week on BTC & ETH,"Hi Everybody, I'm Ashley. I'm a chart nerd, been doing it a while so I'm pretty good at it by now. Here is my forecast for good buying opportunities in the crypto space at key levels if we get there this week.

BTC - Looks exhausted, only a moron would sell this this after a large fall from 124000, bears take profits too. Oversold on RSI and Stochastics. Bullish divergence on the daily chart. There is a strong double strength support at 91000 and change. Extremely bearish sentiment based on nothing, there is no monster under the bed. Verdict - Look for buys around 91000.

ETH - Chart is suggesting we have one final leg down before we bounce back. Oversold on RSI and stochastics. Similar to BTC there is a strong double strength support on the weekly chart around 2700. Verdict - Buy for a strong bounce around 2700.

The fear and greed index is currently showing a reading of 10 according to TradingView. Insane bounce territory, particularly when the fall has been quick. The quicker the fall, usually the stronger the bounce.

Convergence across multiple metrics we have one final leg down before the big bounce. We all waited for prices to fall like this, now they're here, don't fumble the opportunity. 

It's time to load the boat.

1oy415j,ZEC and the weird price action,"Throw out privacy, it doesn’t explain the price action and we know it. If it was about privacy, SOL / ETH can build that on top of their L1 and maintain industry scale. ZCash does not have nearly the same scale or speed as these other chains do and that’s real.

What ZCash has going for it is the US capitalizing on first mover advantage. We’re not accumulating Bitcoin fast enough as other countries, so what do we do? We target a chain that has a good history of fair distribution, not widely used, but based off Bitcoin from a blockchain structure + added in privacy. We load up and run this to be the next Bitcoin. That’s what I think is happening, my tin foil hat theory.

What do you think? Do you think privacy is truly what’s driving price action or is it something else?

1ox198w,Bitcoin or Gold? This actually made me think,"Been trying to wrap my head around the whole Bitcoin vs Gold debate, and I finally found something that actually makes sense.

One quote that really stood out to me:

""The idea of returning to gold-backed money sounds comforting, like getting back together with a reliable ex. But you’d be forgetting the reasons you split up. Yes, fiat is a toxic relationship, but that doesn’t mean gold is the answer. What we need isn’t a reunion. We need an upgrade.""

[Bitcoin vs Gold – Part 2](https://cryptoconfidence.substack.com/p/gold-vs-bitcoin-part-2)

It frames Bitcoin as more than just a digital asset,  there’s context, history, and comparisons to gold that actually make you think.

Curious to hear your thoughts:

Do you see Bitcoin as a better store of value than gold?

Or is gold still the “reliable ex” we can’t quit? 

Did anything in these articles shift how you think about crypto at all?

1oqwfgz,Make hardware wallets make sense to me,"Alright, I've been thinking about it, and no matter how much I do, I don't get the point of hardware wallets.

For me, there are a few use cases (I'm disregarding illicit ones) for cryptocurrencies in general:

1. Investing into them long-term. Holding some part of your wealth in Bitcoin or whatever you think is best for that. You don't plan on selling any of it for 10 years+. You may or may not have the extra conviction to have full control over your assets.
2. Investing into them, but on a shorter timeframe. You want to hold some of your wealth there, but eventually, you might want to withdraw some, but not all the time.
3. Holding some of it and borrowing against it to pay daily bills.
4. Using it for paying for stuff on the internet. It's kind of an edge case right now, but it does happen.
5. Transferring money between countries with no common or dysfunctional banking systems.
6. Trading, either on centralized exchanges or on decentralized exchanges.

Point 3 isn't really possible with self-custody anyway, your assets are collateral, that means it will be in some custodial wallet. This is out for a hardware wallet.

Point 4 you want convenience. Connecting a hardware wallet every time you make a transaction is annoying, and you'll probably not hold a significant portion of your wealth in such a wallet. For a small wallet for active transactions, a hot wallet (custodial or self-custodial) seems most reasonable, no point in a hardware wallet.

Point 5 is similar to the former point. You're holding the money for a short time, a hardware wallet would be more of an inconvenience and you don't gain much from it. But I can see how it can feel cool for some, I don't see the point in it.

Point 6, a hardware wallet makes little sense. Tradinc on a centralized exchange is custodial anyway, and decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid, you can use with a hardware wallet, but this isn't the place for long-term investments, so the size argument probably is key here again. I don't see the big benefit there.

Point 1, a hardware wallet makes no sense to me. You don't need a hardware wallet to put money into it. You're not withdrawing for years anyway, and you need to backup your key whatever you do (which is not trivial). If self-custody is important to you and you don't trust banks, a paper wallet - multiple backups, in multiple places, safely stored, ideally not recognizable as keys to a wallet - makes much more sense than a hardware wallet. If you have a hardware wallet lying around in your house it telegraphs to anyone finding it that you have it, and they might coerce access from you. Since you're not withdrawing anyway, you don't need the convenience they give of actually accessing the wallet. And if in the future, in many years, you REALLY want to withdraw, then you can still import it into a hardware wallet.

Point 2, to me, is the only one where a hardware wallet could conceivably make sense. But for that case, the non-long-term part of your holdings, which you hold for months or a couple years, just choosing the convenience of an ETF seems so much better in any way. You don't have the responsibility to secure them (that's your broker's responsibility), you don't have any risk of losing it, and you can sell anytime, if you need the money. If you don't trust banks, you can split your holdings in the long-term part (see Point 1), and just hold parts of it in an ETF, which also diversifies the ways you might lose access to your assets (if the bank blocks you from it, you still have the fallback of the self-custodial part, and if you happen to lose all your backups, you can always recover your broker...).

If self-custody is not important to you, ETFs are the way to go for both points 1 and 2, anyway.

Long story short, my question: do you have any tangible use cases where a hardware wallet would be necessary or beneficial (in contrast to a paper wallet, which does make sense in some cases)?
