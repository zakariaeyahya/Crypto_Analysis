1p9pej7,Contratian View: Bitcoin Risks Fall to $75k By Dec 10 - A2Z Cryptocurrencies,"Rekt Capital says Bitcoin must decisively break above $93.5k this week.

A failure could mean the breakdown of the current long-term uptrend since November 2024.

A 0% rate cut could bring a crash to $75k, and negative guidance opens the risk to $56k.

Fresh estimates suggest a fall could potentially bring BTC to $56k range.

Possible end of institutional liquidity forces investors to sell in advance.

Fundamentally, Bitcoin is at its worst stage because the institutional buyers that have been pouring liquidity into the current markets are at risk of being removed from stock market indices.

Strategy(MSTR) by Michael Saylor, which operates the largest Bitcoin Treasury, is at risk of getting removed from the S&P500, which means that all index funds that have MSTR shares might have to sell them in the open market. The same is the case with all Bitcoin Treasuries. If that happens, we could see these treasuries dumping BTC on the market.",https://a2zcryptocurrencies.com/bitcoin-is-below-its-critical-bull-market-level-risks-fall-to-75k-by-dec-10/,emperordas,0,6,0.32,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764424153.0,2025-11-29T13:49:13

1p9kedn,Bitcoin to 500k+,"To anyone with anyone still with any doubt in this hear me out. 

I am a millennial, my parents bought there first house for around about 60,000 usd in the 90s in the UK. That same house, is now worth over a million, it’s not even  fancy town, my dad was a steel worker in a factory. My mum worked part time and they had 2 kids. They purchased a 4 bedroom detached hoise with a garden on a single income.

The purchasing power of my parents has fallen off a cliff, they are wealthy on paper because they have housing, but the cost of everything from energy, food, water is astronomical, they just don’t have housing to worry about unlike the rest of us.
We all know the financial system is ****** and stacked against us, this doesn’t just affect millennials, this affects all future generations after boomers and Gen X.

Once Gen X and the boomer generations have offloaded their only assets for the equity (housing) they need to survive we will be entering a new age of neo feudalism where this “wealth” is extracted and transferred to the capitalist owning class and everything is rented back to us.

Bitcoin is the first time our generation has been given an asset that isn’t already hyper inflated. Unfortunately with time, with how the cryptocurrency market is being integrated with the traditional finance. the result will be the same. The value of this is going to skyrocket. In 10 years I believe bitcoin will probably be over 500kusd.

In the Uk they just announced they are going to start taxing pension contributions where as before it was done when you withdraw from your pension. The state is looking for the money and this will get worse with time, they aren’t going to tax their masters or the tax dodging corporations so retirement is going to get harder from here on out.

Stack as many sats as you can, use it  as pension. Good luck. 🤞

1p9ebti,How Bitcoin turned its “strongest month” into its worst in 7 years...,"Bitcoin is having one of its worst Novembers since the 2018 bear market and here’s why it’s happening.

So far this month, Bitcoin is down roughly 17–20%, trading around the $90–92k range. That’s pretty close to the losses from November 2019, when BTC dropped about 17–18%. The worst November on record was back in 2018, with a brutal ~36% crash in the middle of that bear market.

Historically, November has actually been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, with average returns around 40% in past cycles, so this kind of red November is a big break from the usual pattern. One major structural change this time around is that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs finally launched in January 2024, which pulled a lot of institutional money directly into BTC and may have shifted the timing of the typical post-halving “euphoria” phase.

Since those ETFs went live, institutions and large funds have played a much bigger role in price action, and a lot of analysts think that’s changed the rhythm of this cycle. Instead of the classic script where October and November often rip higher, this year October already closed slightly red and November is now deeply negative despite that historically bullish seasonality.

Another huge factor has been leverage getting nuked. A ton of traders were running oversized long positions with borrowed money, and when the October and November sell-offs hit, billions of dollars in longs were force-liquidated. That cascade of liquidations amplified the downside and helped drive BTC from an all-time high around $126k in October down into the low $80ks at the worst point of this drawdown.

Some analysts actually see this “flush” as a necessary cleansing process. It shakes out over-leveraged players and weak hands, kills off some of the froth, and can set up a healthier base for the next leg up once the market digests all the forced selling.

One interesting pattern from the last decade: every time Bitcoin has had a red November, December has also finished red. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but if that pattern holds and you combine it with the usual post-halving correction, it wouldn’t be shocking if real recovery takes time and stretches well into 2026 rather than bouncing straight back in the next few weeks",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p9ebti/how_bitcoin_turned_its_strongest_month_into_its/,hodorrny,39,26,0.71,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764386502.0,2025-11-29T03:21:42
1p9e3e6,Some whale just dropped $84 million on a Bitcoin long position and everyone’s talking about it.,"A trader that on chain analyst The Data Nerd spotted just opened a massive BTC long on Hyperliquid.... about $84.19 million with 3x leverage. That’s not pocket change, that’s serious conviction that Bitcoin is heading up.

What makes this interesting is the timing. Bitcoin is sitting around the low $90k range right now and has been pretty volatile lately. This trader is basically betting big that we’re going to see higher prices soon. The position uses leverage too, which means the gains could be huge but so could the losses if things go south.

The market has definitely been heating up. Daily BTC trading volume is in the high tens of billions of dollars right now, so there’s clearly a lot of activity and interest. Between whales, derivatives and bigger players still taking directional bets, there’s plenty of fuel for more volatility in both directions.

These kinds of whale moves usually create ripple effects. Other traders see this and it ends up influencing their decisions – sometimes it brings in more buyers, sometimes it just adds even more chaos to the price action.

Personally I think it’s wild to see someone throw that much money on a leveraged bet. One wrong move and that’s a massive liquidation. But clearly some people are still comfortable taking huge swings at these levels.

Anyone else watching this play out What do you think happens next with Bitcoin",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p9e3e6/some_whale_just_dropped_84_million_on_a_bitcoin/,Gullible-Tale9114,182,104,0.66,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764385799.0,2025-11-29T03:09:59
1p9ccdw,Why hasn't there been a leak from Strategy?,"I mean it's pretty obvious to me what happened. Nasdaq threatened to delist Strategy because Bitcoin was 77% of their company. They can not be more than 55% to be listed on the Nasdaq. Thus they are/were a treasury company.

Bitcoin tanked hard and fast after that news from 103k to 81k.

MSTR on the Sep 30, 2025 10Q had 640,031 bitcoins, or a ""carrying value"" of $73 billion.

They have $15.5 billion in debt including 8.1 billion in debt in convertible notes. All of their income from the past 9 months was attributed to basically deferred taxes.

So basically if Strategy were to want to maintain Nasdaq compliance, bear minimum, they would have to dump 422k Bitcoins worth $42.2 billion.

To me, that explains EVERYTHING, perfectly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p9ccdw/why_hasnt_there_been_a_leak_from_strategy/,f00dl3,0,11,0.34,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764380612.0,2025-11-29T01:43:32

1p91bso,GoMining Bitcoin Mining App (Legit),"So I have been investing in this app GoMining / Gominer and you pay to have a stake in bitcoin miners all around the country. I’ve invested close to 1500$ and I’ve only seen about a 300$ return so far in maybe 2 months but for anyone curious let me know. I make about 2.20 btc a day right now and have obviously made some mistakes and could have been making more etc, but as someone who is into crypto (as I’m sure everyone in this group is) and wants a legitimate way to mine Bitcoin, I’d be more than happy to help show you the way! There having a Black Friday deal as well so -15% any miner purchase is a great time to get in. I’d say starting off with a 100$ - 200$ investment is a great way to get your feet wet and start learning while saving 15% and (gaining VIP levels) with chances at winning free miners, discounts or there crypto they use specifically for purchases. If your interested comment or shoot me a message. I’m by no means a scammer, I work at Ford and I’m a 31 year old father from Michigan, and I’m not looking for anyone to lose money in these economic times 😁
