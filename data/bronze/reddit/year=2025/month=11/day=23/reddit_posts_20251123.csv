1p5llbc,Users push trading volume in US stock-linked futures past $5 billion on Bitget,"Even as Bitcoin’s price slump rattles the wider crypto market, Bitget has crossed over $5 billion in cumulative trading volume on its US stock-linked perpetual futures.

The exchange says its integration allows users to fund their accounts in USDT and trade crypto assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL alongside equities including AAPL, TSLA, NVDA, and MSTR, without opening a separate brokerage account. Cash-in and cash-out options include P2P and direct rails where available.

Bitget’s current offering includes stock-linked perpetual futures tied to major companies such as Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, with additional index contracts providing one-tap exposure to broader market and tech baskets.

Other offering for users include Trading Club Championship Phase 18 where users can trade UXLINK and AIA spot and futures daily to earn BGB...

The exchange emphasises that these instruments are derivatives mirroring the price movements of selected US equities, not actual shares, and therefore do not convey dividends or voting rights.

will other CEXs emulate this diversification with stocks?",https://www.citizen.digital/article/bitget-users-push-trading-volume-in-us-stock-linked-futures-past-5-billion-n373407,Green_Candler,6,3,0.88,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764001710.0,2025-11-24T16:28:30

1p5kgda,Companies are staking their SOL and I'm just holding,"Bought SOL at $180 and been holding since. Price goes up, price goes down, nothing really changes. Just sits there.

Saw on Twitter today some EdTech company Classover is running validators with their treasury SOL. They're using the staking rewards to subsidize their platform or something like that.

Made me realize I'm just holding while companies are actually putting it to work. I could stake mine but honestly too lazy to figure out which validator to use and whether it's worth the hassle for the amount I have.

The ironic part is they're probably making more off staking than I am off price movement. And if more companies start doing this instead of just holding like MicroStrategy does with Bitcoin, maybe that's actually better for the network.

Or maybe it doesn't matter at all and I'm just trying to feel better about my bags not moving. Can't tell anymore.

Their stock didn't pump on the news so clearly market doesn't care. But made me think whether I should actually do something with my SOL instead of just waiting for number to go up.

Probably won't though. Too much effort.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p5kgda/companies_are_staking_their_sol_and_im_just/,jselby81989,1,3,0.57,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1763999220.0,2025-11-24T15:47:00
