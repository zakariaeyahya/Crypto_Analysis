1p6qr3h,"10 years of crypto journey, but I am quitting.","Ten years in crypto have been quite a journey. I remember how hard it was to find quality content about crypto back then, when most of the material was still about earning free bitcoin faucets and anarcho-capitalists talking about bitcoin’s future.

There were only a few exchanges and most didn’t even require KYC. Altcoins were this hazy thing, you had to download the wallet to your PC and often the whole blockchain just to store your little coins. It was fun and innovative.

Ethereum started to take off in 2017 and smart contracts began pulling crypto out of the prehistoric era. An ICO here, another one there, tokens were being listed on exchanges with ridiculous pumps, suddenly everyone wanted a piece of the pie and ICOs started crawling out of the gutter.

Masternodes, PoS coins, smart contracts, hard forks with miners and idealists still trying to be the lords of bitcoin. Bitcoin was still viewed with huge distrust by small investors, but that didn’t stop it from making the most memorable rally, going from 600 dollars in September 2016 to almost 20k in December 2017. It felt like the revolution of the century.

Then came the long winter in 2018. Bitcoin dropped more than 80 percent, but it was a pretty normal bear-market correction, maybe boosted by the frenzy of greedy and failed ICOs.

It took until the covid crash for the market to heat up again. The amount of money injected into the economy was insane. For a brief moment it felt like there were fewer projects than there was demand. It started with DeFi, the rise of DEXes, governance tokens and generous airdrops. For me that was the best moment in crypto, between 2020 and 2021. But as 2021 went on, the exuberance went way overboard. Crypto went mainstream with celebrities, meme coins, blockchain games, NFTs costing almost as much as a yacht, and ponzi schemes like Luna and FTX popping up and somehow reaching absurd valuations.

In 2022 reality hit hard and crypto collapsed like never before. Losses and bankruptcies were everywhere. BTC fell below its 2017 peak again and a lot of inexperienced investors who got caught in the hype the year before were wiped out. Even stablecoins were under extreme distrust. I remember coworkers asking for help with Metamask and buying NFTs, that was the ultimate bubble signal. These people will never come back to crypto, and who could blame them? Even experienced investors lost fortunes.

Then 2024 arrived and thanks to the first bitcoin spot ETF prices went up quickly, even before the halving cycle. It was the bitcoin dominance cycle. Only a few selected altcoins went up and those crazy altseasons were left behind. Even with a pro-crypto president the market didn’t heat up, the mood of distrust and resentment was still there. Any sign of buying or innovation that used to look like a game changer and a promising opportunity started to be seen as a scam. Controversial listings on big exchanges, insiders dumping, tokens that seemed created only to benefit a tiny group of sharks with no real value. There are way more tokens than the current cautious and selective demand can handle, barely any liquidity. I think even serious projects got hit by this paranoia and never took off.

My view is that crypto lost a big part of the ideology that made it interesting. For you to download an entire blockchain and store your little coins, someone had to really believe in that thing. There was an idea behind it, something that didn’t involve venture-capital money, shady insider allocations, or quick profits from futures trading. Crypto turned into pure speculation. Everything is easy now. A project appears and it’s already listed for derivatives trading, and people don’t care about anything else. They just see it drop 50 percent in a week and nobody wants it anymore. The promise of more liquidity came at a high price, with clueless investors and vultures who robbed and keep robbing the space.

Crypto turned into just trading, empty and random, nothing behind it, fast gains and goodbye. At least with stocks you can see some backing, results, profits, a business to evaluate. With crypto we are longing and shorting hot air without any real contact with the technology. Crypto is technology. It shouldn’t be just a TradingView chart. In the end crypto became and solidified itself as inferior to the stock market.

AI stocks are tied to products you actually use daily. Health-care stocks influence what you pay at the pharmacy. Defense stocks shape where a big chunk of taxpayer money goes.

Crypto is just money speculating on itself. There’s no substantial innovation anymore, nobody gets excited about using a smart contract or downloading a new wallet and appreciating a protocol’s tech. I still have my Monero wallet here in the old-school way, but one of the few coins that actually fulfills a real use case ends up banned from exchanges, and that says a lot.

**Unfortunately I don’t see much of a future anymore. For all the reasons I mentioned, both financially and in terms of real innovation, the stock market has become way more interesting to follow and, to some degree, safer to invest in. That’s why I’m cashing out of crypto. I think it already served its purpose and its best days are behind it for good.** ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p6qr3h/10_years_of_crypto_journey_but_i_am_quitting/,pedronegreiros94,620,416,0.79,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764110035.0,2025-11-25T22:33:55

1p6kdaz,Over 8% of all Bitcoin just changed hands in a week - markets on a knife's edge waiting for Fed decision,"So something historically significant just happened. More than 8% of Bitcoins entire supply changed hands over the past seven days. Joe Burnett from Semler Scientific called this one of the most significant onchain events in Bitcoin history.

The last times we saw supply movements this large were in March 2020 when BTC was around 5000 dollars and December 2018 when it hit 3500. Both of those marked local bottoms before accumulation phases that eventually led to new all time highs. So historically this type of activity has been bullish longterm.

Theres a catch tho. Up to half of this movement might just be from Coinbase doing a wallet migration they announced on Saturday. So the actual selling and buying pressure might be less dramatic than the raw numbers suggest.

Right now the markets completely focused on what the Fed does on December 10th. Odds of a 25 basis point rate cut jumped from 50% to 82% in just a week according to CME Groups FedWatch tool. Thats whats fueling Bitcoins recovery from 81k back to 87k.

Nic Puckrin from Coin Bureau put it pretty well saying were on a knifes edge and the Fed holds the key to whether we get a Santa rally or a Santa dump. As we get closer to December 10th expect volatility to pick up even more.

The mixed messages about rate cuts are keeping everyone on edge. Markets jitters are gonna continue until we actually get clarity from the Feds press conference. Basically everyones just waiting to see what Jerome Powell says before making any big moves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p6kdaz/over_8_of_all_bitcoin_just_changed_hands_in_a/,Gullible-Tale9114,1,3,0.52,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764095564.0,2025-11-25T18:32:44
1p6k6rk,"""March 2013 Chain Fork Post-Mortem"" by Gavin Andresen - The 1st known Bitcoin Double-Spend where a merchant lost $10,000 after a 24-block Bitcoin reorg and hard fork on the network","I think a lot of people have forgotten that there has been at least 1 true double-spend as a result of a hard fork on Bitcoin.

This was confirmed by many core devs including Gavin Andresen among others: [March 2013 Chain Fork Post-Mortem](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki)

**Background**

In 2013, there was a [catastrophic bug in the 0.8 Bitcoin release](https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2015/07/28/analyzing-the-2013-bitcoin-fork-centralized-decision-making-saved-the-day/) that caused a **hard fork** between Bitcoin Core 0.7 and 0.8. Later on, 0.8.1 was released to patch the bug, but before that happened, Bitcoin mining pools **51% attacked** the network to revert the canonical chain back to 0.7, leading to a massive **24-block, 5-hour reorg**. At the time, this was the 2nd largest reorg of Bitcoin (the largest being the 53-block reorg in 2010 for the 184B minting bug).

About 60% of mining power had already switched to 0.8, so it was the canonical chain.

**51% attack and 24-block reorg**

Afterwards, a few Bitcoin mining pools decided to support the 0.7 fork, and Bitcoin mining pools BTCGuild and Slush (among others) 51% attacked the network. Many members of the community and merchants were not given sufficient time to respond.

**Double-spend attack**

Unfortunately, by the time of the reorg, [OKPAY accepted a $10K deposit from a user at block 225446](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=152348.0) of the 0.8 chain. This allowed a UTXO from the orphaned 0.8 chain to be rebroadcast to the mempool and reused, leading to the first known cryptocurrency double-spend.

FTR, OKPAY later confirmed that they ""[resolved this situation](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=152348.msg1619711#msg1619711)"" with the attacker who executed the double-spend, and I'm guessing that means they returned the money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p6k6rk/march_2013_chain_fork_postmortem_by_gavin/,HSuke,15,3,0.9,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764095161.0,2025-11-25T18:26:01

1p6h77w,Monad thoughts..,"Thoughts on Monad? I’m stuck between the massive technical upside and the highly centralized token distribution.

The Potential (Why It Could Be the Real Deal):

 * 10,000 TPS via Parallel Execution: Monad is the first EVM-compatible chain to implement optimistic parallel execution. This allows it to process transactions simultaneously, a fundamental breakthrough over the sequential execution model of Ethereum.
 * Full EVM Compatibility: Existing Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) can be ported directly without code changes, providing an instant gateway to existing DeFi and developer communities.
 * Significant Backing: Raised over $400 million from top-tier VCs (like Paradigm), indicating strong belief in its long-term infrastructure vision.

The Concern (The Red Flag):

 * Small Public Allocation: Only 7.5% of the total supply is designated for the public sale. This is a very low percentage, leading to concerns about centralization and a market heavily reliant on a small circulating supply.
 * Vesting Schedules: While the large allocations to the team and VCs are locked up until mid-2026 and later, the high projected Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) suggests that all future success is already priced in.

TL;DR: Is this the necessary technical upgrade for EVM, or is it a high-risk, VC-backed project using good tech to justify a massive launch valuation?

What’s your gut feeling? Real deal or overhyped?

1p660rr,Ethereum's Fusaka Upgrade Hits Dec 3 - Massive UX Buff Incoming,"Just crossed with this Leon [Tweet ](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1985669360719917407)talking about Ethereum's next big upgrade that lands on December 3, 2026 and its perks

https://preview.redd.it/c14v2m14sc3g1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ba7602efba0af0af4540e42dd60493c345d89de

As you probably know by know, this coming December 3 is an important date for Ethereum holders and team, Fusaka upgrade is coming to mainnet on that day.

This upgrade is a game changer and will improve the ecosystem a lot making it very usable and better for the long term. Ethereum basically hit the gym, cutting weight and becoming faster and smoother, all of this without sacrificing security. This is a quality of life buff for users, devs and business.

As you can see in the tweet and in the image above these are the things that Fusaka brings to the table:

* **30–60% cheaper transfers** \- sending ETH or tokens is more affordable.
* **3–5x faster-feeling transactions** \- not instant but close to a no wait just send vibe.
* **NFT minting costs drop 60–70%** \-huge for creators, platforms and anyone making drops.
* **More stability for businesses** \- Less spikes, smother execution and almost no downtime.
* **Developers save 25–35% on gas** \- This will help devs to build more and have less things to cry about xD

The final result? A better user experience for everyone, from degen traders to Web3 startups or just for people who only touch Ethereum when they mint an NFT.

This is also cool because Fusaka boosts the whole modular ecosystem without trying to replace rollups or rewrite Ethereum's roadmap.

December 3, dont forget that date, it will probably dont affect price in the short term but it will in the long term.

Are you hyped for Fusaka?
