1owm8xk,Why ZEC but not RAIL?,"ZEC has been increasing in value significantly lately, and so has XMR. These are seemingly the two main privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies out there. But what about privacy on ETH?

I think we are all familiar with Ethereum? A very large ecosystem with a lot of users and real utility, but lacking some basic privacy as it is account-based. Other coins like BTC or LTC are actually a bit more privacy-oriented as they use UTXO instead.

This got me thinking, why is no one paying attention to RAIL from the Railgun/Railway project?

We all k ows this other infamous ETH privacy project named Tornado Cash, which has been used by many bad actors, but Railway seems to have a solution by adding a 1-hour window before ERC20 tokens can be shielded to make sure no bad actors taint the privacy pool. The idea of Railway is actually very similar to shielding on Zcash/ZEC, except RAIL is a gov. token and not a store of value (like ZEC tries to be)

Imagine a world where you can actually send somewhat private transactions using USDT/USDC -- whatever your fav. Stable coin is -- without exposing ur full wallet footprint to the friends and family you transact with. 

TL;DR Unlike Tornado Cash, the amount (any ERC20) to shield isn't fixed. You can send from shield to shield, like in Zcash, but no new value/money is created as it can be applied to any existing ERC20 tokens",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1owm8xk/why_zec_but_not_rail/,Ferib,0,13,0.37,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1763092319.0,2025-11-14T03:51:59

1oweu4k,Eric Trump says the future of finance is crypto,"Bitcoin ([BTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/)) and other cryptocurrencies [will be the future of money and investments](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eric-trump-says-the-future-of-finance-is-crypto-211158417.html), according to Eric Trump.

""It's the greatest hedge against inflation ... against corruption ... against poorly managed monetary systems around the world. That's why you see this global influx into bitcoin. It's probably become the greatest asset of our time,"" Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said at [Yahoo Finance's Invest event](https://finance.yahoo.com/invest2025/).

Trump has made no secret of his big bet on cryptocurrency. Alongside his brother Donald Jr., he co-founded American Bitcoin ([ABTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ABTC/)), a crypto mining firm that went public in September and now sports a market value of roughly $4 billion.

The president's second son has touted the company's merger with Gryphon Digital Mining as a way to scale operations, though critics warn the deal could leave the company — and its investors — vulnerable to crypto's wild price swings.

The firm is the 25th-largest bitcoin accumulator in the country right now (among public companies), just eight months after its launch, per Trump.

He credited the firm's competitive edge to its cheap energy costs, adding that the company is mining bitcoin in West Texas ""for roughly 50 cents on the dollar to the spot price every single day.""

1owehsr,Does anyone else notice the political shift in the crypto conference scene?,"Lately, I’ve been noticing that a lot of the big voices at crypto conferences seem to come from the right-wing side of the political spectrum, and many of them focus heavily on “get rich quick” messaging—pushing meme coins, hype tokens, and other centralized projects that feel pretty far removed from the original purpose of Bitcoin and the broader idea of decentralization.

For example, people like Eric Trump have a noticeable following at these events, and the conversation often seems to revolve around speculation rather than the foundational principles of decentralizing finance, increasing economic fairness, or building open systems.

I’m curious if others are seeing the same trend.  
Is the conference space right now mostly dominated by right-leaning promoters and hype-driven projects? Or am I just noticing a loud subset of the industry?

1owbxmd,Bitcoin High Timeframe Thoughts,"^(Posting here for obligatory criticism, something something TA is astrology for guys, and to elicit a few bear market capitulation comments.)

**Since 2023 Bitcoin \*always\* retraced to between the 50% and 62% ""golden pocket."" Extremely normal and healthy.**

**If that repeats, BTC will find a bottom in the mid to lower $90s, maybe wick a little lower intraweek, and taking another month or so to round out a proper bottom (unless we get lucky but I don't see a sudden reversal happening here).**

**But if the trend doesn't continue, we obviously.. go lower \[shocking analysis, I know\].** I discuss those levels in another X post (rarely post here anymore) but a lot of support exists lower, worst case is $75k(ish) imo.

I've been of the opinion for a while that the Supreme Court's tariff decision directly impacts the Fed's ability to make a more dovish pivot. Ideally those are more settled before we recover properly.

Its rumored the Court's decision on tariffs could take as long as January. That plays well in terms of time: its been taking \~2 months for crypto bottoms to round out and shake off the peak fear.

In the meantime the other economic data and AI narrative is going to jockey crypto around.. up, down, left, right... but hopefully above this trendline at monthly close.

1ow8ljb,2026 401k limits just increased could this affect crypto market liquidity,"the irs just bumped 401k limits to 24,500 for 2026 up from 23,500 in 2025. ira limit moves to 7,500. for catch ups, age 50 plus can add 8,000 and the special age 60 to 63 catch up stays 11,250. looks small, but across millions of savers it is real money shifting into tax advantaged accounts.

why it matters for crypto… more room in 401ks could mean a little less cash chasing risk assets outside retirement. also, a heads up for higher earners: starting in 2026, catch ups are roth only if your prior year social security wages with that employer were 150k or more, so the tax break on the catch up isn’t the same as pre tax.

counterpoint… a small but growing set of plans now allow crypto exposure directly or via brokerage windows and bitcoin etfs, so higher limits could funnel some money into btc or eth inside retirement menus. that said, usage is still limited.

and zoom out… only about 14 percent of participants max out their 401k anyway, so the macro impact may be modest versus headlines.

Try explaining to a normie why their NFT on Ethereum can't easily move to Polygon, or why bridging tokens requires trusting some random multisig. It's insane.

The good news is some teams are actually solving this. Been experimenting with Caldera's approach where chains can natively communicate through their Metalayer protocol. It's not perfect but it's way better than traditional bridges.

What we really need is for more projects to prioritize interop from day one instead of treating it as an afterthought. Every new L1 or L2 that launches in isolation just makes the problem worse.

BTC fees have been a major problem several times in the coin's history. These days it seems that BTC utilization is down, so fees remain fairly low. Miners need those fees to remain profitable as the block reward keeps halving. If price doesn't double by the next halving, some miners will be forced to go bankrupt. So keeping blocks full and transactions up is vital to keeping fees high. As of today, the average BTC fee is less than $1 per transaction, while miners' energy cost is surely more than that. Maybe this is why the Core devs are allowing larger amounts data in BTC transactions via Taproot and removing OP\_RETURN limits, as they'll fill up the blocks and increase fees artificially?

Average fees went to $128.45 in 2024:

1ovd9va,"The world’s largest funds networkchooses Polygon to launch tokenized fund share classes to 4,500 financial institutions","tl;dr

* Calastone, with £250B+ monthly, will launch tokenized fund share classes on Polygon
* Integration brings onchain fund distribution to 4.5k financial institutions in 58 markets
* Polygon’s sub-cent fees and near-instant finality make large-scale institutional settlement practical onchain
* Calastone is a major step toward bringing onchain capital markets built on scalable, transparent infrastructure

Calastone, the global funds network that processes more than £250 billion in transactions each month, is launching its tokenized fund distribution solution on Polygon, the go-to stack powering global money movement, supporting sending billions in value, instantly. 

The integration brings institutional-scale fund distribution onchain, enabling asset managers to operate fund share classes directly over blockchain rails while maintaining the administrative and compliance processes they already use. 

This marks one of the first large-scale integrations of blockchain into global fund infrastructure. Calastone’s adoption of Polygon provides a model for how tokenization can modernize asset distribution. With Polgyon’s rails, Calastone reduces intermediaries, expands cross-border access, and enhances transparency without disrupting compliance or custody standards.

Polygon delivers the scale, Ethereum compatibility, and cost efficiency that global institutions need to operate onchain, without sacrificing trust or performance.

By launching tokenized fund share classes on Polygon, Calastone unlocks new pathways for both institutional and retail investors. Asset managers can reach digital-first investor pools globally, while blockchain transparency and automation simplify settlement and reconciliation across jurisdictions.

The integration also signals a broader shift underway: the migration of traditional capital markets onto public, open infrastructure. As Polygon’s Rio and Heimdall upgrades bring speeds of up to 5,000 TPS and instant finality, the network continues to position itself as the go-to chain for institutional-grade payments and tokenized assets.

Calastone’s Tokenised Distribution is now live, with expanded functionality and network integrations planned throughout 2025, a milestone that takes a major step to bring the future of fund management onchain.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ovd9va/the_worlds_largest_funds_networkchooses_polygon/,0xpolygonlabs,12,2,0.83,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1762972314.0,2025-11-12T18:31:54

1ouqnui,MegaETH Revokes Crypto Influencer $1M Token Allocation Over Hedging Tweet,"What’s crypto without a little bit of drama? 

MegaETH, an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain, has revoked a nearly $1 million token allocation from prominent crypto influencer icobeast. The decision stemmed from a public tweet where he expressed interest in hedging his position, which violated the project's strict ICO terms.

So this will be confusing as the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is similar to the influencer’s name (icobeast). I will do my best to refer to the influencer with his full name. 

For background on the ICO: MegaETH's public token sale ran from October 28 to October 31, 2025, offering 500 million MEGA tokens, which was 5% of the total 10 billion supply, at a valuation that attracted over $1.4 billion in commitments for just $50 million worth of tokens, resulting in a staggering 28x oversubscription. Icobeast, a well-known figure in the space for his airdrop farming guides, reviews of projects, and history of securing large allocations in high-profile launches, was awarded a significant portion valued at approximately $1 million based on pre-market pricing.

The terms of the ICO were clear and uncompromising: Participants agreed to a one-year lock-up period on their tokens, with explicit prohibitions against any form of hedging, shorting, or over-the-counter (OTC) trading. Additionally, the agreement barred public statements on social media or elsewhere discussing intentions to sell, hedge, or otherwise mitigate risk, as these could undermine the project's goal of fostering long-term commitment from holders rather than short-term speculators.

The trigger was icobeast’s tweet on November 9, 2025: “At current pre-market prices my MegaETH ICO allocation is worth nearly $1 million dollars. I need to figure out how to hedge this.” The post went viral within crypto circles, amassing thousands of likes and replies debating the ethics of such transparency. Less than 24 hours later, icobeast followed up with: “My allocation has been revoked and is now worth $0,” confirming that MegaETH had enforced the clause by issuing a full refund and reallocating the tokens to other eligible participants.

This isn't the first sign of MegaETH's rigorous approach. MegaETH has emphasized building a ""real-time"" blockchain ecosystem free from the dump-and-run dynamics that plague many token launches. By revoking the allocation, they aimed to preserve scarcity and align incentives with genuine builders and users.

MegaETH tried to incorporate social scoring and reputation metrics like Ethos into its ICO allocation process to prioritize ""conviction"" over speculation. Allocations in the ""Conviction Round"" were determined algorithmically using onchain activity, wallet age, lock-up commitments, and reputation signals from platforms like Ethos and Kaito, alongside NFT holdings in the MegaETH ecosystem such as Fluffle and Bad Bunnz.

Ethos, a decentralized reputation protocol, assigns trust scores based on on-chain behavior, social contributions, and community feedback, categorizing users as ""trusted,"" ""neutral,"" or ""untrusted."" MegaETH weighted these scores alongside other data to filter for long-term holders, enforcing a one-year lock-up, no-hedging policy, and bans on public discussions of selling or risk mitigation.

icobeast entered with a high Ethos score reflecting positive on-chain engagement and social influence. This earned him an initial allocation valued at nearly $1 million at pre-market prices, positioning him as a top recipient under the system's metrics.

In stark contrast, influencer KookCapitalLLC, who’s known for rugging her followers, received a 94% allocation on her maximum $186,282 bid. This netted her $174,490 to purchase 1,746,644 MEGA tokens. Her Ethos score sits at 357, firmly in the ""untrusted"" tier, stemming from documented patterns of high-volume sales post-hype and public disputes, including rejecting KOL deals and score manipulation allegations.

This has become become super controversial as some praised MegaETH for upholding rules in an oversubscribed sale, others pointed out how a high-reputation participant with a clean Ethos profile loses out over a hypothetical statement, while a low-score figure with a history of alleged follower dumps secures whale status.

1ouhqwq,China just accused the US of conducting a state level hack to steal 13 billion in Bitcoin - this is wild,"Chinas National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center dropped a bombshell report accusing the US government of stealing 127k Bitcoin worth around 13 billion dollars. This is getting geopolitical fast.

The Bitcoin was originally stolen from Chinas LuBian mining pool back in December 2020. At the time it was worth about 3.5 billion but the hack did not get much mainstream attention. The coins then sat in the attacker’s wallets for years and only started moving in mid 2024 before ending up in addresses that analysts and China’s report now link to US authorities, and that the DOJ says it controls as of the seizure announced in October 2025.

Chinas argument is that normal criminals would cash out immediately. The fact these coins stayed dormant for about four years points to a state level operation not some random hacker looking for quick profit. They say the sophistication of the hack and the long dormancy proves it was government orchestrated.

The US Department of Justice seized the Bitcoin in October 2025 as part of a case against Chen Zhi who ran Cambodias Prince Group. They charged him with running a massive crypto fraud and forced labor scam network and said the seizure was a lawful criminal proceeds forfeiture. The DOJ has explicitly denied China’s “state level hack” accusation and says it had no involvement in the original theft.

Heres the thing tho. Chen Zhi apparently sent multiple messages on chain basically begging the hackers to return the Bitcoin and offering ransom. The hackers never responded which is weird if they were just criminals.

this batch of bitcoin now represents about 39 percent of all btc held by the us government based on on chain tracking of us controlled addresses… for what it’s worth, stuff like this is why i keep my own provenance tidy...i tag deposits and reconcile basis monthly in awaken.tax so if a wallet or cluster hits the news i can quickly see whether my coins ever touched that flow

1oubqni,SoFi rolls out crypto trading for retail customers,"Fintech bank SoFi ([SOFI](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SOFI/)) rolled out crypto trading to retail customers on Tuesday. The move sets the pace as the first of several national banks planning similar moves in the coming months.

SoFi previously gave customers the ability to buy, sell, and hold crypto through its app, but it agreed to shutter that service two years ago to obtain [approval](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2022/nr-occ-2022-4.html#:~:text=The%20conditions%20imposed%20on%20the%20bank%20include:,*%20Provide%20fair%20treatment%20to%20its%20customers) for its national banking license.

Starting Tuesday, select retail customers can again trade bitcoin ([BTC-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/)), ether ([ETH-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD/)), and other crypto assets. The plan is for all of SoFi's 12.6 million customers to gain access before the end of 2025.

“Today marks a pivotal moment when banking meets crypto in one app,"" SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a press release statement. ""It’s critical to give our members a secure and regulated way to step into the future of money,"" Noto added.

We all know the project got a really bad reputation when it launched.. the crazy market cap, the massive crash, the accusations of insider selling… it all made people label it as a scam or overhyped.

But when I dig a bit deeper, it actually seems like they’ve been quietly building real tech, full on-chain dApps, integrations with Bitcoin and Ethereum, and even ai related stuff now. It’s not the usual copy paste L1 project.

So I’m wondering, do you guys think ICP still has a real chance to make a comeback, or just a long-term liquidity trap for insiders and whales?

1ou0kzu,Ethereum’s Trust Layer Expands Beyond the Blockchain,"A new demo called **compute-escrow-privy** shows what the next stage of Ethereum’s expansion might look like. Built on **EigenCompute**, part of the EigenLayer ecosystem, it connects an ordinary Web2 escrow service to Ethereum’s validator-backed trust model.

It’s a small project, but it represents something big: the extension of Ethereum’s security into the off-chain world.

The demo uses a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) backend and Privy authentication, letting users sign in through standard Web2 methods while the core logic settles verifiably on Ethereum. Developers can fork the repository, deploy it through the EigenX CLI, and run a service that looks like a normal web app but operates under the same type of trust guarantees that secure the Ethereum network.

What this shows is more than a technical trick. It is a working demonstration of a new design pattern for how trust itself can be built, reused, and extended.

# 1. Practical verifiability for Web2

Instead of launching new blockchains or validator networks, developers can now anchor traditional applications to Ethereum’s existing security. That makes it practical to build verifiable services — like escrows, marketplaces, or data processors — without needing to reinvent the infrastructure of decentralization from scratch.

# 2. ETH as a universal bond

In this model, **ETH becomes the reusable foundation of digital trust**. The same capital that secures Ethereum’s consensus can now back independent services, functioning as a kind of economic bond for integrity. Each new application strengthens the network’s relevance, because its trust ultimately flows from Ethereum’s validators and the collateral they restake.

# 3. Familiar experience, verifiable core

From the user’s perspective, nothing changes — logins, dashboards, and APIs all feel like the Web2 internet. But under the hood, execution happens in verifiable environments, and outcomes can be proven on-chain. This merges convenience with verifiability instead of forcing a choice between them.

# 4. Broader implications

If this pattern spreads, it could reshape how the internet handles trust.  
Developers might stop creating new chains for every new idea and instead **reuse Ethereum’s validator base** to secure services directly. A whole market could form around *renting* Ethereum’s trust, where validators, restakers, and developers price and trade cryptographic assurance itself.

It also means that the boundary between Web2 and Web3 could fade. The same Ethereum security that once applied only to smart contracts could start underpinning AI models, databases, and cloud apps, without users even realizing it.

# 5. A shift in Ethereum’s role

Rollups and data blobs scaled Ethereum’s capacity to process transactions. EigenLayer and applications like compute-escrow-privy scale something different: **its trust model**. Ethereum’s reach is no longer confined to blockchains — it’s becoming a **base layer for verifiable computation**.

Whether this model becomes a standard is uncertain, but its direction is clear. Ethereum’s trust is beginning to extend beyond its own chain, out into the rest of the internet.

1otgvik,The Key Lesson I Learned After Nearly a Decade in Crypto,"I’ve seen dozens of crypto projects fail. I’ve seen a handful of crypto companies succeed.

To succeed, many hard things must align. To fail, only one key thing needs to go wrong.

After nearly a decade in this space, one pattern repeats itself: **the fastest path to failure is biasing toward idealism over pragmatism.**

I joined the industry for its ideals. It took years - and a few hard lessons - to unlearn them.

# Not About Memes or Casinos

This post is about projects trying to *create* value, not extract it. Those building new rails, not just running the same casino onchain.

Memes and casinos have their own kind of Product-Market-Fit. They entertain, they speculate, they move money. But they don’t *build*. They redistribute value rather than generate it.

**In short, this post is about teams growing the pie, not just grabbing the bigger slice.**

*Now that the disclaimer’s out of the way, let’s get into it.*

# Changing My Mind

I first dipped my toes into crypto in 2016, back when Vitalik would reply to my tweets or answer my technical questions on Gitter. For the past four years, I’ve been all in, building full-time.

That transition, from observer to participant, is when you start facing real tradeoffs. It’s when you stop quoting whitepapers and start debugging production systems. And it’s when your ideals begin to meet reality.

Below are examples I often bring up when discussing how **pragmatism (not purity) led to success.** These are companies I’ve been learning from.

# Pragmatic Successes

[**PolyMarket**](https://www.polymarket.com/) proved that stablecoins beat custom tokens for early traction in prediction markets. Back in 2016, [Augur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur_(software)) and [Gnosis](https://www.gnosis.io/blog/ten-years-of-gnosis-from-prediction-markets-to-a-user-owned-open-finance-revolution) kicked off the decentralized prediction markets ecosystem. Most people today haven’t heard of Augur, and know Gnosis mainly as a multisig or credit card company. But, everyone’s heard of PolyMarket, especially after their [$2B raise at a $9B valuation](https://insights4vc.substack.com/p/polymarket-raises-2b-at-9b-valuation). Their key move was focusing on product over tokenomics, avoiding getting [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by shiny ideals.

[**Solana**](https://www.solana.com/) showed that choosing speed over decentralization can capture real users. Solana’s vision was to run at the speed of the Nasdaq onchain. One of crypto’s deepest ideals is that anyone should be able to run a node or validator at home, in their basement, on a laptop, as part of the network’s collective strength. In practice, running a Solana validator requires professional-grade hardware and DevOps skills. It’s like needing to be an F1 driver just to commute to work. Solana made the hard tradeoff of centralization for performance, and it paid off. With a \~$91B market cap, pragmatism clearly won.

**Stablecoins** became crypto’s paradoxical success by embracing regulation and existing rails. Bitcoin dreamed of divorcing from the existing financial system; stablecoins married it. Now they’re on track for [$46T in annual volume](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2025/), with [Circle](https://www.circle.com/) IPOing and the [GENIUS Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582/text) adding clarity. They’re as anti-crypto-ideal as it gets, and yet, not showing any signs of slowing down.

[**Coinbase**](https://www.coinbase.com/) thrived by offering custody and compliance instead of maximalist purity. Crypto said: *Not your keys, not your coins.* Coinbase said: *Most people don’t want to manage keys.* They made the pragmatic choice to build for real users, not ideals, and onboarded millions because of it.

[**Privy**](https://www.privy.io/) is arguably one of the most successful wallets in crypto. Its mission is to bring people onchain, and I’ve heard dozens of founders say it’s the best thing that’s happened to the industry in years. Yet it doesn’t have a token, it isn’t *“crypto-native,”* and it relies heavily on AWS to store user keys \[1\]. Its CEO and co-founder, [Henri Stern](https://sequoiacap.com/founder/henri-stern/), spent four years as a protocol research engineer at FileCoin, a project that embodied true crypto ideals. That experience likely gave him a clear sense of when decentralization helps and when it only slows you down. Privy succeeded by focusing on the user experience over crypto ideals.

**In crypto, pragmatism isn’t about compromise, it’s about sequencing. You can decentralize later. You can tokenize later. But you have to survive in the beginning.**

# It’s Never That Simple

Failure can hinge on one thing. Success demands a harmonic symphony: UI, UX, timing, execution, luck. All must play in tune.

Most people in the OG crypto space start with ideals. That’s good as it draws in smart, mission-driven people. But idealism alone doesn’t build resilient systems.

**Pragmatism doesn’t guarantee success. Idealism often guarantees failure.**

The only true exceptions? Bitcoin and Ethereum. \[2\]

# A Thought to End On

**Decentralization is a byproduct of a permissionless and incentivized system.** It’s an end to a means, not a means to an end.

A fully privacy-preserving, decentralized, permissionless world sounds perfect in theory. In practice, it stalls progress, innovation, and usability.

In crypto, as in life, **survival belongs to the pragmatists.**

# tl;dr How to Bias Toward Pragmatism over Idealism

1. **Don’t tokenize too early.** Start with stablecoins or fiat rails.
2. **Don’t decentralize too early.** Use centralized infra, design for later decentralization.

I'd like to setup a recurring Bitcoin purchase (ie. daily automatic purchase). I haven't found the option to do so on the Kraken Pro app. I did find it on normal Kraken app, but it charges a fee of around 1% per purchase, which I believe is too high.

Is there any way to setup a recurring purchase without fees or with lower ones? Is this possible with Kraken or I should use another exchange / app?

1otf8h6,Announcing the MON public sale: the first ever token sale on Coinbase,"**TLDR:** *Monad is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain engineered for speed without sacrificing security or decentralization, all while maintaining full compatibility with the existing Ethereum ecosystem. MON is the Monad network’s native token, used to pay gas fees, secure the chain via staking, and align validators, developers, and users around the growth of the protocol.*

*Coinbase token sales has provided a platform for the Monad Foundation to distribute MON through a public sale via its subsidiary, MF Services (BVI), Ltd., enabling the purchase of MON tokens right before the launch of Monad Public Mainnet on November 24th, 2025. It will open on Monday, November 17th, 2025 at 9:00 AM ET and run until Saturday, November 22nd, 2025 at 9:00 PM ET. Those interested in learning more or participating in the public sale can do so* [*here*](https://www.coinbase.com/token-sales/monad)*.*

*Monad’s mission is to power a new world economy, suitable for a world that is increasingly online and onchain, through state of the art financial infrastructure. Monad will execute on this vision through three overarching pillars:*

*1. Enabling the Best Experience for Developers*

*2. Global Reach and Impact*

*3. Best-in-Class Technology*

**Monad’s Mission**

On November 24th, the world will witness the culmination of several years of technological innovation and engineering when the Monad Public Mainnet launches along with its native network token, MON. Monad is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain engineered for speed without sacrificing security or decentralization, all while maintaining full compatibility with the existing Ethereum ecosystem.

From the beginning, the Monad team has always been focused on building tomorrow’s tech, today. The mission is to power a new world economy, suitable for a world that is increasingly online and onchain, through state of the art financial infrastructure.

Success requires disruption. The north star is to see the entire global population utilizing applications built on top of Monad. These applications are uniquely enabled and powered by Monad and have the potential to improve lives. An exceptionally performant blockchain that is also decentralized can unlock new app experiences and use cases while also substantially improving the experience of existing ones. However, increased performance without compromising decentralization is the ultimate unlock. It allows for a censorship-resistant blockchain that can withstand the test of time. Operating through intense geopolitical turmoil, banking the unbanked, and serving the needs of global citizens are ideals that have true staying power in an ever-evolving world.

Monad will execute on this vision through three overarching pillars:

1. Enabling the Best Experience for Developers
2. Global Reach and Impact
3. Best-in-Class Technology

**Enabling the Best Experience for Developers**

Monad’s success depends on a thriving ecosystem of applications and developers. This is only possible when Monad is the premier place to build and deploy applications. EVM compatibility already reduces the bulk of friction for developers, but initiatives like [Monad Madness](https://madness.monad.xyz/) and the [Monad Founder Residency](https://residency.monad.xyz/) connected founders with world-class investors to gain invaluable exposure and funding to jumpstart their businesses. Accelerators like [Mach](https://mach.monad.xyz/) expedited the speed at which developers and project teams were able to ship initial proof of concepts and hit the ground running.

Physical spaces like [The Studio](https://x.com/thestudio_xyz) and The Founder Lounge have allowed builders to engage in thoughtful discussions around building startups and exchange valuable knowledge with industry veterans. Meetups organized by Monad community members have created a network of globally distributed advocates for the protocol.

All of these exemplify why the Monad ecosystem is conducive to innovative applications and killer businesses that will drive forward the evolution of Monad’s onchain economy. One that is permissionless and accessible to developers around the world.

**Global Reach and Impact**

While there have been substantial technological improvements across the crypto industry in the past decade, there is still a significant gap to bridge between market needs and the complexity of blockchain technology. The addressable market in crypto will become much larger by meeting users where they are.

This requires global expansion and stronger distribution that is both relevant and accessible. As the number of use cases continues to grow, new audiences and end users are emerging for crypto applications. Financial institutions are increasingly leveraging blockchain technology because of its greater effectiveness compared to legacy systems. Latin America is experiencing an explosion in payments adoption as users migrate online and move towards stablecoins. Southeast Asia is seeing strong growth in enterprise opportunities for blockchains with increasing demand for digital currencies.

We hope to see the Monad ecosystem embed itself across these geographies and userbases to generate the largest impact possible, empowering both developers and users alike. 

**Best-in-Class Technology**

The design of the Monad blockchain centers around the most important vectors for application development:

1. **EVM Compatibility:** Monad is designed to reduce developer friction. Monad’s re-architecture of the EVM perfected the work of predecessors at Ethereum while maintaining easy access to a vast developer ecosystem and tooling. Instead of forcing developers to learn a new programming language, Monad is molded around their needs.
2. **Performance:** Technical innovations like a custom database ([MonadDB](https://monad-docs.vercel.app/monad-arch/execution/monaddb)) and execution optimizations ([Optimistic Parallel Execution](https://blog.monad.xyz/blog/how-monad-works#optimistic-parallel-execution)) have allowed Monad to achieve the speed necessary for mainstream applications. The Monad architecture was designed from the ground up to enable use cases like High-frequency trading (HFT) and consumer applications that were not feasible before due to performance limitations. 
3. **Decentralization:** Performance alone without decentralization opens up a blockchain to censorship concerns. Monad’s new software algorithms and a globally distributed network of validators make the blockchain resistant to censorship while providing durable access to a range of necessary services for users around the world.

The challenge for any blockchain has been the blockchain trilemma: how to optimize for security, scalability, and decentralization while balancing heavy tradeoffs. Instead, Monad solved the blockchain trilemma by pushing the boundaries of what is possible with innovative technology. Our hope is that Monad will only continue to grow more performant and decentralized over time. And now it is time to open Monad up to the world.

**Public sale on Coinbase token sales platform**

Decentralization is only possible with widely distributed ownership of the MON token. A healthy ecosystem consists not only of developers and users, but also tokenholders. We are pleased to share that Coinbase has provided a platform for the Monad Foundation to distribute MON through a [public sale](http://coinbase.com/blog/the-ideal-way-to-launch-introducing-token-sales-on-coinbase) by its subsidiary, MF Services (BVI), Ltd. 

The Coinbase token sales platform brings public sales to retail purchasers in the US and globally, allowing for smaller allocations across more participants. The public sale will enable the purchase of MON tokens right before the launch of Monad Public Mainnet on November 24th, 2025. It will open on Monday, November 17th, 2025 at 9:00 AM ET and run until Saturday, November 22nd, 2025 at 9:00 PM ET.

MON is the Monad network’s native token, used to pay gas fees, secure the chain via staking, and align validators, developers, and users around the growth of the protocol. At the launch of Monad Public Mainnet, the total initial supply of MON will be 100 billion tokens. Up to 7.5B $MON tokens (7.5% of initial token supply) will be made available to the public for purchase in the public sale at a price of $0.025 per token. The Coinbase token sales platform accommodates a minimum bid size of $100 and a maximum bid size of $100,000 (subject to higher maximum thresholds for Coinbase One subscribers pursuant to the Coinbase token sale platform terms).

Following completion of the public sale, coincident with the launch of Monad Mainnet, MON tokens will be distributed to purchasers. If the public sale is undersubscribed, any unsold tokens will be reallocated to ecosystem development. If the total number of requested tokens is greater than the total available tokens, a distribution mechanism called “filling up from the bottom,” will create a broad distribution among sale participants and limit asset concentration among large purchasers. Additional details on MON tokenomics are available in the [MON Tokenomics Overview](https://www.monad.xyz/announcements/mon-tokenomics-overview).

1ostkqu,Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Contract holds almost 60% of all ETH - heres who really controls Ethereum,"So Arkham Intelligence just dropped some interesting data about who actually holds the most Ethereum and its not what most people think.

The Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Deposit Contract now holds around 72.4 million ETH which is almost 60% of the current total supply. Thats worth about 250 billion dollars at current prices. This is basically all the ETH that validators have deposited to secure the network under proof of stake.

What makes this kinda ironic is Ethereum was supposed to be super decentralized but having that much pooled in staking contracts shows how security has shifted towards a few big staking setups and protocols instead of tons of small solo holders. Whether thats good or bad depends on your perspective.

For individual holders the biggest known private owner is Rain Lohmus who bought 250k ETH back in 2014 for just 75k dollars. Problem is he lost his private keys so that roughly 871 million dollars worth of ETH is basically stuck unless he somehow recovers them. Brutal. Vitalik Buterin the co founder holds about 240k ETH.

on the institutional side binance controls around 4.09 million eth… blackrocks ishare ethereum trust etf sits on about 3.94 million and coinbase holds roughly 3.5 million across its custodial and staking wallets… other big exchanges like upbit kraken and okx are also major holders… for regular folks juggling exchange wallets staking and maybe an etf too… i just pipe everything into awaken tax monthly so cost basis and lots stay clean instead of turning into a year end headache

Theres even some weird stuff like the US government holding around 60k ETH mostly from seized funds. Plus a wallet tied to the 2016 Gatecoin hack is still sitting on more than 156k ETH from that exploit.

Bottom line is staking contracts exchanges ETF issuers and custody platforms now dominate Ethereum holdings.

Crypto & Fintech Writer | Blockchain Journalist | Technical Writer.

*November 5th, 2025*

# A Line in the Sand for Blockchain History

On *November 3, 2025*, Algorand quietly achieved something no blockchain had ever done before: it executed the *world’s first post-quantum transaction* on its mainnet.

No simulation, no sandbox. A real transaction, secured by ***Falcon-1024 signatures***, now lives immutably on the Algorand ledger, a transaction that even the world’s most advanced future quantum computer couldn’t break.

For context, this isn’t just a technical milestone. It’s a statement of intent, one that reshapes what blockchain security means in an era where quantum computing is no longer science fiction but an approaching inevitability.

*“This isn’t theory anymore,”* I added. *“Algorand has crossed the bridge. The rest of the industry is still building.”*

# Why Quantum Resistance Matters

To understand why this moment matters, you need to understand the risk. Nearly every blockchain today, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even most of the newer ones, relies on *RSA* or *elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)* to verify ownership and authenticate transactions. These systems work beautifully against classical computers.

But against a quantum computer? They crumble.

Since *Peter Shor’s algorithm* in ***1994*** proved that a sufficiently powerful quantum machine could factor large numbers or compute discrete logarithms instantly, cryptographers have known what’s coming. It’s not a matter of *if*, but *when*.

The danger isn’t just futuristic. There’s what security experts call the *“harvest now, decrypt later”* problem. Bad actors can collect encrypted blockchain data today, store it, and wait until quantum machines mature, then decrypt everything at once.

When that day comes, every wallet, signature, and identity built on today’s encryption could be compromised.

This is why Algorand’s step isn’t about bragging rights. It’s about survival and foresight.

# Falcon: The Cryptographic Shield of the Future

At the heart of this breakthrough is ***Falcon,*** a lattice-based signature algorithm co-developed by cryptographic heavyweights like *Craig Gentry, Chris Peikert*, and *Vinod Vaikuntanathan,* with contributions from Algorand’s own *Dr. Zhenfei Zhang*.

Falcon, which stands for *Fast Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU*, was selected by *NIST in 2022* as a global standard for post-quantum digital signatures.

It’s efficient, compact, and incredibly hard to break even for quantum computers.

Falcon comes in two main versions:

* ***Falcon-512***, offering AES-128-level security.
* ***Falcon-1024***, providing AES-192-level strength — what NIST calls *“Level 5,”* the highest security tier available.

Algorand uses Falcon-1024. It’s the same signature scheme that already protects Algorand’s *state proofs,*compact cryptographic snapshots that allow other blockchains to verify Algorand’s state without intermediaries.

The genius here lies in Falcon’s balance:

* Its signatures are larger (around 1,280 bytes) but extremely fast to verify (under 100 microseconds).
* Signing takes more computation, but verification, the part blockchains do millions of times per day, is lightning-quick.

That trade-off is perfect for Algorand, where every block involves thousands of signature checks per second.

# Engineering the Impossible

Implementing Falcon in production wasn’t as simple as swapping one signature scheme for another.

Falcon uses *floating-point arithmetic* and *Fast Fourier transforms,* techniques that demand incredible numerical precision. One rounding error, and security could fail.

The Algorand Foundation’s team tackled this with a deterministic, constant-time implementation, ensuring no randomness or timing leaks that attackers could exploit.

Their guiding principles were clear:

1. ***No disruption to consensus:*** verification had to remain deterministic.
2. ***Seamless integration:*** of quantum-secure accounts is needed to act like normal ones.
3. ***Developer accessibility:*** the system should be easy to use and experiment with.

To achieve that, Algorand built something elegant: embedding Falcon keys inside *Logic Signatures* smart contracts that control how an account’s funds can be spent.

These contracts verify Falcon signatures over transaction IDs. If the math checks out, the spend is authorized.

From the network’s perspective, it looks no different from a traditional account only it’s *quantum-secure*.

# Building the Tools for a Quantum Future

To make this accessible, Algorand released the ***Falcon Signatures CLI,*** a command-line toolkit that lets developers actually create, fund, and transact from post-quantum accounts on mainnet or testnet.

Developers can:

* Generate Falcon keypairs
* Derive Algorand addresses from them
* Fund those addresses
* Sign and submit Falcon-verified transactions

In other words, anyone can now mint, sign, and send quantum-resistant transactions.

That’s not just innovation, it’s democratization of security.

# What’s Protected — and What Isn’t (Yet)

Algorand’s post-quantum rollout secures individual accounts and the blockchain’s historical state. State proofs — those compact summaries used by other chains — are now fully quantum-resistant.

But the *consensus layer* still relies on *Ed25519* signatures and **V***erifiable Random Functions (VRFs)* for validator selection. These are classical cryptographic mechanisms that quantum computers could theoretically exploit.

So while quantum attackers couldn’t steal funds from Falcon-secured accounts, they might still disrupt block proposals or manipulate future consensus events.

That’s why Algorand’s approach is *incremental but deliberate*: start with user-level protection, gain experience, then move up the stack toward quantum-secure consensus.

It’s the practical path to secure what’s possible now and evolve systematically.

# Falcon’s Broader Impact

Falcon’s adoption by Algorand has implications far beyond a single blockchain.

Because it’s *NIST-standardized*, Falcon can act as a *universal language* for cross-chain communication in a *post-quantum world.*

Algorand’s *state proofs*, already powered by Falcon, could allow other chains to verify data trustlessly with the same cryptographic standard, no intermediaries needed.

That sets the stage for a *quantum-resistant multichain future* where interoperability and security coexist instead of colliding.

The open-source Falcon CLI also invites global collaboration developers, cryptographers, even universities can study and improve the system freely.

# The Human Side: Algorand’s 2025 Roadmap

While the Falcon achievement represents Algorand’s technical peak, its *2025 roadmap* reveals something just as profound: a shift toward simplicity, usability, and community control.

In an industry drowning in jargon and fractured ecosystems, Algorand’s message is refreshingly human. The roadmap centers around three core goals:

1. ***Return power to the community***
2. ***Make blockchain development frictionless***
3. ***Deliver a user experience that feels like Web2 — but runs on Web3 principles***

# Community Takes the Wheel

Algorand is handing the steering wheel to its users.

Through *Project King Safety*, the network plans to redesign its fee and incentive model to ensure long-term sustainability, ending the era of foundation-subsidized economics. A position paper is due in *Q4 2025*, outlining how fees, validator rewards, and network incentives will evolve.

Even more transformative is the *revival of its grant program* under a *new governance structure.*

A community-elected *xGov Council* will now decide which projects get funding — removing centralized gatekeeping and restoring grassroots governance.

The foundation has already *reduced its stake from 63% to 21%* through a new rewards model, and a *peer-to-peer gossip network* is replacing its centralized relay architecture.

Each of these steps pushes Algorand closer to becoming a *fully peer-to-peer, self-governed ecosystem,*something most blockchains only claim to be.

# Simplifying the Developer Experience

The next frontier is making blockchain development as easy as writing a mobile app.

In *early 2026*, Algorand will launch *AlgoKit 4.0,* a major upgrade that introduces composable smart contract libraries, key-value storage *(“Schema”)*, and native support for mainstream languages like ***Rust****,* ***Swift***, and ***Kotlin***.

Developers will even be able to use ***AI assistants***, powered by large language models, to help write and debug contracts, merging artificial intelligence and blockchain into a single development flow.

*“Algorand is building a bridge for developers who don’t want to learn ten new programming languages just to build on Web3.”*

For enterprises, *Intermezzo*, debuting in *Q3 2025*, will handle all the hard stuff: key management, blockchain integration, and compliance. Businesses will be able to launch blockchain-backed loyalty programs, digital assets, or identity systems with almost no technical friction.

And for users? That’s where *Rocca Wallet* comes in.

# Rocca Wallet: Web3 Without the Headache

If Falcon is the brain of Algorand’s evolution, *Rocca Walle***t** is its face.

Set for *preview in Q4 2025* and an *open-source release in 2026*, Rocca aims to eliminate one of the biggest pain points in the crypto complex: intimidating wallets.

It supports *passkey logins* (no seed phrases), *fee abstraction* (users don’t even see *“gas*”), and *decentralized identity* (no centralized logins or data leaks).

It’s also *white-label*, meaning DApps can brand and customize it so the blockchain experience can fade into the background, letting usability take center stage.

In short, Rocca makes Web3 feel like Web2 only safer, faster, and fully decentralized.

# Powering the Real World

Algorand’s 2025 vision also extends beyond the screen. It’s targeting real industries where blockchain can quietly improve everyday life:

1. ***Tokenized Financial Products*****:** Using the *ACTUS framework*, Algorand is building smart contract models for tokenized debt and equity, with a *Debt ASA MVP* expected by *Q4 2025*.
2. ***Agentic Commerce*****:** Supporting AI agents that can transact autonomously via ***X402*** and *A2A payments,* blurring the line between AI and DeFi.
3. ***Self-Sovereign Identity*****:** The Rocca Wallet will enable verifiable credentials — like *WorldChess’s Universal Chess Passport*, which lets players compete globally without centralized logins.
4. ***Data Integrity*****:** Strengthening blockchain’s role as a permanent, verifiable record for supply chains, enterprises, and beyond.

# Privacy, Scalability, and the Quantum Edge

Algorand isn’t just catching up — it’s leaping ahead.

Its upgraded ***AlgoPlonk*** zero-knowledge system will make privacy faster and more flexible, while exploration into *multiparty computation (MPC)* and *fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)* lays the groundwork for transactions that remain private even while being processed.

Meanwhile, *parallel execution* and *block pipelining* are set to supercharge scalability, allowing multiple transactions to run at once and cutting block confirmation times even further.

And in the background, Falcon remains the silent guardian expanding from state proofs to user accounts, making Algorand one of the *first truly quantum-resistant blockchains on Earth.*

# How Algorand Could Shield Bitcoin and Other Networks from Quantum Threats

If the crypto industry ever faced a unified existential risk, it would be the moment a quantum computer gains the power to crack traditional cryptography. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and thousands of other networks rely on elliptic-curve signatures that a large enough quantum machine could break in hours.

But what if a blockchain already designed for quantum resistance could act as a *guardian layer,* a protective framework capable of verifying and securing other chains until they upgrade?

That’s precisely where ***Algorand*** could step in.

Through its ***Falcon-based state proofs*** and advanced cross-chain verification capabilities, Algorand could become a ***quantum-safe validation hub*****,** a kind of digital shield for legacy blockchains. Its post-quantum signatures could authenticate wrapped or bridged assets, allowing *BTC, ETH, or other vulnerable coins* to operate within a *quantum-secure environment* without needing to overhaul their original codebases overnight.

Imagine Bitcoin wrapped inside Algorand’s lattice-secured ecosystem, its ownership and movement verified by Falcon signatures, insulated from quantum decryption threats. The original Bitcoin chain could continue as it is, but its value, liquidity, and transaction flow could be mirrored through Algorand’s *quantum-proof framework,* preserving the integrity of BTC without disrupting its core protocol.

*“If Algorand were allowed to serve as a security layer for Bitcoin,”* I noted, *“it could buy the entire crypto industry time, maybe years, even decades to transition safely into a post-quantum era.”*

This kind of hybrid interoperability could extend to *stablecoins, NFTs, DeFi protocols, and cross-border payment rails* as well. Since Algorand’s state proofs already support *trustless communication across chains*, Falcon could underpin a multi-network safety web, one where any blockchain, even those not quantum-ready, could plug into Algorand for verification and data integrity.

It’s a bold idea, but one rooted in reality. Algorand’s technology isn’t just future-proofing itself; it could very well be *future-proofing everyone else*, too.

# Staying True to Web3’s Promise

While other networks chase hype cycles, Algorand is quietly rebuilding Web3 around its original ideals:

* *Transparency*
* *Security*
* *Community-led governance*
* *Sustainability*

Its uptime is near-flawless. Its scalability remains unmatched. And now, its cryptography is preparing for a world that doesn’t even exist yet.

# A Glimpse at the Horizon

Algorand’s latest moves, both technical and philosophical, signal a maturation of blockchain as an industry.

Falcon’s integration shows that cutting-edge cryptography can coexist with usability.  
The 2025 roadmap proves that decentralization and human-centered design aren’t opposites; they’re the same path forward.

Together, they redefine what *“Web3 readiness”* really means.

It’s not about speculation. It’s about *security that lasts decades, governance that empowers real people*, and *tools that anyone can use without a manual.*

Algorand’s post-quantum transaction didn’t just future-proof a blockchain, it *future-proofed the idea of trust itself.*

# The Final Word

For all the industry talk about quantum threats, decentralized AI, and next-gen networks, only one blockchain has proven it’s ready for the next era: Algorand.

From *Falcon’s lattice-based cryptography* to the *Rocca Wallet’s human-friendly design*, the network is merging the unthinkable military-grade security with intuitive simplicity.

*“What Algorand did isn’t just technical brilliance, it’s vision,”* I concluded. *“They’re showing the world that security, decentralization, and user experience can finally coexist. It’s the evolution Web3 has been waiting for.”*

# A Note on the Road Ahead

Quantum computers are coming. AI is accelerating.  
But for once, blockchain isn’t lagging behind innovation; it’s leading it.

And at the front of that pack, with its post-quantum Falcon wings already spread, stands ***Algorand.*** *Don’t give up on the underdog yet! This blockchain could surprise everyone at the end.*

Because the future doesn’t wait, and Algorand has decided it won’t either.

1orsiex,Ethereum’s Fragmented L2s Show First Signs of Acting Like One Network,"ZKSync’s Atlas upgrade has reached 15,000 transactions per second and about one-second finality between all ZK Stack chains. The system connects Ethereum’s mainnet and its L2s into a shared network where transactions and liquidity can move almost instantly while still settling back to Ethereum’s base layer.

Before Atlas, activity on rollups happened in isolation. Transfers between L2s required bridging, often taking hours or days. Atlas establishes ZK-verified communication between chains, removing those delays and giving Ethereum’s ecosystem near-instant internal synchronization.

Beyond throughput, Atlas also changes how capital moves onchain. Assets like ETH, USDC, or stETH can now remain on mainnet as live collateral while being used across connected chains. A trader on GRVT — the first exchange using Atlas — can post margin or settle trades backed directly by funds still held on Ethereum. Because of sub-second verification between L2s and roughly 10–15 minute L1 finality, positions can be updated and verified on Ethereum faster than any centralized exchange settlement.

Beyond GRVT, another project applies the same logic at a broader scale. Lighter’s Universal Cross Margin system extends the model, letting any Ethereum-based asset — including ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or lending positions — serve as trading collateral without leaving mainnet. The assets stay on Ethereum, continue to earn yield, and are referenced through zero-knowledge proofs on Lighter’s Layer 2.

Every operation, from order matching to liquidation, is verified cryptographically on Ethereum rather than through bridges or custodians. This turns Ethereum itself into the universal margin ledger while execution happens off-chain. The result is the same pattern seen with GRVT and Atlas: higher-performance layers forming around Ethereum without detaching from its security or liquidity base.

Across Layer 2 chains, we're seeing the first prototypes of cross-asset margining operating in real time. This promises a world where liquidity that was previously locked in silos can be used simultaneously on multiple venues. Each transaction updates instantly across the network, with Ethereum providing the final source of truth.

The effect is that the Ethereum ecosystem begins to operate less like it a collection of fragmented chains, and more like a single network of connected execution layers — each specialized, but all secured by the same base. Instead of competing L2s, Atlas and Lighter make them part of one market bus.

In parallel, EigenCloud demonstrates the same consolidation on the compute side. It turns Web2 backends into verifiable smart-contract services secured by Ethereum. It reduces the cost of launching decentralized applications by using ETH as the universal security bond and keeping familiar Web2 interfaces like email login or off-chain computation.

Together, these developments show Ethereum scaling by integration rather than duplication — bringing verifiable applications and high-throughput trading into a single security domain, with ETH as the settlement asset that connects them all.

1or8do9,Parallax (LAX) Combining Bitcoin Ethos With Ethereum Usability,"Parallax is a new blockchain that was launched on the 28th of October with its token being named LAX.

This is a Proof of Work blockchain that runs on the XHash algorithm being ASIC resistant for now, not allowing ASICs to overflow the initial hashrate. 

Parallax has a fixed supply of 21 million tokens and a 10 minute block time just like Bitcoin but it is a EVM compatible blockchain meaning that it can be highly progamable like Ethereum. It's important to note that there was no premine and the main developer didn't take any allocation of the first issued tokens to himself, allowing miners to distribute all the rewards.

LAX preserves the cypherpunk Ethos aiming to be highly decentralized and community driven. It also allows to combine Bitcoin's fixed rules for money with Ethereum progammable environment.

Being full EVM compatible allows users to add the wallet straight to Metamask using the following instructions to create a custom network in Metamask.

Network name: Parallax

RPC: https://rpc.parallaxchain.org

Chain ID: 2110

Symbol: LAX

Explorer: https://explorer.parallaxchain.org

After adding this to Metamask, users all fully able to send, receive and sign transactions in Metamask.

Although it's in its infancy, LAX has already gather the attention of many small exchanges and has a respectfull volume right now, the price is about 0.5$ per LAX at the time of writing and the hashrate has been constantly rising in the last few days. Listing in Safe Trade is already confirmed and should be done in a few days, being a much larger exchange it should attract a lot more volume to LAX.

Parallax is different from the usual launch of coins because of its fair launch and deserves being named just because of its fairness in a world populated with VCs and premined cryptocurrencies.

All the details about the blockchain can be found on https://parallaxchain.org.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1or8do9/parallax_lax_combining_bitcoin_ethos_with/,speedfire21,0,1,0.42,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1762554576.0,2025-11-07T22:29:36

1or1blk,Satoshis weakest but most misquoted quote.,"> If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry

Is often quoted when people don't believe the claim that it will go up forever. But did you know the full context of the quote?


Faced with the now all too well known criticism of Bitcoin: Network speed and 10min blocktime

he replied:


> The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

> See the snack machine thread, I outline how a payment processor could verify payments well enough, actually really well (much lower fraud rate than credit cards), in something like 10 seconds or less.  If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.
