Following last week’s bitcoin price drop to around $80,000, large traders increased the amount of bitcoin they sent to exchanges, according to onchain analytics firm CryptoQuant.

The firm said the total number of bitcoin transferred to exchanges reached 9,000
 BTC +3.04%
 on Nov. 21, with 45% of that volume coming from large deposits of 100 BTC or more — a level it described as unusually high.

""This is evident in the average BTC deposit value shooting up to 1.23 BTC in November, the highest level in a year, from 0.6 BTC just a
week ago,"" CryptoQuant said. ""This indicates that large deposits are leading exchange inflows, increasing the average deposit.""",https://www.theblock.co/post/380642/cryptoquant-bitcoin-ether-altcoins-exchange-deposits-prices,setokaiba22,2,1,0.6,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764203453.0,2025-11-27T00:30:53
