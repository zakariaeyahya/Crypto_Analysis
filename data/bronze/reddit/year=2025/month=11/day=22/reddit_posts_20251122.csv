“…Strategy Inc. just disclosed something extraordinary. They own 649,870 Bitcoin. That is 3.26 percent of every Bitcoin that will ever exist. Total cost: $48.37 billion.

They also disclosed the numbers that prove this cannot survive the next 90 days….”

“…Strategy has $54 million in cash. They owe $700 million per year in preferred stock dividends. Their software business generates negative cash flow. To pay dividends, they must raise $700 million in new capital every single year before buying a single additional Bitcoin...”

1p5b4di,What will be effect of next rate cut?,"With talks of a possible interest rate cut by the Fed (or other major central banks), I'm curious how this could impact Bitcoin. Historically, lower rates can increase liquidity, weaken the dollar, and push investors toward riskier assets like crypto—but there are also scenarios where uncertainty or weak economic signals could suppress BTC.

For those following macro trends and crypto markets: how do you expect the next rate cut to affect Bitcoin prices?

1p4sd0d,Going into my third Bear Market,"I’ve been in this game a while now, heading into my third crypto bear market. Honestly, it feels like we’re already at the start of the next one and could be stuck in it for the next year.

I’m curious: how many of you are selling now and planning to buy back in later, and how many are just planning to hold? History shows a pattern, and the odds are that Bitcoin follows it again. So what’s your reasoning, why sell, or why hold?

I’m undecided, but leaning towards selling and buying back in lower unlikely last time.

1p4l1go,A Post Mortem: This is why your altcoin died this cycle,"The 2022-2025 cycle was rough for altcoin holders. Even as Bitcoin kept hitting new all-time highs, most altcoins kept bleeding.

People say that money moves from Bitcoin → Ethereum → large caps → small caps → microcaps. But here's the rub: that pattern only really works when interest rates are low and the Fed is doing QE. It DOES NOT apply when interest rates are 4-5% and the Fed is doing QT.

**The 2021 setup: 0-0.25% rates + QE**

In 2021, interest rates were basically zero. Inflation was around 2-3%, so holding cash felt like slowly losing money. So everyone - regular folks and institutions alike - wanted higher returns.

They put money into anything that earned more than 2%. A lot of this money flowed into crypto through DeFi. This pushed up the TVL of nearly every goddamn protocol. It was an era of easy money, so even stupid NFTs could sell for a million bucks.

**The turning point: October 2021 CPI report**

Before the October CPI report, the Federal Reserve kept saying inflation was transitory. On 10 November 2021, we saw a CPI reading of 6.2%. At that point, it was clear inflation wasn't going away. The Fed had to do a full 180 and HIKE BABY HIKE.

That October CPI report was the exact moment that triggered the 2022 market crash, because it signalled the Fed had to pivot.

**The 2022-2025 cycle**

In this cycle, inflation has been hovering around 2-3%, but interest rates have been 4-5%. You can get that sweet-ass 4-5% just by putting money in a high-yield savings account. That means people can earn 1-3% above inflation by doing nothing. There's very little reason for anyone to put money into DeFi.

With low DeFi TVL and no hype, Ethereum-like chains that depend on DeFi basically all died. This is why your altcoin died.

**Altcoins that did work in 2022-2025**

Some examples:

SOL: \~$9 → $200+

RAY: \~$0.15 → \~$7.50

PENDLE: \~$0.05 → \~$7

INJECTIVE: \~$1.30 → $40+

ROLLBIT: \~$0.002 → $0.20+

**What do all these have in common? Leverage.**

RAY lets you buy SOL memecoins that can 10x-100x fast. You need SOL for gas. PENDLE lets you make big gains when DeFi interest rates move from 2% to 4%. HELIX on INJECTIVE gives you up to 50x leverage on crypto futures. ROLLBIT is a crypto casino that also offers leveraged crypto futures.

People still want chances to double their money or more in a year. They do not care about 5-8% returns. Protocols that turn greed into revenue do fantastic, but everything else fails.

**If you want to do well next cycle;**

Either stick to Bitcoin, **OR** focus on protocols that offer some form of leverage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p4l1go/a_post_mortem_this_is_why_your_altcoin_died_this/,RatherCynical,0,22,0.29,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1763899276.0,2025-11-23T12:01:16
