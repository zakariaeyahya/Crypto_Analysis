1p3vakd,"A Maximum Number of Bitcoins isn't a Perk, it's a Fatal Flaw","During this pullback people are being reminded why BTC is a good investment: there can only ever be 21,000,000 so it won't be subject to inflation. Ok, but that's just trading one problem for an even bigger one. It's a near mathematical certainty the number of BTC in circulation will be zero at some point.

P1. Eventually it won't be possible to put anymore BTC into circulation. 

P2. Some amount of BTC will always be removed from circulation (People dying without passing their coins on, losing their keys, etc)

Conclusion: The total number of BTC in circulation will eventually be zero.

Yea, 21,000,000 is a big number and it might take a while to reach zero, but it'll eventually reach zero, and becomes less and less useful along the way as less and less can be circulated. Of course, the use of BTC and its speculative value don't have to be directly associated, but so far the argument seems to be BTC will eventually be useful so we should value it high now, but even if it becomes useful it'll become useless bc of the points above.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p3vakd/a_maximum_number_of_bitcoins_isnt_a_perk_its_a/,CalaisZetes,0,26,0.21,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1763823604.0,2025-11-22T15:00:04
1p3s4bu,How vulnerable are dormant crypto holdings in the post quantum era?,"Many blockchains assume a future upgrade to post quantum security will simply protect everyone. That assumption breaks down for coins in wallets that can no longer sign anything. Lost keys. Abandoned wallets. People who have died. Early miner rewards. Any address type that has already revealed its public key.

These holdings cannot upgrade and they cannot defend themselves.

Bitcoin is a prime example. Some of the earliest coins use P2PK address formats where the public key is already visible on chain. If a quantum computer becomes capable of breaking ECDSA, those coins are immediate targets. Taproot becomes exposed as soon as it receives funds. Legacy and SegWit have time based protection only because their public key is revealed when spending.

Here is a summary of current situation:

https://preview.redd.it/mltb1297xs2g1.jpg?width=809&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a09e7739119c2515c826d1ccd76bbf7db30b5bff

If practical quantum computers appear before a coordinated migration, dormant and unmaintained coins are the first in line to be drained. They are easy to identify and impossible to secure.

Key questions for long term holders and protocol developers:

• What happens when keys cannot be rotated?  
• Should there be a preemptive plan for permanently inaccessible coins?  
• How does the network react if thousands of old UTXOs begin to move under attacker control?  
• Is post quantum secure technology already available and would integrating it materially change the blockchain today?

This is not a fringe scenario. It is a structural risk and it deserves serious attention.

1p3jvz4,Must Read,"A massive, mostly hidden power struggle is happening right now over who controls the future of money in America. On one side are the old guard JPMorgan, Wall Street, and the Federal Reserve who have run the dollar system for decades and make huge profits from it. 
On the other side are the Trump administration and the U.S. Treasury, who want to take that power back by issuing new digital dollars (stablecoins) and quietly backing them with Bitcoin instead of letting banks create money out of thin air.

Bitcoin has become the main battleground; the old system is allegedly using every trick (fake paper contracts, short-selling, custody delays) to keep the price suppressed, while the new side wants to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible on the cheap before revealing the plan. MicroStrategy is caught in the crossfire because it’s currently the easiest way for big institutions to get Bitcoin exposure, making it a key “bridge” the old guard is trying to burn down. The whole fight is playing out on a fragile, over-leveraged financial system, and the next 1–3 years will decide whether we stay in the 1971–2024 money regime or flip to something completely new.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p3jvz4/must_read/,pugella,0,13,0.26,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1763784976.0,2025-11-22T04:16:16
1p3ifas,Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki just sold 2.25 million dollars worth of crypto,"he just announced he sold about 2.25 million dollars worth of Btc on Friday. He said he originally bought those coins years ago when BTC was around 6000 and sold near 90k so he locked in a pretty massive gain. He did not clearly say this was his entire BTC stack, just that he sold this amount.

Whats interesting is hes not selling because he thinks Btc done. He says hes reinvesting the proceeds into two surgery centers and a billboard business that he estimates will generate about 27500 dollars in tax free monthly income by February 2026.

He also said hes still very bullish and optimistic on Bitcoin and plans to start buying again using the cash flow from those businesses. Earlier this month he repeated his view that BTC could hit around 250k by 2026.

The timing is what caught people off guard tho. This comes right as Bitcoin dumped into the mid 80k range this week and briefly traded in the low 80ks intraday before bouncing back. We are now down a bit over 30 percent from the October all time high around 126k.

The Fear and Greed Index hit 11 on Friday which is extreme fear territory and one of the lowest readings this year. Some people are genuinely worried we are sliding into a deeper bear phase.

But some analysts including Bitfinex commentators have framed the ETF outflows and this downturn as short term stress in positioning and macro, not necessarily a full breakdown of long term institutional interest. And veteran trader Peter Brandt still thinks Bitcoin reaches 200k in the next cycle, roughly around Q3 2029.

So Kiyosakis move seems more tactical than anything. Take profits when theyre there, reinvest in cash flowing assets, then buy back later when you have stable income.

The market makers don’t want you in the game anymore.

If you look at it from a psychological perspective, this is exactly how it appears to me:  
Bitcoin has dropped below 100k and can’t even manage to reclaim 100k, 90k, or right now even the 85k level.  
Sounds like every reason to get out, right?

In my view, this is nothing but psychological terror.  
All the money that just got liquidated can flow right back into the market at any moment – maybe partially, maybe in huge chunks, or even all at once.

1p2ug6i,The road to 1 million = centralisation of BTC,"The real BTC cycle now isn’t price, it’s mining. There are three tiers of institutional mining - tier 3 these guys operate on old equipment and they spend 60-90k per BTC mined. These guys are beginning to fall into trouble. The longer we linger around  these price levels and operating at a loss, eventually they will capitulate, this creates a cascading effect to a point where if we see 45k BTC this bear, ALL tier 3 and many tier 2 Mining firms die or are close to dying. Tier 1 mining firms with the best equipment at this point will survive indefinitely.

As tier 3 and tier 2 mining firms die off, the Hash rate and difficulty to mine BTC also falls off a cliff, this allows Tier 1 mining firms to grow exponentially; eating all the tier 2 mining companies that go bust.

We are inevitably faced with the elephant in the room. This is the Cycle where the ultra rich take over BTC. we will find ourselves in a position that the majority of Bitcoins Hashrate will be in the hands of just a few entities.

1p2fotg,The Crypto Collapse: 45 Days From $126K BTC to a Mechanical Meltdown,"The crypto collapse:  
  
On October 6th, just 45 days ago, Bitcoin hit a record high of $126,272, worth $2.5 trillion.  
  
Then, something ""mechanical"" seems to have shifted on October 10th, after President Trump threatened 100% tariffs on China.  
  
Not only did this lead to the record -$19.2 billion liquidation, but Bitcoin never truly recovered.  
  
Even when the October 30th trade deal was reached between the US and China, liquidation pressures only worsened.  
  
Then, since November 10th, Bitcoin has moved in a literal straight-line lower with average daily liquidations nearing $1 billion.  
  
Throughout the course of this 45-day bear market, crypto has seen little to no bearish fundamental developments.  
  
We continue to believe this is a mechanical bear market driven by excessive levels of leverage and sporadic liquidations.  
  
The market is efficient. It will iron itself out.

1p1j729,The October 10th crash is still killing institutional demand and its getting worse,"Bitcoin is back around the 90k level after dipping below it again this week and honestly the damage from that October 10th liquidation event is still haunting the market. We are down nearly 30 percent from the roughly 126k high and the move has basically erased this years gains.

That crash triggered over 19 billion dollars in forced liquidations over roughly a 24 hour window the largest wipeout the crypto market has ever seen. Since then institutional style demand has clearly weakened. Spot bitcoin ETFs flipped from steady inflows to heavy outflows with BlackRocks iShares Bitcoin Trust seeing about 523 million dollars leave in a single day this week its biggest daily outflow since launch.

What makes this worse is people are still using high leverage trying to time the bottom. Open interest in bitcoin perpetual futures on major venues like Binance jumped by more than 36k BTC last week worth over 3.3 billion dollars the biggest weekly increase since April 2023 according to K33 Research.

K33 is warning that perp open interest has reached its October peak again which systematically increases the risk of another squeeze. They argue a lot of this leverage came from resting limit orders to buy the dip near the recent lows that got filled as price slid with no real bounce leaving traders in leveraged positions they werent really prepared for. Historically when this kind of setup shows up bitcoin tends to lose more ground K33 notes that in six out of seven similar regimes over the past five years BTC went on to fall over the next month with average 30 day returns around minus 16 percent.

This is also the kind of market that quietly turns into a tax nightmare later because people are churning positions with tiny pnl swings and a lot of leverage. I have been using awaken lately to keep all the trades and liquidations in one place for 8949 and schedule d so future me doesnt have to reconstruct this chaos from old csvs.

1p130hg,The emperor has no clothes,"I know I will be roasted for this MY OPINION. But I don't care, it's my thinking. Nobody cares either when people shill their bags.

Crypto is not a regular market. Ups and downs are normal for markets. But regular markets have underlying real, tangible value. Stuff. There's no stuff behind 95% (made up figure to make my point) of crypto.

Crypto is rather gambling. And as such, it doesn't need to be overly regulated or even banned. But gambling is very different than a market. Especially psychologically to people. It's definitely NO economic game changer. Try your luck at your own risk.

As it's purely digital and virtual, there's no bottom and there's no roof at to where the price can go. Which swings widely and wlidly mostly on pure sentiment. There's no real economic metric underpinning the movements. There are not a whole lot of economy affecting jobs (well, devs, influencers, comms managers, marketing for sure) behind it, nor materials, nor services. Not even utility!

There are a handful of exceptions. Bitcoin of course can be perceived as digital gold. But it's not doing a great job at it. Unlike physical gold, bitcoin can go as low as it gets. It's price is too speculative to function as gold. Every asset sees price moves, but from a digital gold - by MY INDIVIDUAL expectation  - I expect SOME stability and predictability. And right when I need my asset to give me stability - in terms of hedging when things look concerning - it tanks. It goes up when everything else goes up. That's NOT the utility of digital gold -> I <‐ am looking for.

Some other coins have a bit of utility. Ethereum is hailed for its smart contracts - but it's mainly used for DeFi. Shuffling more virtual stuff around to make virtual profits (or losses) which you can ephimerally make. How's that different from gambling?

Avalanche and a few other coins made one right move: anker their utility in real world stuff (RWA). But their market power is too weak to move on their own, and thus are subject to the general sentiments. Plus, regulatory and legal hurdles,  but also the actual handling of fractional or digitized ownership for people, needs more maturing.

Therefore I conclude: crypto degenerated into (mostly) pure gambling. Mind you, no newcomer here, first heard about bitcoin in 2012. I was concerned about its energy use back then, or I would be rich now. But that's a different story.

The emperor has no clothes. But of course the shillers and whales don't want you to believe that.  

The problem is not the tech. I entered crypto because of its, well, liberating *potential*. But as always, the problem is the use humans give to tech. It could be used differently but 99% are not interested.

1p117i4,Markets Struggling Nvidia Could Influence Tech and Bitcoin,"a strong nvidia report today could completely change market sentiment in a flash. this is the moment. markets are beaten down, bitcoin is sitting at 90k with full resistance waiting impatiently for a spark. if nvidia shows big growth and demand, it will not just move prices slightly, it can trigger a full rebound in risk assets. nvidia sets the tone for the AI sector, and every major fund is watching closely. a solid report could instantly bring liquidity and confidence back into tech and flow straight into bitcoin.

for multiple quarters now, nvidia’s earnings reports have reverberated through the corridors of cryptocurrency speculation. intriguingly, since the onset of 2023, the relationship has revealed itself clearly: bitcoin has rallied in 7 out of 10 quarters post-nvidia announcements. such consistent patterns bring forth a tantalizing hypothesis for traders. experts argue that nvidia’s bullish quarterly outcomes typically resonate positively with bitcoin, sparking optimism among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and hinting that a vibrant nvidia could flicker a spark in the broader appetite for risk across digital assets.

bitcoin reacts directly to risk sentiment. when tech struggles, bitcoin usually drops with it. but when a leader like nvidia sends a strong signal, bitcoin is often the first to ride the upside wave.

the AI market is still young and far from any bubble behavior. the dot com era had companies with zero revenue being valued in the hundreds of millions. today AI companies are generating billions per year and are moving closer to fully covering maintenance costs with real revenue. there is real demand, real growth, and real money behind the sector.

1p0cy8r,Binance 10·10 Matching Engine Outage: The Silenced Truth,"At 5:00 AM Beijing time (5:00 PM Eastern), buy orders on Binance began to be massively withdrawn.  
Bitcoin and altcoins entered a 20-minute free fall — the entire Binance order book collapsed.  
The issue was not that the whole market lacked buyers.  
The question is: **why did only Binance’s buy orders disappear?**  
Binance’s buy-side depth was significantly lower than other exchanges.

In traditional markets (like NASDAQ or other U.S. stock exchanges), such a “vacuum” is almost impossible — and certainly not isolated to a single venue.

**1. The Strongest Evidence Available Online (Data Acquisition Authenticity Screen-Recorded)**

  
Below is BTC/USDT perpetual futures order book data **a few hours before the incident**.  
  The green line represents bids, the red line represents asks — a symmetrical structure with bids decreasing and asks increasing.

https://preview.redd.it/s5cexwd3v02g1.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=889447ace0c4e0db2006acbce44f9639de658018

Around **4:55**, a small portion of bids exceeded asks, but there was still sufficient buying depth.

https://preview.redd.it/d9ueiiugv02g1.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fe64bc8deedb53c1c461290092006f6d62dbfdb



By By **5:10**, the bids and asks visibly crossed — a prolonged crossed market, signaling matching engine failure.

https://preview.redd.it/g3s9vrrkv02g1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=52abac7c28a9e9d84fae4bb833c9357360f2f7b3

Around **5:20**, which marked the lowest prices across many coins, altcoin bids fell into a complete vacuum.  
  It’s estimated that **most matching shards were entirely frozen**.  
   
Both the **Order Ingress Queue** and **matching queue** were heavily congested.

https://preview.redd.it/1hol53hsv02g1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=d879dd50dc18a16b80291981c3f6c838f1f44bbc

**The engine could not process incoming orders in time.**  
 Binance’s core trading system suffered a severe breakdown.  
 In short: old bids were withdrawn, new bids couldn’t enter — prices went   into free fall.  


**2. Major Market Makers' Cross-Exchange Trading Locked Down—Twilight of the Gods**

After buy-side liquidity vanished, major market makers who should have been obligated to provide quotes and support the market faced cross-exchange trading difficulties due to Binance's withdrawal congestion. Market makers like Wintermute, with priority channels and high-speed order placement capabilities, can normally execute even during extreme conditions when the matching engine is overloaded. However, their liquidity is limited. After Binance's order book issues caused price crashes, Wintermute's CEO described being unable to withdraw coins purchased on Binance to sell on Coinbase—preventing them from obtaining funds to redeposit on Binance to maintain buy-side support.

For example, DOGE fell to $0.095 on Binance, while it was $0.17 on Coinbase at the same time.  
    
If Binance hadn't experienced various technical issues, would a ""buy-side vacuum"" really occur? The answer is clearly no. Consider normal market conditions: when Galaxy Digital sold 80,000 BTC, Bitcoin dropped from $118,000 to $115,000. On October 11, with no major on-chain anomalies detected, Bitcoin plummeted from $117,000 to $101,500 in 30 minutes.  
  The market's strong buying pressure with nowhere to go was also reflected in the options market—   
   
\- Almost all sell-side liquidity disappeared in the options market; -  
   
  Option buy orders continued stacking up, with actual transaction prices far exceeding fair values calculated by the Black-Scholes model.   
\- Orders were mostly from professional quantitative institutions; whenever someone posted a remotely reasonable sell price, it was immediately swept by bots.

In other words, people wanting to buy never truly disappeared—they simply couldn't buy due to various technical reasons. 。 If you could buy ATOM at $0.0001, wouldn't you? Obviously you would. Now let's examine the situation for ordinary quant firms and retail traders at the bottom of the food chain.



**3、 Quants and Retail Wiped Out Without Priority Exchange Access**

During this trading anomaly, without access to low-latency matching channels, quant traders and retail investors were completely locked out of the system.  
   
Multiple market maker friends reported experiencing hundreds of order retry attempts during the incident. Even ReduceOnly orders (the highest system priority for position reduction) couldn't execute, continuously encountering 503 (Service Unavailable) and -1008 (Service Overloaded) errors—all fully logged. ReduceOnly orders failed to go through; Taker and Maker orders had even less chance.. Bottom-fishing buy orders were universally rejected.  


https://preview.redd.it/hkcgf9w9w02g1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7454ee08c0e52a85c6c87ee1f487744ac42f02f

In the end, retail traders—who understood the underlying truth least and created no pressure on the overloaded system—were labeled ""gamblers"" and bore the greatest losses. Their margin was carved up by counterparties and the exchange.

  
**4、 Collapse of Fake Liquidity**

Does Binance engage in wash trading?  
  My answer: 100% yes.  
   
Especially among altcoins that crashed to near-zero during the 10·11 incident — such as ATOM .  
  How can a top-50 coin, worth over 1.5b usd go to zero in minutes?

Artificial liquidity made the market look vibrant — fake depth lured users into an illusion.  
  But once the matching engine faltered, this fake liquidity collapsed into vacuum



**5、 Comparison with Fair, Regulated Markets**

Are Binance's market makers actually Binance itself? Does Binance still control a market maker like Sigma Chain—as the SEC once alleged? Was the buy order withdrawal purely a system malfunction or intentional by Binance? I cannot verify this.

But regardless, market making should follow basic rules.

In traditional markets like NASDAQ, market maker regulations are extremely strict. Take Rules 4613 and 4619 as examples:

* Market makers must continuously provide two-sided quotes
* Quote depth and spread (Maximum Allowable Spread) have clear limits
* If withdrawing due to technical or legal reasons, must apply for ""Excused Withdrawal""
* Unexcused Withdrawal results in penalties or delisting

Wash Trading is strictly prohibited, with clear role separation between market makers and exchanges. Under such reasonable and fair frameworks, a ""sudden buy-side vacuum"" without major news or concentrated selling pressure is virtually impossible.

Because a stable closed loop forms between the exchange, users, and market makers.

In Binance's regulatory vacuum, the situation is completely opposite: Frequent API errors, severely imbalanced order books, and it's unknown whether user funds are being misappropriated to manipulate market prices. There's extreme incentive misalignment between the outsourced teams maintaining the trading system and the exchange. Do they have sufficient motivation to ensure smooth operation of a system generating $70 million in matching fees daily?



**6、 The Universe's #1 Exchange in a Regulatory Vacuum**

In this incident:

* Long position holders were liquidated
* Short position holders (e.g., ""delta neutral"" strategies—buying spot, selling futures) were forcibly auto-deleveraged (ADL) at absurd prices and liquidated at completely unreasonable prices—exactly as Wintermute's CEO described.

They weren't blind gamblers, yet became sacrifices for Binance's hundred-billion-dollar valuation.

In a market with virtually no regulatory constraints, when an exchange permits such buy-side vacuums, it's no longer intermediating between buyers and sellers—it's directly counter-trading with users. And users always lose.

1p04lf3,The Cycle Of Fear,"This being my second cycle (I ""discovered"" crypto in January 2021), I'm confused by the sentiment of fear surrounding a predictable cycle correction. There are so many clichés with crypto, that ring true: ""Time in market, beats timing the market"", ""Don't catch falling knives"", ""DCA in,  DCA out"", ""Don't invest more than your willing to lose"" and the list goes on. This cycle is acting very similar to the last one, and even had the implied missing ALT season, if you were lucky (good) enough to catch the right ones. As any asset matures, the peaks and valleys become less pronounced.

Historically Bitcoin peaks 13 - 18 months post halving. That's been the case for the past 3 cycles. Meaning, if halving was April 2024 (it was), then the cycle top should be anywhere between May and October 2025.

Of course, to throw in another cliché, no one knows shit about fuck. But if there's one thing that I learned from the first cycle, take your profits and don't get caught holding the bag. Unless you're planning to long term hodl, in which case corrections are irrelevant. I spent the previous bear market, researching, watching charts, learning and accumulating. The bull is fun, but the bear is where you make money.

I plan on buying bitcoin and altcoin, 30 euro per week, for the next 4 years.

For storing bitcoin I found a useful tutorial.

But my question is…. I want to store my altcoin on one or several wallets which I want to keep on a usb stick.
Which wallet is the most user friendly but still safe? I’m looking at exodus wallet. It’s important I need a wallet that doesn’t require KYC.

Is there a tutorial for this kinda thing? For now I’m investing in dogecoin, litecoin, NEAR. Later ethereum, some BNB, Tron.

1ozpb7j,Everyone thinks the next bear will be soft. Reality check: 2026 is shaping up to be the MOST brutal crypto collapse ever.,"All the noise from people keep saying that the next bear market will be a cute little dip. That we would go into ""stocks like environment"" where we see smaller dips, but also smaller gains in coming bulls.

Nope.

2026 is shaping up to be the most violent unwinding this space has ever experienced, and almost nobody is ready for it, as the general consensus from retail is the opposite atm.

Let me explain why.  


**1. Institutions don’t hodl. They sell. And HARD they will sell.**

This cycle was the first time Bitcoin became a truly real institutional asset. Sounds bullish on paper, but the reality no one wants to talk about: institutions are forced sellers during recessions.

They de risk into cash.

They have clients to protect, redemptions to satisfy and risk rules to follow.

They are not your diamond handed Twitter influencers or average crypto bro from Reddit.

When liquidity dries up, they don’t wait for hopium. They hit the sell button.  


**2. The MicroStrategy situation is a ticking bomb. BOMB**. **The ""Tsar bomba"" kind of a bomb.**

Everyone treats MSTR like some “savior of Bitcoin”, but it is basically a publicly traded giga leveraged long BTC position. They have billions in debt and BTC as collateral. If BTC drops -40 to -50%, which it likely will, they get squeezed harder than crypto  gif memes.

If MSTR starts getting margin pressure or forced collateral adjustments, then the selling pressure will be worse than 3AC, Celsius and Terra combined. We will se a huge black swan event, similar or wose than the FTX event. However, this can be magnificant for retail to entry at low prices.   


**3. ETF flows do not just go up.**

Yes. We had the first ETF driven bull run ever. But know what? That will follow with the first ETF driven bear run. If there is a recession or just a risk off macro period, ETF outflows will be brutal. Financial advisors will rotate clients into safer assets. Pension funds will reduce risk exposure. Family offices will trim BTC like any other volatile asset. When the lights go off for good (already starting), ETF outflows mean instant sell pressure that retail is not ready for.  


**4. Corporate treasuries might have to dump too.**

Companies holding BTC look cool in a bull run, but when earnings weaken and credit conditions tighten.. Yeah, time to buckle up and say cya. It's natural for boards to tell them to cut risk. Auditors push impairment accounting. Cash becomes the thing again. Corporate selling has not been tested in a real macro downturn. 2026 WILL LIKELY be the first time.  


**5. Leverage in this market is insane compared to previous cycles.**

The amount of perpetuals, options, structured BTC notes and corporate debt collateralized by BTC is ridiculous. When all of that unwinds under macro stress, it won’t be a small minus -30% dip. It will be a face melting liquidity vacuum.  


**6. QE will not save you early. It arrives after the pain.**

Last but not least. Most people embrace the hopium of QE starting in 2026. Yes. Probably and actually, likely. But only after the market collapses. Q1-Q2 will be brutal. It will be enough time for the charts to plummet so hard it will go beneath your screen's bottom corner. Yes, after that will likely come QE, but why hold through that when one can sell now and double their position soon?

The next crash will not be (only) a retail emotional panic.

It will be an institutional, corporate, leverage driven purge.



BTC survives. ETH probably survives. SOL might survive but bleed badly. Most altcoins will die and never come back. Many of the TOP 20 and even TOP 50 alts are already down -60% to -80% of their ATH prices. ADA going $0,02 or ALGO below $0,5 or ETH below $1000 are not unlikely scenarios. Some will drop even a lot more. Many big alts will be f\*\*d up so hard even their mother will not recognitze them.

So what I'm kinda trying to say.. If you think 2022 was bad, 2026 is going to surprise you.

Not financial advice, btw.

1oyxvxv,I learned the hard way that “it’s all on Ethereum so I’ll sort taxes later” is pure cope.,"Last cycle I did almost everything on ETH… Uniswap, random DeFi farms, a few NFT mints, bridging in and out of L2s. I barely withdrew to my bank, so when tax season came I just reported the clean Coinbase stuff and pretended the on chain mess didn’t exist.

Months later I get a letter basically saying they think I moved way more money than I told them and I need to explain. They had exchange volume and third party reports, and suddenly every flip from ETH to USDC and back looked like income until I could prove what was actually trading and what was just moving funds.

Now I’ve spent weekends living inside Etherscan and old wallets, trying to rebuild cost basis for trades I barely remember, just to show I wasn’t some profit god, I was mostly spinning my wheels and paying gas. I eventually dumped all my wallets and CEX data into a crypto tax tool (Awaken in my case) just to get a halfway decent starting point and then manually cleaned up whatever it mis-tagged.
