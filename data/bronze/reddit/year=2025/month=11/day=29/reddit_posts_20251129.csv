we all thought Bullmarket in 2025 will be awesome and we all knew we will get rich or at least make some good Money. So the Sentiment was from the beginning bullish af and it was a Sure thing right?

The Market showed US one time more that we are fools. Just a bunch of Crypto Bros. The Market-Maker will get us every time. And i promise you next time they will get us too. The Market isnt that complicated on the technical Side. The real value sits in our Emotions and in our assumptions.

Let that think in...

I dont think so. Bitcoin will drop a bit more in my opinion but everyone ist bearish right now.

1payslv,14 Polymarket trading strategies.,"While everything is dumping, Im glad I started playing with prediction markets. At least I can still gamble my crypto port, but it doesn't depend on bitcoin crashing or whatever extreme fear sentiment the market is in. It’s actually great for hedging and 'rotation' (if you believe in that).

I track a lot of Polymarket wallets, and these three have become my favorites to follow because they place diverse, high-conviction bets across everything - politics, sports, pop culture. Even crypto like ""will btc touch $130k in 2025"":

They’re available to the average Joe - you don’t need to be a member of congress or have a nyc real-estate dad who bankrupted himself six times.

# 1. Nothing Ever Happens - Fade the Chaos

Most geopolitical headlines create emotional spikes, but 90% of them resolve into nothing. When YES jumps 10-20% on hype, pros immediately buy NO because fundamentals never changed.

# 2. Copy Trading Profitable Whales

Some wallets have stable, long term alpha from arbitrage, data feeds, or structured models. Instead of competing, track them and mirror only their strongest convictions with 1-2% allocation. You can discover manually on pm -> more -> leaderboard or use 3rd party tools. I’ll post the video in the comments where I go into more detail about these strategies and how to find and track insiders.

# 3. News Scalping

Prediction markets aren't as fast as crypto or equities. HFT isn't as popular. When major news breaks: ceasefires, scandals, Fed leaks - the first 30 sec decide the trade. You buy immediately with momentum, then unload into the slower retail crowd minutes later.

# 4. Personality-Driven Mention Trading

These are a separate category called “mention markets,” common in political speeches and corp earnings calls.  
Speakers have predictable behavior patterns - Trump rambles and repeats, while others stick to teleprompters and avoid going off-script. You bet YES when the speaker is a talker; you bet NO when they’re scripted.

Will Trump mention “rigged elections,” “worst president,” “horrible,” “tremendous”?  
These markets show up almost daily because Donnie from Queens loves to yap. Buy around $0.80 when the market opens, sell around $0.90 when the cameras start rolling.

# 5. Fed Signal Trading

The Fed telegraphs everything before it happens. Following Powell, Waller, Williams, Jefferson, and Timiraos lets you front-run interest rate odds before markets reprice.  
Compare with CME fed watch tool.

# 6. Positive EV Grinding

Some outcomes are 90-95% likely, but retail misprices them at 70-80% because they chase underdog fantasies. Everyone wants that 10x but its very rare in prediction markets. Pros buy the obvious outcome and let it drift back to fair value.

# 7. Break Media Narratives. Trade Reality

Western media often misreports or pushes narratives. Using local language sources, Telegram channels, and verified battlefield or political data gives you earlier and more accurate probabilities than the global crowd.

# 8. ""Girlfriend Poll"" Alpha

Pop culture markets (Taylor Swift albums, influencer drama) are mispriced by male traders. Polling women who follow this world daily gives a surprisingly accurate read.

# 9. Mentions Markets - Default to NO

YES is structurally overpriced in short-duration “mention” markets. Unless the speaker is historically chatty or the narrative strongly fits, NO is almost always the correct baseline.  
Even though Trump is a yapper, but he doesn't mention ""crypto"" often. But everyone in crypto believes believes he does.

# 10. Main-Character Rotation

Politics is attention-driven. Identify who is about to become the “main character” of the news cycle and buy early when they are still cheap.  
For example, everyone assumes Newsom is the next Democratic nominee - but there are still 2 full years before the 2028 election. Plenty of time for him to do something off-putting that could tank his chances.

# 11. Riskless Rate Discounting

""Will US admits aliens exist?"" trades at 2-3%. Why?  
Multi-year markets have a built-in time-value distortion: NO-capital gets locked, holders sell early, and YES briefly becomes overpriced. That 2-3% is ""riskless rate"" and is present in every long duration market. You use that “aliens/Jesus” benchmark to adjust probabilities and place staggered NO orders.

# 12. Fake News Pattern Recognition

Prediction markets get flooded with fake filings, edited screenshots, and fabricated scandals - and retail traders jump instantly. Professionals track patterns from past hoaxes, so when a new “breaking update” appears, they check if it follows the same script. If the source looks sketchy or recycled, they fade the spike. The edge comes from spotting gullibility faster than the crowd.

# 13. Partial Resolution Advocacy

Some markets don’t fail on the event - they fail on the wording. Ambiguous terms like “suit,” “invade,” or “announce” trigger rule fights, leading to partial payouts. If you buy early at 20–40 cents anticipating confusion, you can profit even when the outcome isn’t clean. You’re not predicting reality, you’re predicting how the committee interprets vague language.

# 14. Cultural Calendar Alpha

Governments avoid embarrassing news or risky actions close to major cultural holidays, yet markets still price dramatic moves during these periods. When traders expect something big near a national or pride-heavy date, fading the hype gives you edge. Most people ignore cultural patterns, even though they strongly shape political behavior.

1pay5d0,Why is the crypto market as a whole just so darn predictable?,"So the post I made earlier - kind of held. No bulls are buying. Supposedly JP put another hit piece out on MSTR and that's the supposed reason for the selloff...

  
But it's really not. This could have been seen coming a million miles away, honestly. All these hit pieces. And chances are MSTR will probably fail and force sell some Bitcoin dumping prices further. If they have not already due to the MCSI 55% rule.

  
So that leads to this - why is this so goshdarn predictable? 

  
I've only been swinging it for about 5 years now. But it's easy to see the phases. The best advice is you HAVE to pay attention to vibes on social media, but ALWAYS DO THE OPPOSITE.

  
The halving cycle in many ways predicts if not outright causes the news cycle. Last time around, Bitcoin's natural decay after the peak FOMO part of the pattern in many ways lead to and caused FTX, but FTX was a byproduct. It could have been easily predicted. Every halving cycle, several exchanges or entities involved in Bitcoin go bankrupt because they don't have the liquidity and/or are so zealious and overconfident that they had the liquidity but then overleveraged. Similar to how MSTR is probably right now. They got too --- cocky.

  
Last cycle, Cathy Woods and CNBC and various other media sources right near the final top in the FOMO pattern were calling for 50% returns from that point. That was a clear sign of - exuberance. At the bottom, nobody wanted it, because they thought it would go to $0. And not just Peter Schiff. A ton of reputable sources thought Bitcoin was failing and done when it hit $19k post-FTX.

  
So enter this year. I shorted at 118k, in my Roth IRA via BITI. I then doubled down around 105k via SBIT. That's working out for me pretty well right now. 

  
Cyclically speaking, the FUD follows due to - not just your average Joe - but the big entities folding. You can blame JP Morgan for this all you want, but in the end maybe they are sort of helping to move the halving cycle along, but the halving cycle was already set in motion well before JP Morgan started talking FUD on Microstrategy. It really doesn't matter what Microstrategy does at this point - it's just that part of the cycle. Bitcoin is going to continue falling until people stop saying ""It's going to 105k. It's going to $1 million. Q4 will be epic. Blah blah blah blah blah blah....""

  
Don't fight the FUD. Embrace it until it turns into true, undeniable fear. Then buy it.

  
The only thing that could break the halving cycle is if Trump starts buying Bitcoin and establishing a strategic reserve. Maybe. But I'm not sure that's as bullish as people think - if Trump ends up controlling the Federal Reserve with his agenda and establishes the Bitcoin Reserve - it could actually be quite bearish and may actually cause this to be Bitcoin's Proof of Steak moment to where the next halving cycle high is lower than the current cycle because people are realizing the whole project lost it's mission.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pay5d0/why_is_the_crypto_market_as_a_whole_just_so_darn/,f00dl3,0,24,0.35,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764548625.0,2025-12-01T00:23:45
1pav24p,Are bitcoin whales actually hesitating right now or just playing it smart? the data looks weird,"Recent analysis from Joao Wedson is showing something a bit uncomfortable – wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have pretty much stopped adding. That band usually lines up with funds, desks and more “professional” money. Historically when these guys stop pressing the buy button for a while it hasn’t been a great vibe for price later.

The spooky part is it looks a lot like 2021. Back then the same wallet range cooled off on accumulation and a few months later we slid into a proper bear market. Not saying copy paste crash incoming but it’s one of those signals you don’t just ignore.

But there’s a twist here. After that December nuke where institutions dumped around 79,000 BTC and we got hit with roughly a 15% correction, some of the bigger players actually started buying back in. Over the last 30 days or so they’ve scooped up something like 34,000 BTC again which means at least some whales think these levels are decent entry or reload zones.

So on one side you’ve got those mid sized 100–1,000 BTC wallets acting cautious and on the other side you’ve got larger institutional guys quietly stacking the dip. The pause from the mid tier whales feels like weaker medium term demand but the bigger wallets stepping in should add some kind of floor underneath.

The annoying part is retail is still basically asleep. Most of this is just big wallets and structured money slapping each other around so price action feels less like a classic cycle and more like a liquidity game.

Are whales positioning for something big or just managing risk after a crazy run up hard to say for sure but these mixed signals are definitely worth keeping an eye on",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pav24p/are_bitcoin_whales_actually_hesitating_right_now/,hodorrny,34,33,0.74,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764540647.0,2025-11-30T22:10:47
1pau89j,Strategy’s 48 billion usd bitcoin bet and the one time they’d actually sell,"strategy’s CEO just laid out the only scenario where they’d *actually* sell some of their bitcoin and it’s kinda wild

phong le basically said they’d only even think about selling as a total last resort if two things happen **together**  
1 their stock trades below the value of their bitcoin stack (mNAV drops under 1x)  
2 they cant raise any new capital anymore equity debt preferreds nothing

their whole model is built around the opposite situation when strategy trades at a premium they issue more shares or preferreds raise cash and use that to buy more bitcoin so each share ends up backed by more btc over time that’s what they keep calling “bitcoin yield per share”

le also admitted that with something like 700 to 800 million dollars a year in preferred dividends and other payments to make if that equity premium disappears for long enough selling a bit of the stack can actually be the “mathematically right” move to protect existing holders and keep that btc yield per share story alive not some “we lost faith in bitcoin” moment just pure balance sheet math

right now strategy holds almost 650k btc which is insane that’s about 48 billion usd of cost basis at roughly 74k per coin and close to 60 billion at recent prices so they’re literally the biggest corporate bitcoin holder on the planet

to calm everyone down after the latest dump they rolled out this new btc credit or “credit dashboard” where they show how their debt and preferreds are covered at different bitcoin prices according to their own numbers they still have about 5.9x btc assets to convertible debt if btc just sits around their \~74k average cost basis and even in a nasty 25k scenario they say it’s still about 2x coverage plus they keep bragging about a 70 plus year dividend runway at current prices

their view on bitcoin itself hasnt really changed they’re still in the “scarce non sovereign asset that people everywhere reach for when their local money sucks” camp think us plus places like argentina or turkey where inflation is brutal

the whole thing is kinda crazy because most bitcoin maxis love to say “we’ll never sell” but here you’ve got a listed company with almost a 60 billion usd position openly spelling out the one situation where selling some coins is on the table i kinda respect that they at least admit there is a worst case playbook instead of pretending bitcoin magically removes the need for risk management feels very “grown up bitcoiner” energy tbh same kind of risk math vibe you see from nerdy tax and balance sheet people building stuff like awaken tax and koinly",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1pau89j/strategys_48_billion_usd_bitcoin_bet_and_the_one/,Gullible-Tale9114,88,46,0.86,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764538600.0,2025-11-30T21:36:40

1paox12,"Opinion: Hard Forks are necessary for eliminating technical debt, reducing excessive complexity, and keeping blockchains secure from outdated and insecure protocols","####**What is a Hard Fork?**

Hard forks are common for blockchains. Most newer and modern blockchains use a mix of soft and hard forks for updates. Older blockchains often soft fork to maintain backwards compatibility with old and insecure client versions.

By definition, a hard fork is an update or event that will result in a chain split if block producers and node clients continue using different versions.

####**Soft Forks result in code bloat, dangerous practices, and technical debt**:

Soft forks maintain backwards compatibility with older clients, so they need to add additional code logic to detect and deal with all the different types of clients they might encounter. This creates developer complexity and code bloat by continuously supporting archaic and dangerous practices.

**Imagine what would happen without hard-forks**:

* Newer WiFi routers would still support the insecure WEP or WPA protocol
* Browser would still support old, insecure versions of SSL
* Newer computers would still support Windows 3.0 (launched 1990) natively
* Windows 11 would still support early 1990s Intel 386-generation hardware.
* All city roads would still allow for horses and wagons.
* All US stores would still accept 3-cent, 5-cent and 10-cent paper notes; and half-cent, 2-cent, and 3-cent, and large cents; and $100,000 bills.
* Doctors would still support dangerous practices such as bloodletting, mercury prescriptions, arsenic prescriptions, and trepanning (drilling holes into skulls)

It's dangerous to never hard fork.

####**Bitcoin soft forks results in complexity and update delays**

Bitcoin still supports many outdated legacy addresses such as P2PK, P2MS, P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKSH, P2WSH. Each of these has their own special quirks, and every Bitcoin client needs to add additional complexity to support them. Many of these aren't quantum secure and should be prevented from transferring in the future, which requires a hard fork.

Bitcoin nodes also take forever to update to a new version. It wasn't until mid-2024 that most clients supported transferring to Bech32m addresses that were introduced in May 2021. Taproot, which requires Bech32m support, also took nearly half a decade to obtain significant client support. That's because unlike with hard forks, Bitcoin nodes aren't required to support the latest features. So it takes the Bitcoin network half a decade to pick up new features.

####**Bitcoin has hard-forked at least twice, and that's perfectly fine**

Lastly, contrary to popular opinion, Bitcoin's canonical chain has actually hard forked at least twice unintentionally.

1. There was a temporary 0.8 update related to the 2013 reorg (where a 51% attack and double-spend also occurred). Had the update been planned as a hard fork instead of soft fork, there wouldn't have been a disastrous chain split.
2. The 0.3.6 OP_NOP update also resulted in a hard fork a year later when the first OP_NOPX transaction was submitted in block 163685.

Pre-0.3.6 Bitcoin clients no longer sync with newer versions due to a hard fork, and that's not a bad thing. No one should be running archaic versions of Bitcoin client.

Jameson Lopp discovered that 7 out of 21 known Bitcoin consensus updates were of the hard fork type and not the soft fork type. They could've been triggered by a ""poisoned"" transaction like in the November 2025 Cardano chain split, but no one ever submitted one for 5 of them. These include Bitcoin 0.2's best chain selection logic, Bitcoin OP_VER update prior to 0.3.6, the scriptSig bug patched in v0.3.7, the critical inflation bug patched in v0.15.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1paox12/opinion_hard_forks_are_necessary_for_eliminating/,HSuke,2,21,0.56,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin OR ethereum,reddit_post,1764525883.0,2025-11-30T18:04:43

>Strategy would consider selling Bitcoin only if its stock falls below net asset value and the company loses access to fresh capital, CEO Phong Le said in a recent interview.
