The increase may disrupt the yen carry trade, a strategy that has historically provided liquidity for investments like Bitcoin and tech stocks. As liquidity tightens, Bitcoin's recent gains and broader risk assets could face challenges. Investors are urged to adapt strategies, monitor market trends, and diversify portfolios to navigate the anticipated volatility and shifting monetary landscape.

nsj3prp,1pfdktm,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Bitcoin thieves in Malaysia have stolen $1.1 billion worth of electricity for illegal mining operations, using tactics like fake bird noises to mask the sound of mining rigs. Authorities have identified over 13,000 illicit sites since 2020 and are employing drones, thermal imaging, and handheld sensors to detect unauthorized power usage. The crackdown aims to protect Malaysia's energy infrastructure, which is critical for its green transition and economic growth. The government is considering stricter measures, including a potential ban on Bitcoin mining.

Analysts expect Bitcoin's underperformance to be temporary, with recovery likely as global liquidity and equity markets improve.

The transaction aligns with previous patterns involving Coinbase Prime custody services, though the exact destination remains unverified. SpaceX still holds around 5,012 BTC, valued at $457.8 million. The company has not disclosed its Bitcoin strategy or the purpose of this transfer, which follows a trend of large Bitcoin movements by SpaceX in recent months.

nsekyfv,1pers07,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Bitcoin's price remains under a month-long downtrend, struggling to break above $95,000, which is critical for regaining bullish momentum. Exchange balances have dropped significantly, with over 23,385 BTC withdrawn, reducing sell pressure and signaling long-term holding behavior. Smaller wallets are accumulating aggressively, while larger holders are cautious. Institutional participation is lacking, which could hinder Bitcoin's recovery. A breakout above $95,000 could lead to a rally, but failure to sustain support may push prices lower.

ns81rwf,1pdp965,Then-Veterinarian-41,"Here's what btc being adopted by the financial markets means (warning: AI slop)

With the approval and explosive growth of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024–2025, Bitcoin has effectively become a “stock-like” asset in the eyes of traditional finance. This integration into regulated equity markets has quietly opened the door to the same abusive short-selling tactics that have plagued equities for decades—most notably, naked shorting.

Here’s how it works now:

Rehypothecation of ETF shares and underlying Bitcoin
Authorized Participants (APs) such as Jane Street, Flow Traders, or large banks can create new ETF shares by delivering Bitcoin (or cash that is immediately used to buy Bitcoin) to the issuer (BlackRock, Fidelity, etc.). Once created, those ETF shares enter the broader securities lending ecosystem. Prime brokers borrow these ETF shares, lend them out, and the borrowers can sell them short.

Failure-to-deliver loops become invisible
In traditional equities, naked shorting is technically limited by Reg SHO and the requirement to locate borrowable shares. But because Bitcoin ETFs settle T+1 (and sometimes effectively T+0 via creation/redemption in-kind), failures-to-deliver (FTDs) in the ETF shares can be masked almost indefinitely through the creation/redemption mechanism. An AP can “create” new shares to cover a short position without ever forcing the short seller to buy Bitcoin on the open market, creating what is effectively a synthetic long that dilutes the real supply.

Custodian-level rehypothecation
The actual Bitcoin held by the ETF custodians (Coinbase Custody for most major funds) can itself be rehypothecated in ways that are opaque to investors. Coinbase and other custodians offer prime brokerage and lending services. A custodian can lend out the same Bitcoin collateral multiple times across different silos (ETF holdings, margin lending, derivatives collateral, etc.), creating fractional-reserve exposure far in excess of actual coins held.

Paper Bitcoin via derivatives layering
Large institutions can now sell short the ETF while simultaneously selling futures, options, or structured products that reference the ETF. Because the CFTC and SEC have jurisdiction over different pieces, no single regulator sees the full net short interest. The CME Bitcoin futures market already routinely trades 5–10× the real deliverable supply; layering ETF short interest on top amplifies this further.

No meaningful buy-in requirement
Unlike physical gold ETFs (which eventually face delivery pressure when shorts get too large), Bitcoin has no industrial demand floor and no central bank reserve requirement. Shorts can remain open for years as long as the creation/redemption arbitrage keeps the ETF price tracking the Bitcoin index price. The only thing that forces covering is a sustained, sharp price increase that makes the borrow cost (already 1–5% annualized via securities lending) prohibitive—or a run on redemptions that custodians can’t meet with real coins.

In essence, the arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs has transformed Bitcoin from a purely bearer asset with a strictly capped 21 million supply into something that behaves, in the regulated financial system, like any other heavily rehypothecated security. The “stock” (the ETF share) can now be naked shorted in unlimited quantity as long as the creation/redemption machinery keeps turning and custodians are willing to accept ever-increasing counterparty risk on their balance sheets.

The hard 21 million coin limit still exists on-chain, but in the paper markets that now dominate price discovery, Bitcoin has become dilutable—just like the U.S. dollar after 1971. The only difference is that the dilution happens through Wall Street’s traditional tools (ETF share creation, securities lending, and custodian rehypothecation) rather than a central bank printing press.",4,t3_1pdp965,1764842934.0,2025-12-04T10:08:54,CryptoCurrency,bitcoin,reddit_comment

>Ark is coming online to offer more options and liquidity on layer 2. 

They all have the same problem: You need at least one onchain transaction and BTC is so massively crippled that this will not work at scale. Instead custodial solutions are rolled out providing nothing of the freedom and control an uncrippled Bitcoin would.


>This is all very predictable.

It is but in the complete opposite sense you mean it. BTC/LN is shoehorned back into custodial use so that banks and state can keep control if they decide to use BTC.

>Edit: also just to be clear, there is a mantra many actual bitcoiners use these days in place of hodl… it’s “spend and replace”.

The only 'real' Bitcoin L2 (as in a layer that is actually secured by the L1) is Lightning, and that has been reducing in capacity over time... the amount of Bitcoin that was using Lightning dropped by about 30% between August 2024 and August 2025:

It seems intentionally midleading to use a phrase like ""continue to expand"" when it is doing the opposite...


There are of course other chains that claim to be 'L2s' and often use phrases that sound plausible like 'ZK rollup'... but as far as I can tell all of these are just variations of sidechains/commit chains... not actually using Bitcoin L1's security but instead they are just completely seperate networks that post commits to Bitcoin, presumably to trick non-technical Bitcoin maxis into supporting them!

Nothing about that chart looks “dead” and anyone that spends any time in the bitcoin space would realize how silly the claim sounds. It is broadly used as the daily transaction medium by folks who are sending bitcoin. Obviously the key question there is whether more folks will spend bitcoin. That’s unlikely in most developed countries due to unfavorable tax treatment. 

Ark is coming as an alternate type of L2 that will have strengths and weaknesses different from lightning - I believe it is already in public beta on mainchain. More layer 2 protocols will likely exist in the future. Overall, capacity will continue to increase though I’m sure there will be drawdowns depending on timing and unit of measure as with any chart.

I never used the term ""dead"" either... it is really disconcerting trying to have a discussion when in every reply you falsely quote me!


Also I used to run a Lightning node way back when that was the only way to use LN and first span up a Bitcoin full node back in 2015... so I'd like to think I count as someone who has spent some time in the bitcoin space.


Going back to Lightning's capacity, Memepool is showing there are currently just 3,747 BTC in Lightning channels [https://mempool.space/lightning] but even if we take the value from your chart of 5,378, that is not very impressive. There is more Bitcoin wrapped on some Ethereum L2s than on Lightning - e.g. 8,092 on Arbitrum [https://arbiscan.io/token/0x2f2a2543b76a4166549f7aab2e75bef0aefc5b0f].


Regarding Ark, firstly from that page you shared they agree with my point previously about only Lightning counting as a real L2 for Bitcoin:


> Lightning is currently the only true layer 2 on the bitcoin network.

[https://ark-protocol.org/#comparing-ark-with-the-lightning-network]


Secondly, Ark doesn't really sound like a proper L2 either, nothing seems to be secured by Bitcoin but instead is all just controlled by a centralized server:


> *Ark, on the other hand, is a client-server protocol, with users coordinating their payments via a central server*


Again, from the page you shared:


> *Ark’s transaction trees are created in rounds. The Ark server organizes these rounds periodically, giving users the opportunity to forfeit old VTXOs for new ones—known as a refresh or batch. During a round, any user with a VTXO can participate and request the Ark server to include a refresh for them. The Ark server then constructs a new shared UTXO containing all refreshes from that round.*

ns5kbme,1pdjobo,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF suite has become the firm's most profitable product line, driven by the launch of its US spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) in January 2024 and subsequent global expansions, including Australia and Brazil. IBIT quickly amassed $70 billion in assets and generated $245 million in annual fees by October 2024. With allocations nearing $100 billion, BlackRock now holds over 3% of all Bitcoin in circulation. The ETFs are popular for their accessibility, liquidity, and use as portfolio diversifiers despite Bitcoin's volatility.

ns5ezht,1pdiyfo,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; BlackRock CEO Larry Fink discussed his evolving stance on Bitcoin, shifting from associating it with illicit activities to embracing it as an asset class. Speaking at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit, Fink referred to Bitcoin as an 'asset of fear,' influenced by global events like the US-China trade deal and the Ukraine war. BlackRock has since launched a spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, which reached a peak value of $70 billion. This marks a significant change from Fink's earlier critical views on cryptocurrency.

ns4uw99,1pdggo2,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Bitcoin experienced its strongest trading day since May, gaining 5.81% on Tuesday and forming a bullish engulfing pattern. This marks a potential structural shift in the market, with traders eyeing a rally toward $107,000. A daily close above $96,000 is critical for confirming a bullish trend. The rally was supported by strong buy-side trading and increased institutional demand, as indicated by the Coinbase Premium Index turning positive. High-volume breakouts and improved global liquidity suggest a possible sustained recovery for Bitcoin.

ns16vnb,1pcydc2,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Glassnode's report highlights Bitcoin's resilience amidst market challenges, noting a $732 billion capital inflow since 2022 and a realized market value of $1.1 trillion. Despite a recent 20% decline, Bitcoin remains near annual highs, with reduced volatility attributed to institutional participation and ETFs. The report suggests the downturn is a mid-cycle correction rather than a new 'crypto winter,' supported by strong mining sector performance and long-term investor retention. Historical patterns indicate potential for recovery.

The company also added 130 Bitcoins, increasing its total holdings to 650,000 BTC. This reserve, funded by selling Class A common stock, aims to provide liquidity and reassure stakeholders amidst market fluctuations. Strategy's dual approach of maintaining a cash reserve and expanding its Bitcoin portfolio highlights its commitment to balancing traditional finance with cryptocurrency investments for long-term growth.

He always buy the top because his stock is overvalued and he dilutes shareholder to buy bitcoins. And he cant load up at bottoms  because the stock cannot be diluted as easily and he needs to fix solvency issues, exacerbated by his new dividends shares.

He buys 1 bil of btc when btc is 126k, and he stacks cash when btc is 40% down from ath. The more btc falls the more he has to hoard cash, and viceversa. And he always has to make it bigger to keep scaling, so the more btc rises the more he buys, raising his median price. He started buying in what, 2020? he's just 10% up overall.

This decision, driven by persistent demand, opens access to over 50 million brokerage customers. While Vanguard won't create its own crypto products, it will support regulated crypto ETFs and mutual funds, excluding those tied to memecoins. This marks a significant shift in traditional finance's approach to digital assets.

nru91un,1pc057x,coinfeeds-bot,"tldr; Bitcoin's potential rise to $96,900 could trigger the liquidation of approximately $9.6 billion in short positions, as per current data. Short liquidations occur when leveraged bets against Bitcoin are force-closed due to unmet margin requirements. A sharp price increase could lead to a short squeeze, where additional buying pressure from short sellers covering their positions drives prices higher, causing further liquidations. Bitcoin's recent volatility has been influenced by increased leveraged trading in derivatives markets.

Analysts suggest this week is pivotal for Bitcoin's 2025 performance, with the market's ability to defend prior lows being critical. Despite bearish sentiment, some traders view the current price levels as an opportunity to buy. The article emphasizes the importance of conducting personal research before making investment decisions.
