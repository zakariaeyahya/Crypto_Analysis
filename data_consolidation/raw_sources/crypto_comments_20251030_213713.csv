1. Yes, you're right to be concerned. Dumping all of your money into one investment that you know nothing about is pretty much the worst idea in the world.
2. I would check to see if they even own the XRP at all. There's a good change they don't. There are scam ""exchanges"" and ""brokerages"" all over the damn place who take your money, pretend that you own the crypto, will even give you statements showing how awesome it's doing, when in reality all they did was take your money for themselves, and you never actually had any crypto. You go to sell it and, after getting the runaround for a while, eventually you learn that it never existed at all, they just took your money and ran.
3. Crypto is a stupid thing to use for a long-term hands-off investment vehicle. It's volatile AF and the overwhelming majority of the crypto products that have ever existed are worth less (and often *worthless*) after 10 years.
4. XRP has a long history of doing nothing. Sure, it's had 2 or 3 good spikes in the last 15 years but most of the time it just sits around stagnant. There's absolutely nothing promising about it, there's no reason to believe it's likely to go up in value over time. Sure, it might, but there's really no solid foundation that points to a likelihood that it will. While it looks like it's doing okay today, you have to keep in mind that's it's still trading below its ATH from 7 years ago and there's a good chance it never really goes up a whole lot from where it is today.
5. When you're trying to build long-term generational wealth, you really can't beat the traditional securities. Mutual funds, index funds, etc. That's where smart people put their wealth for long periods of time, because it's safe and it's virtually always high-yield over long periods of time.
6. It's fine to play around with crypto a bit, it's fine to make it a small part of your investment strategy, but it's an idiotic gambler mentality to make it your sole investment plan.
7. Generally speaking, you don't make money buying the peak. There's a good chance that XRP is seriously overvalued right now. They YOLO'd your inheritance into something that's *already* gone up, instead of strategically buying something that's undervalued.

My suggestion: They should sell the XRP now (if they even really have it, and the money didn't just get scammed from them, see point #2), and then open up a stock brokerage account (with a *reputable* brokerage, like Fidelity or Robinhood or something) and just put the funds in an S&P 500 index fund and sit on it.",2,False,,t3_1ok45gy,0

Crypto is not a scam, but it also is a less regulated investment. And it is one where there is a lot of misinformation. It is also very easy to lose your crypto if you don't self custody it properly. And crypto exchanges are not as secure as banks. Even the least likely to fail are less secure than banks. And since even banks can fail, it is dangerous not to self-custody. 

Moreover, XRP is an altcoin. No shade to XRP here as I would say this regardless of altcoin, and XRP is one of the larger altcoins and is not a scam token like many alts. However, altcoins are not how one should start with crypto. Start with bitcoin (BTC) and then move your way to alts once you know what you are doing. BTC is the backbone of crypto. It is also the only crypto, outside of stable coins, that is somewhat stable. 

Talk to your parents and find out what they are doing. Look into crypto yourself if they are putting a lot of money into crypto so you are better positioned to advise them. Try to limit their crypto exposure (even BTC) if it is money they may need in the next 3-5 years. And do your best to limit their altcoin exposure.

My advice to someone 20 is going to be different than to older adults. Retirees should be very careful with crypto investments and especially altcoin investments. A 20 or 30 year old who has the cash flow can afford some risks. A retiree may not be able to. And while I think crypto, especially BTC, is a smart long-term investment.

One being that general sentiment around crypto is definitely down right now, it's not as fresh and promising as it used to seem. It's lagging behind stocks/equities, where crypto used to seem like the place to be for these amazing returns, we're continuing to chop / go down while everything else outperforms - people start questioning whether it's the right asset to be holding when you could've just gone the traditional route with stocks for the most part of this year and been outperforming. Look at how well gold has been performing (this also played into the negative price action).

I also think we're lagging behind in terms of the sort of tech that is developed on the blockchain in terms of AI. Everything is like a beta/worse version of what is already being done. It feels tacky. 

Also yes, I think Trump is largely to blame. The volatility around the market is incredibly tiring, the price action is terrible. We're being thrown all over with this tariff bs. One second it's good, the next it's 100% tariffs. Obviously this is by design, the Trump family is benefitting billions from this from insider trading so it makes sense for them.

Bitcoin is near a structural shifting point at this moment. This shifting point isn‚Äôt macro. It is more about the micro of the four-year cycle belief. 

The reality is, a lot of Bitcoin whales made loads of money from trading the four year cycle over the past. And now they are dumping on the market.

They were right about it so many times before and the hodlers got it wrong. As ppl say, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fix what is not broken‚Äù, they will continue trade like it is a four year cycle until the future data punishes them and tells them it is different otherwise. 

They are dumping billions regularly. Alts are suffering in its consequence. On CT, many traders are hoping this four year thing gets resolved next year. But the market doesn‚Äôt wait and is likely front running it now.
