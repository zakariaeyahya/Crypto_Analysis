1. Binance secretly funnels $2B to WLFI.
2. WLFI then takes that money and buys $2B of treasury bonds and creates $2B of USD1.
3. The Treasury bonds begin earning interest to the tune of $60-80 million a year for WLFI.
4. This original $2B of USD1 is given to a shell company that 'invests' it back into Binance, which sits in Binance's bank account as USD1.
5. As long as Binance does not redeem the USD1 for cash, this will continue to earn money for WLFI.

I ran into one of my old friends who I had previously helped purchase 10 BTC (and I once sold a Casascius coin to back in 2014) earlier this year. He said, ""I wish I would have bought coin back when you told me to!""

When I told him he did buy coin and I helped him do it he shook his head and laughed. 

""Yeah, but I sold all those about a year later after it fell in price."" 

He meant he should have listened to me and bought it again when I mentioned it again on my social media in like 2017. I told him he could still buy Bitcoin today, but he said it's too expensive.

Some people are just not meant to be Bitcoiners. They have a ""victim of circumstance"" demeanor when it comes to their finances. They follow trends, never set them. They talk about things they see on the news, and never seek knowledge from the original sources. They have next to no understanding of value, nor do they have the saving mindset. I don't think they even possess the capability to change into a saver's mindset, either.

There's an old adage that you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. I used to think the adage was just a cute saying, maybe something relating to people who are good at something not realizing they have a knack for it. I realized that day what it really meant...

It means that most of what we teach each other is ignored. Very few people actually seek out knowledge or have a desire to learn more and more, as much as they can about the world and their place in it. Or they hear it and for whatever reason they don't process it. 

They'll go visit some new location but they are there for the ""experience"", because they saw a Youtube video or streamer talk about the place, or they heard about a vacation there from a friend, not actually to learn about whatever the tour guide tells them or to actually understand the struggles of the locals or the history.

These are the same people that give you a blank stare when you talk about how you have 15 tabs of Wikipedia open on your browser right now, or their eyes glaze over when you talk about a new technology that you are messing around with and the struggles you are having implementing software changes on the newest hardware. When you start talking about the history of money, they fall asleep.

You can hold the cup of knowledge right against some people's lips, and just like the horse, unless they are actually thirsty, they aren't going to drink it.",12,False,,t3_1oht3fd,0

The same trader had previously been suspected of insider knowledge after profiting from well-timed Bitcoin and Ethereum shorts before Trump's tariff announcement. Speculation arose about insider trading, but some argue the pardon was predictable due to CZ's significant investments. Former BitForex CEO Garrett Jin denied involvement in the trades.

This is the fundamental flaw in the system. The original design involved statesmen - not politicians. You were supposed to serve the country for a term or two and then go home and rejoin the productive citizens with a real job. Re-election matters a great deal less if you're expected to leave office anyway.

Under that model you want to actually solve problems because once you leave office you're going to have to live in the real world under the rules (and solutions) that you built while in service to the people.

But if you never have to actually contribute to (or participate in) society because you spend your entire life as a career politician and thus part of the ""rules for thee and not for me"" crowd you have an active incentive NOT to solve problems in any meaningful way. Problems are what get you re-elected (problems that you create, maintain, and blame on the other side of the same coin.)

Furthermore, you're incentivized not to solve problems that have unpleasant solutions. If the problem is that you're going bankrupt the solution is to cut spending and/or increase revenue. But no one wants to elect the person who cut their favorite social program or who raised taxes. The ""solution"" for a politician is always to kick the can down the road just far enough they can get re-elected and count on the (very reliably) short memory of the public to forget that this person has done that 5 times already come election day.",5,False,,t1_nlxyjcd,2

Meteora, a cryptocurrency protocol, airdropped $4.2 million worth of $MET tokens to three addresses linked to the Trump team just hours after its co-founder, Benjamin Chow, was sued for orchestrating $57 million in pump-and-dump schemes using endorsements from Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei. The airdrop was linked to liquidity provision for the $TRUMP token, and the recipients immediately deposited the tokens into OKX, possibly to cash out. The lawsuit alleges that Chow used celebrity endorsements to manipulate token prices, leading to significant losses for investors. Forensic analysis revealed a central coordinating wallet behind the scheme, which funded deployer wallets and seeded liquidity for multiple tokens, including $MELANIA and $LIBRA, which have since crashed in value.",8,True,,t3_1ofzxfg,0

If you  also have dickcancer and your wife just divorced you and she took the kids, then it's time to feel down.

Build something again, find some online sidehustles, save the money, dont gamble with it.
If you want to do crypto, there's only 1 way (in my opinion), hold bitcoin for minimum 5 years.

So know you aren’t alone. The key is changing your mindset, accept this has happened (once!) regardless of how difficult it is, brush yourself off and continue your journey one step at a time.

Understand this… and I know you have heard it many times… you are truly still early into the crypto world. It’s not taken off into global adoption. Heck it’s still only 20-25% of golds market cap (I think). 

Keep working your job. Find a second part time job you can use that income for specifically crypto. Stick with utility coins that are proven and step by step rebuild.

It’s only money. At any and every level, that comes and goes. It’s not your “end all be all”. 

Nearly everyone in crypto has been scammed (some more than once) and often through no fault of your own! There are horrible nefarious people that prey on stealing from and harming others. But rest assured, they will one day stand in front of the ultimate judge to face their final judgment and penalty for all of eternity.

The extent of the drop is uncertain, but it will undoubtedly be severe and tumultuous. Despite this impending correction, my long-term outlook for the BTC price remains optimistic.

Now, I don't base any of my investments on others predictions or analysis. However, I find it intriguing how every time I read one, there's a new TA Metric I didn't know about, or a new indicator that has the answers. 


In my opinion yes, $8k is very possible, but not sure if it is based on the analysis, but instead historical macro data that could suggest it's the next top. 


But some say $10k, others say we're getting rekt. In the meantime we get insiders trading futures. 


So is the era of TA over? Do we need to rely now on Insiders' positions to get ahead and accept the manipulation?

Although long term market prices are based on fundamentals, short term prices are based on what people are willing to pay.

For the past 2.5 years I’ve been using my “main” job for all my bills, living money, essentials, etc., and my other full time job’s earnings go 100% into Bitcoin. 

I actually started buying in 2019 when it was at $5,000 per coin, but didn’t understand it enough yet. I certainly wasn’t buying enough and not thinking about the future. I was buying it to use on the dark web. Once I began to realize what it really was, it was game on.

I am now 100% a Bitcoin maxi, and I believe this is the escape hatch for people to break out of the unfair financial system we’ve been forced into. I buy the dips. I buy the all time highs. I buy everything in between. I have no number in my head that I need to reach so I can stop buying. I will buy indefinitely until one day down the road, I need it for something.

Analysts project bullish sentiment for Bitcoin, with some forecasting a $200,000 target in Q4. Bitcoin's broader trend remains upward, supported by long-term demand and institutional accumulation.

That’s kind of what paying off high-interest debt gives you from a guaranteed returns perspective, albeit paying a debt down is not exactly the same as throwing every dollar you can get at a guaranteed 30% annual return! Still, it's a risk free gain that’s easy to overlook when there's investment FOMO such as btc.

But all that aside, paying off a $1,000 credit card balance and a 30% guaranteed 'interest saved' return isn't all that significant (you could carry that balance relatively unnoticed for the rest of your life if the balance didn't grow and you had steady income). In hindsight I think the real return to someone in your position in paying off a $1,000 credit card balance is building a mindset that credit card and other similar types of debt isn’t normal.

Search for Jimmy Carr's response to the question ""Why did you have kids"" He said:

> “I had kind of an existential crisis... Yeah, I really wanted [kids]. Here's what I did. Genuinely, man to man, I'll tell you. I thought I was gaming the system by not having kids. I thought I was f**king smart Because I had such an easy life. I thought I was playing the video game of life and I’d found the cheat code. And it was easy, easy, easy. And then I got to my mid-40s and I went: ""Oh, I'm sitting at a bullsh!t, low stakes table and there's a bigger game to be played."" And then I had kids, and every other status game seemed trivial.""

So even though I LOVE Bitcoin, I'd 100% give up fitness or Bitcoin before I voluntarily gave up my family. Providing for my family is one of the main reasons I even care about Bitcoin. I know how to thrive and be completely happy without BTC, and I can totally do it, but I'd prefer to have BTC for countless reasons.

Ah, it's always easy to spot the BCashies who got convinced by Roger Ver and Craig Wright that BCH was going to kill BTC.  They traded their stacks of BTC for BCH at absurd prices.  Even after BCH tanked they were convinced the market would eventually go with low fee BCH as the real Bitcoin, it was only a matter of time.

8+ years later and BCH is -90% from 2017 prices when BTC is $100K and they are still think BCH has any relevancy.  Sorry for your losses.

The longer-term holders (a couple of years) who are in the green give up because they see other assets (stocks/gold) take off and they feel like they've missed the party.  And eventually all of the selling is exhausted, bitcoin becomes boring and basically stays in a stable band (I would say it's somewhere between $80k - $120k right now-ish)  When that's done, bitcoin will take off again.  But at $100k+ bitcoin is pretty stable and a lot of long-term holders with 1,000+ bitcoin are offloading.  It will end eventually. 

These cycles still exist, they are just less obvious than before because the halvings are less significant.

Los grandes no necesitan comprar rápido, necesitan comprar barato y en silencio, y para eso lo mejor es un mercado aburrido donde la gente se rinde.

Además, con las políticas de los bancos centrales cambiando (tasas a la baja, más liquidez, etc.) no sería raro que el despegue llegue cuando el sentimiento esté por los suelos, no cuando la narrativa está en su punto máximo. Bitcoin históricamente premia la paciencia, no la euforia.

Lo único que tengo claro es que, pase cuando pase, el inversor medio sigue sin entender una cosa: tener BTC también significa tener estrategia. Yo en mi caso diversifico en real estate (incluso explorando cripto + inmuebles en Europa), porque si un día el mercado tarda más de lo esperado, prefiero que mi patrimonio no dependa solo de un ciclo.

I launched last week and was already able to predict 2 events.

The biggest one was the OpenAI ChatGPT browser release, where a high impact trade of $27,000 was done the night before the launch at a 62% probability.

The other one was Trump pardoning CZ (Binance founder). This one was harder since the biggest holder for this position had done multiple trades under $10,000. However, I it caught another trader that made a large trade the second the news broke when the odds were at 70%.

For example, Ethereum block production is centralized, but block proposal, block validation, and its finality layer are all done by separate groups of validators. And unlike with PoW, there is extremely strong economic incentive for each layer of security to remain honest, so it's able to remain secure than PoW at a tiny fraction of the cost of PoW.

https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1bslnit/coinbases_base_dex_hits_1_billion_volume/

just a couple of days ago ETH investors who are always extolling the virtues of decentralization were celebrating a centralized megacorp L2


> Ethereum to onboard 1.4B new users as Chinese AliPay megacorp launches own L2 

https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1o80brw/ethereum_to_onboard_14b_new_users_as_chinese/


The irony in all this is that these centralized company L2 sequencers are essentially databases that do batch updates to the main chain while stealing most of the fees from it and ETH investors continue to celebrate them


Ethereum's highest volume L2, Base, has contributed less than $5 million to the mainnet since 2023. $5 Million in fees collected in 2 years with the vast majority of the actual fees kept to themselves.  

Now it's even cheaper with the recent upgrades:

https://tokenterminal.com/explorer/projects/base/financial-statement


I warned ETH Maxis over a year ago and they told me I was ignoring all the *""revenue fundamentals""* and that I should *""get some psychiatric help""*  

Ethereum fee revenue has dropped 48% year over year because of all the upgrades.  You'll also notice TRON has done upgrades to cut fees by 60% in order to compete with Ethereum to keep their share of Stablecoin dominance.  *It will be a race to the bottom.*  GG

> in order to compete with other chains, Ethereum will have to scale and that has seen the rise of L2/sidechains which results in loss  transaction fees and MEV tips essentially stealing value from ETH.  This essentially turns Ethereum, Solana, BSC, Tron, L2/Sidechains, etc into competing networks for DeFi casinos and rails for StablecCoin transfers where they have to remain cheap or utility and users will move to competing chains.

The result is your benchmark or reference point isn’t a representative or “factual” way to understand anything you can invest in.

But did you know in 1922-24 Germany that a loaf of bread was worth over 1 trillion German dollars? It was because of hyperinflation that the currency was significantly devalued. 

Hopefully now you understand why your disbelief/doubt isn’t founded in the correct framework, ie price in ::insert:: currency.

You have to look at mechanisms, such as intrinsic value (ie network effect), supply/demand effects (ie only 21M coins, fixed supply), and relative value (2.2-4T BTC and Gold is 30T and currency is around 100-120T), to really understand the potential of BTC.

Also, if your salary is decreasing in purchasing power over time, why would switching to a fixed money supply change that?

Of course you are correct about how it should be used... but politicians gonna politic - and that means they will never be able to stop pressing the money printer button. Once they print once then they would have to institute austerity measures and/or raise taxes to balance the budget. No politician is going to do that - there will always be another ""emergency"" that means they ""have"" to run the money printer again.  And then the debt keeps increasing and the % of revenues it takes to pay the interest on that debt keeps increasing. The only way the system keeps going is by printing more and more and constantly devaluing the currency. Nothing stops this train. 

Yes, Bitcoin is a superior money to gold, but why do you think any country's leaders would stick to a Bitcoin standard system any more than they have the gold standard?

If money has a fixed supply and government's are not able to increase the supply then they are forced to do what you actually suggested and save up an emergency fund. When times are good, save money. Build up a reserve.  When emergencies/hard times hit, spend those reserves.  When the reserves are used up then government is forced to balance the budget.  Short term pain for long term gain, but you don't get re-elected if you are the one implementing the pain part. So no leaders will ever do that if they have a way to run the printer.

---

1. Price target assumptions are speculative
The argument that SOL “should already be worth $1,000–$3,000” assumes a very high level of adoption and that the crypto market will follow Solana’s usage linearly. Historical precedent shows that usage does not always translate directly into price: both EOS and Tron had periods of high transaction throughput and developer activity without achieving sustained market capitalization growth. Saying “usage drives price” ignores external macro factors, regulatory risk, and investor sentiment, which are all major drivers of valuation in crypto.


---

2. Network outages and reliability matter more than the post admits
The post dismisses Solana’s outages as a solved problem, but repeated network failures—even if mitigated—erode confidence from institutional and retail users. Financial applications cannot risk downtime or forks, and Solana’s validator architecture, while fast, creates points of centralization that contributed to past outages. Firedancer and fee markets are solutions in progress, not guarantees.


---

3. Centralization is still an issue
The post claims Solana is “more decentralized than every rollup and sidechain,” but the reality is nuanced. A high validator count does not automatically equate to decentralization if network consensus is dominated by a few large stakers. Ethereum L2s may rely on sequencers, but base-layer decentralization and security remain stronger. Solana’s architecture favors speed over censorship resistance, which could be a risk if regulatory pressures or large stakers act maliciously.


---

4. Unified liquidity isn’t a panacea
The argument that a single shared state is inherently superior ignores the scalability trade-offs. Modular rollups and L2s on Ethereum deliberately fragment execution to achieve higher security, composability, and settlement guarantees. Solana’s single-layer design may simplify liquidity, but it also limits settlement finality, making it vulnerable to congestion and attacks under extreme usage scenarios.


---

5. Institutional adoption is not guaranteed
The post assumes that “once the regulatory structure catches up, institutions will flood in.” History shows that institutions are extremely conservative. Many are still wary of Solana due to past instability, centralization concerns, and regulatory uncertainty. High throughput alone is not enough to convince compliance-heavy actors to commit significant capital.


---

6. Overconfidence in the “asymmetric opportunity”
The bullish post treats short-term price corrections as inconsequential to the thesis, but crypto markets are highly sentiment-driven. A network that sees another outage or a significant loss of user trust could suffer a much larger, longer-term price impact than predicted. Accumulating through Phantom and staking assumes continuous trust and adoption, which is not guaranteed.


---

7. Comparative advantage vs Ethereum may be overstated
While Solana is fast, Ethereum’s modular approach allows for secure settlement, diverse application composition, and composability with L2 ecosystems. Saying Solana “has already won the application layer” is misleading—Ethereum and its rollups host billions in TVL, countless DeFi protocols, and increasingly sophisticated smart contract logic. Solana’s ecosystem is still dwarfed in terms of value secured, risk-adjusted throughput, and composable infrastructure.


---

Summary:

1oauyce,solana,nki5oj8,StatisticianWooden87,2025-10-20T22:47:49,"I'm a huge Solana fan, but the asset isn't being designed to appreciate in value. For good reason: It will increase fees. You don't want to spike the price of SOL and destroy the driver of growth: fast and cheap transactions.  
A high price would also lower staking yields eventually. Better you keep the asset at a reasonable price (under 200 USD) and stable and that means LSTs and native staking are reliable returns. You don't want to underestimate the damage sub 3% staking yields are doing to ETH staking long term. And whilst ETH might have more ETH in LSTs, Solana has always had a much higher overall staking rate.

BTC holdings are nothing compared to savings deposits, and the only way to use BTC is to sell it, and we've seen what even small sell-offs (relative to the size of the overall BTC market) can do to the price.  
You can withdraw and spend yield in a lot more sustainable way. At a lower, stable, price SOL can be a multiples bigger MC simply via managed inflation. If new SOL is absorbed with no impact that's a growth engine. People hate volatility. No one fully trusts assets that wildly swing in value.

Anyway, after the unmitigated disaster ""ultrasound money"" was on Ethereum (which saw apps and user encouraged to LEAVE the L1) and the brainrot 'digitial gold' of BTC (most BTC isn't even traded on the Bitcoin blockchain anymore... FM....), seeing a blockchain win by simply doing a heap of what it's designed to do, process transactions, is incredibly bullish.

The biggest 'line go up' opportunity in Solana isn't SOL itself: it's the apps.

BAM (from Jito) and Apenglow open the door to application level sequencing. Which is to say, there is no reason why a popular app needs to leave to build it's own chain to capture more of the value it's sending to the L1 and control the experience for their users. They can do that on Solana. SOL sees less value in each individual circumstance but a heap more value overall as big apps don't feel like they leave the L1 to compete.",1,False,,t3_1oauyce,0

Sticking with the book example, PoW is like finding a word that you could stick at the end of the book so that the sum ends with a specific number.


The difference between the book example and sha256 is that while you could calculate what word to add exactly at the end of a book to achieve the desired result, an sha256 changes drastically and randomly with even the smallest of changes so you can’t predict it.

Zhao had pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws in 2023, serving a four-month sentence, and Binance paid a $4.3 billion fine. The pardon could accelerate Binance's return to the U.S. and ease regulatory restrictions. Democrats are expected to challenge the move, citing potential financial ties between Binance and Trump's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial.

I’m honestly curious. Isn’t it reasonable to have less than 100% of your portfolio in crypto? Or are most people here fully all-in?

Thank you for your message regarding the availability of the iShares Bitcoin ETP on the platform.

While our investment view remains that Bitcoin is not an asset class and we do not believe cryptocurrencies possess the characteristics necessary for inclusion in long-term investment portfolios focused on growth or income, we do recognise that some clients wish to speculate in this area. Accordingly, we are developing a service to enable appropriate clients to access crypto Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs), with trading expected to be available early next year.

Please note that crypto ETNs have been classified by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as Restricted Mass Market Investments (RMMIs), and as such, are considered high-risk and not suitable for all retail clients. Before being permitted to trade, clients will need to complete an appropriateness assessment, and in some cases, exposure to such products may be limited to 10% of a client’s total portfolio.

In relation to your specific query, we are aware that several providers, including CoinShares, have launched physically backed crypto ETNs listed on the London Stock Exchange, which is a requirement set by the FCA for crypto ETN accessibility. While the iShares Bitcoin ETP is not currently available on the HL platform, we continue to assess client interest and the range of eligible ETNs available on UK exchanges. Should sufficient demand be identified, we may look to make such products available in due course.

I hope this has been of assistance. If you have any further questions, please reply by secure message from your HL account. Please note that attachments we send will only be available to view on our website and not on the HL App.

A cryptocurrency promoted in January by US first lady Melania Trump was part of a sophisticated fraud that ""leveraged celebrity association and'borrowed fame' to sell legitimacy to unsuspecting investors,"" a new legal filing has alleged. In April, crypto investors brought a federal class action lawsuit against Benjamin Chow, cofounder of crypto exchange Meteora, and Hayden Davis, cofounder of crypto venture capital firm Kelsier Labs, among other defendants, accusing them of a multimillion-dollar fraud involving a single memecoin, $M3M3. Later, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, expanding the allegations to include racketeering activity. They claimed the pair had colluded to rig the market for $LIBRA, a coin promoted by Javier Milei, president of Argentina, which collapsed in value shortly after launch.

So apparently nothing filed against Melania / Trump directly. I didn't see the whole article since it was paywalled, but kinda weird that they don't even name who filed it. 

But on

Looks like it's a guy named Jonathan Clarke along with Rodrigo Ferreira Da Cruz Vogt, and when he first filed it, he filed it incorrectly lol. 

Not saying that all the Trump crypto stuff is okay, but it's sorta clickbait too. Kind of interesting at least.

>“Publicly, M3M3 was presented as a Meteora project,” the suit reads. “In reality, M3M3 was a collaboration between Meteora and Chow, on the one hand, and defendant Kelsier, a venture capital firm run by the Davis defendants (a father and two sons),” adding that the defendants concealed their involvement.""",4,False,,t3_1ocoki7,0

It's not such a good place for capital owners, but it turns out that doesn't matter for the strength of the economy.


Western economists can complain all they want but they are the most habitually incorrect group on the planet, next to astrologers.

For example how everyone was freaking out about their alleged over production of houses. That was supposed to take down their entire economy.

China is able to recognize challenges, make plans, and put resources behind it. The USA isn't even able to keep the government open, and seems to be on the brink of a civil war

Sweet!  How does the staking work for these?  You just get the yield gains and have no risks from entry and exit queue times?  Seems like a no brainer to hold these then compared to other ways to stake.  I’m growing increasingly worried about the exit queue growing because that was one of my top signals.  It would really suck to miss the top because you are waiting 45 days for your ETH to unlock.

The message is simple...we are close!!

The world is noticing that tokenization and stable coins will mainly happen on Ethereum. Many of the largest players are now building on ETH!!

In the US, most merchants will accept Stable coins soon. Think about what that will do to adoption in the next couple years? What percent of the US has a crypto wallet now and will have one within two years? The visionaries have already started building on ETH and its getting close to where countries, banks, rush to launch stable coins in order to reduce cost and integrate into the new crypto economy and not to be left behind to competition (many are already scrambling). Most countries will have a stable coin, once that happens their citizens will probably start getting wallets (think about the global adoption that will create).

Stable coins are going to bring in the world to crypto and it isn't a dream or vision anymore. It's already starting to happen.

So while this is happening, DAT's are continuing to buy ETH while inflation is less than BTC. Monthly ETH ETF inflows have been higher than BTCs while BTC has over 4X MC.

ETH staking ETFs are about to be approved. I think this will incentivize more companies to hold ETH on their balance sheets.

What some of us have been patiently waiting for is now right around the corner. I believe ETH price is going to explode before the end of the year. Once the seal is broken, I think the future of ETH price will not look like the past.

I know its been a rough ride but hang on tight, we are just one large catalyst away from take off. 

Lastly, Best of Luck to Everyone!!",55,False,,t3_1nvut5r,0

The current ratio is a complete joke.

***Bitcoin, ethereum get bullish 12-month price targets from Citi***

*Citi updated its price targets for the two largest cryptocurrencies in a note Wednesday, predicting a 12-month target of $181,000 for* [*bitcoinBTC $120,482.12 (1.46%)*](https://robinhood.com/us/en/crypto/BTC/?source=sherwood) *and $5,440 for* [*ethereumETH $4,472.79 (2.13%)*](https://robinhood.com/us/en/crypto/ETH/?source=sherwood)*.*

*While overall, Citi analyst Alex Saunders wrote that the firm is “more positive on Bitcoin compared to Ether, as it captures an outsized portion of incremental flows into crypto markets,” he trimmed bitcoin’s year-end price target to $133,000 from $135,000, citing a stronger dollar and weaker gold price as offsetting factors.*

*Ethereum, on the other hand, got a price target bump up to $4,500* [*from $4,300*](https://sherwood.news/crypto/citi-analysts-ethereum-will-drop-to-usd4-300-by-end-of-year/) *by year-end due to flows surging following “stablecoin regulation increasing interest in the network and* [*tokenization*](https://sherwood.news/crypto/what-to-know-crypto-industry-tokenization-grows/) *and the rise of DATs.”*

*Many of the splashiest entries into the digital asset treasury (DAT) space have been ethereum-based treasuries lately, with companies like* [*BitMine Immersion TechnologiesBMNR $56.10 (7.50%)*](https://robinhood.com/stocks/BMNR?source=sherwood) *and* [*SharpLink GamingSBET $17.97 (4.15%)*](https://robinhood.com/stocks/SBET?source=sherwood) *launching DATs and stockpiling huge amounts of ethereum in just the* [*second half*](https://sherwood.news/crypto/joseph-lubin-cofounder-of-ethereum-and-chairman-of-sharplink-gaming-on-how/) *of* [*this year*](https://sherwood.news/crypto/peter-thiels-fund-reveals-9-1-stake-in-bitmine-shares-explode-higher/)*.*

*Bitmine now holds 2,650,900 ETH worth $11.7 billion, while SharpLink has 838,728 ETH worth $3.7 billion. To put that in context,* [*StrategyMSTR $350.90 (4.15%)*](https://robinhood.com/us/en/stocks/MSTR?source=sherwood)*, the* [*largest corporate bitcoin holder*](https://sherwood.news/crypto/strive-to-merge-with-semler-scientific-to-form-the-fastest-growing-corporate/)*, has 640,031 BTC worth $47.3 billion.*

Yes, I do not consider ETH an altcoin.

And even though I owned zero altcoins, and many of them went to *literal* zero yesterday, and are at an All Time Low right now, I still have no interest in investing even $10 in any of them.

Sure, there are some great dApps. AAVE. Uniswap. ENS. Rocketpool. Arbitrum. Optimism. But, I use them without ever interacting with their token. I had no FOMO to buy when token X or Y was worth $500, and I have no interest or reason to buy now that it's worth $0.5 and has the marketcap of a lemonade stand.

In my mind, the Altcoin experiment is over, and has failed. The death of Solana (it will happen sooner or later, maybe when its blockchain reaches three Exabytes?) will be further proof. I had some fun with it for a while (when I was salty at its outperformance over ETH for like a year), made some beer money, got some airdrops, and got out.

If your response is going to be ""bottom signal for Alts"", sure, maybe you can make 2-3X if you hit the correct one in the casino, but it will still be true that they need 10X at best and 10000X at worst to even go back to where they stood in 2021.

So, where does this leave us? What's the thesis? Well, there's only one coin besides BTC that feels ""alive"". That has volume, activity, metrics compared to BTC. That has managed to not die for ten years, and is also the ***ONLY***  coin that hit a new ATH for three cycles in a row... every single cycle it has existed. No other coin has managed that. Every coin launched in 2015 is long forgotten by now. It would be as exceptional as Feathercoin still hitting new ATHs. (A notable exception is the first Altcoin, Litecoin, but even that ranges around the price it had in 2013.)


Only Ethereum can challenge Bitcoin now. And it would have no chance of doing so, if Bitcoin wasn't so *bad*. And even so, it has to become *perfect*. Absolutely perfect. In decentralization, in scaling, in speed, in UX. You can't defeat the network effect of Bitcoin any other way.

But... this might take a while. It could take years. Many years.

So, for now, I am still wearing my white Crab priest cloak.

1o3mwcl,ethereum,nix49p1,superphiz,2025-10-11T11:30:59,"October 10 was a bloodbath, that's the only way to describe it. 

Like a lot of other people, I thought about it all night, and here's what I want to tell you: 

Don't be deterred. Don't give up. But if what happened yesterday made you want to fold, your strategy might need adjustment. If you really believe Ethereum is an inferior technology that will eventually fail, then I encourage you to sell what you hold gracefully and move to a more sound investment.

But if you believe that Ethereum is a wise long term investment and you recognize October 10 as a political and strategic move by market makers, then I need you to be smarter than them.  Keep some lowball orders open all the time. Keep some stables on reserve all the time. Cash out a little when you feel giddy about the price. 

The truth is, I don't give a shit about markets, but I do care about decentralizing the technology, and that means empowering a lot of diverse individuals to build and maintain market positions and participate with the network in lots of ways (making transitions, self custody, running nodes, staking, engaging in community, etc.)

The politicians and market makers don't give one flying fuck about you. They are the enemy. They orchestrate these events to shake cheap coins from the tree. They'll even dump hard into a crash so they can amplify it. I think you know why... They are greedy and manipulative and hell bent on making more money at any cost - even the cost of your well-being and sanity. Make no mistake, crashes are a primary tool that industry uses to consolidate power and control. In a thriving and unregulated market, market makers will shake tf out of trees to get you to give up your position so they can be stronger.

I'm telling you this so you can stop caving to their will, so you can be a strong formidable opponent instead of a scared retail investor. You do not have to be weak, and you do not have to be scared because you know what your opponent is doing and they absolutely do not hold your best interest.

It's not a pep talk, and I'm not telling you to have diamond hands. I'm saying that I believe that the ultimate success of this technology is built on deep decentralization and that means educating the people I care about on the tactics of those who would piss on us for their own benefit.

1o3mwcl,ethereum,nj0egih,nick_badlands,2025-10-11T23:17:01,"Wow, I appreciate yesterday was a seismic dump but the comments in this thread are way too bearish.  What was the reason for the dump yesterday that actually affects Ethereum?  Trump tweeted something.  Come one guys, you're better than this.

The dump yesterday was spectacular but it happened because of all the degens gambling on leverage.  If you're a long term holder of spot ETH, this should've been just another day in the crazy world of crypto.  If you're suddenly bearish about Ethereum after yesterday, ask yourself why.  Has anything changed fundamentally since yesterday?  It's actually pretty bullish for ETH.

I've seen loads of complaints and blame being placed on CEXs yesterday.  Binance, Coinbase, Kraken; despite what their reputation is, they all failed at certain points yesterday.  Uniswap, AAVE, Chainlink and other DeFi protocols all worked absolutely fine.  We saw a spike in fees on ETH but everything worked.

If you were someone that got wiped out or suffered massive losses, you must've been using leverage.  If you were holding spot ETH, well nothing really happened other than the USD value went down, you still have your ETH.  Crypto is one of the most volatile assets in the world, there is no need to use leverage if you have a long term view.  Try not to get caught up in the feeling ""I could be making more money"" that is so easy to slip into if you read about people making crazy gains in the latest trending coins.  Leverage looks really tempting if you let this feeling take hold of you.  Have conviction in your crypto holdings, don't chase the trends and really don't ever use leverage unless you really know what you are doing.

Ethereum will be fine, price will recover and in hindsight, this will be seen as a good test of DeFi vs. CEXs.  Someday, and we're getting closer, all of global finance will run on blockchain.  Yesterday was good proof that we're getting closer to being able to handle that.",49,False,,t3_1o3mwcl,0

No, I need a higher staking yield than that. Why would I hold an asset that only earns 3% per year? I could get that with a treasury bond. I’m here to make it big in crypto, not copy my grandma’s portfolio.

No, I need to buy something that’s less expensive. If I can only buy 0.005 of a coin, how am I going to make money? Bitcoin is different because it’s divisible.

> Stablecoins like USDC offer a revolutionary pivot... efficiently transfer value across borders, bypassing traditional banking systems and eliminating many associated risks....Lower transaction costs compared to traditional banking. As low-fee alternatives to traditional money transfer methods, stablecoins can facilitate global transfers without foreign exchange fees. As the integration of stablecoins into the banking system continues, they promise to reshape the financial world, offering enhanced efficiency, inclusivity and innovation.

Maybe they heard of it on Jon Oliver or something but they are always angling for what they should buy as an investment. I send them to my [Rabbit Hole](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-rabbit-hole) post. I do not tell them to buy crypto.

If you’re worried about centralization risk (like what happens if infra providers or RPCs get hit), a few things that help are: running your own validator/RPC, spreading activity across multiple wallets, and keeping assets in self-custody. Solana’s still young, but the decentralization is improving over time.

For swaps, I usually stick to aggregators so I don’t have to think about which bridge/DEX is up or down. Rubic on r/Rubic, for example, pulls liquidity from hundreds of providers across 100+ chains, including Solana, so you’ve got fallback routes if one service is pressured.",1,False,,t3_1nv6c05,0

1o2s0fu,ethereum,nisugjf,No-Scratch3795,2025-10-10T17:51:57,"I would like to write something about mass adoption.

I asked a few people at my company about cryptocurrencies. The answers were more than sobering. 95% of those surveyed are not familiar with ETH.

However, 70-80% have at least heard of BTC, BUT (I estimate) 99% have no idea how crypto works.

People are afraid of self-custody, are afraid or don't know how to register on an exchange (note: people have no problem with banks, but as soon as the word “exchange” comes up, they become uncertain).

They don't know what a wallet is, and when it comes to word paraphrase, even the last ones decide not to buy. (Because it's too complicated)

The worst thing is that even though crypto has demonstrably risen so much and the forecasts are good, very few of the people I surveyed want to invest in crypto because they have no confidence in the asset.

WHY? Yes, there are countless press articles from the past about fraud, pyramid schemes, and crime. And that's exactly what stuck in everyone's minds.

In addition, there are no educational initiatives on how to deal with cryptocurrencies, how to acquire them, etc. You have to teach yourself everything, and most people are not willing or even able to do so.

I think all the crypto foundations that exist and have a lot of money should use it to promote and educate people about crypto. Otherwise, mass adoption will not happen anytime soon.

And the entire user environment needs to be made much, much simpler.

Leaked GitHub Credentials/Token led to exfiltration of backend API keys which led to funds stolen for one Kiln client. 

This rightfully forced them to rotate all keys out of rightful security concerns.

I'd feel bad about the employee that leaked the API key but I'm sure he tried to vibe code at this point lol

1o1xahl,ethereum,nincf1w,Papazio,2025-10-09T20:25:54,"Here’s a snippet of just how far behind the UK is…

Exchange Traded Notes (ETN) which don’t actually hold the underlying but aim to match the index have sort of but not really yet launched for crypto. They are approved (albeit a few days late) for UK brokers but can’t realistically start trading until next week in most instances. 

HMRC (UK tax man) has sort of but not really clarified how these crypto ETNs can be purchased within tax free ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts). For the next 6 months they can be purchased in regular Stocks & Shares ISAs, however from the new tax year you’ll need to find a provider that can offer you an ‘Innovative Finance ISA’ and they likely won’t be available in S&S ISAs but might actually be. 

Long term crypto ETNs may again be available in S&S ISAs as the market ‘matures’, HMRC will monitor use, performance, and demand. 

When the vested interests are hundreds of years old, 15 years is not yet enough time to mature an asset enough to offer permanent safe and regulated financial products. 

For context, the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK forces the burden for crypto-scammed customers onto retail banks. If you willingly send money to an exchange to buy crypto and send it of your own volition to a scammer, the bank has to take the losses up to £85,000. As such, most UK retail banks have banned or highly restricted transactions to crypto exchanges. So you’d think some safe, regulated, supervised, financial products would help with all of the above issues… but no, the UK authorities have decided to remain behind the times and on the side of scammers.",9,False,,t3_1o1xahl,0

Their CTO presented suggestions for building a clearer framework for stablecoin use and KYC/AML compliance. Kinda interesting seeing an infra project like Lumia (built with Polygon CDK / zkEVM) building policy directly with lawmakers.

If this leads to more regulatory clarity for stablecoin issuers + tokenized assets, it might accelerate institutional adoption on Ethereum-based L2s.

Today, I want to double down on why you should never ever use leverage, full stop, in a market as volatile as crypto. And I will do it by sharing my own experience.

So, I was always more of a holder than a trader. But back in 2017–2018, MakerDAO was shiny and new.. the first time you could use leverage decentrally, fully non-custodially, on-chain. I got excited by the concept and wanted to try it out.. but of course, I told myself I would play it ultra-safe.

Ether had just done a wild 10x run in autumn 2017, all the way up to $1,400 per ETH. Then the market crashed 70%, recovered a bit, and fell again to around $400 in the summer of 2018. With prices down 70% from the top and six to seven months into a bear market, everyone figured this must be the double bottom. That’s when I told myself, let’s go.. and I opened a MakerDAO position with what I thought was a huge safety margin. I would have been fine with another 60% drop. Liquidation would only happen around $150 per ETH.

But no. ETH dropped another 50% to around $200. That’s when I decided to double down.. I mean, come on, down another 50% from where I entered with leverage, now 85% from the top. The market had to turn, right?

Wrong again. In November 2018 it fell another 50%. I would have survived if ETH had stayed above $100. I didn’t want to deploy more capital, so I just let the position ride, hoping I would get lucky and avoid liquidation around $80. Wrong again. ETH flushed to the low low of $80.. and I got liquidated.

Over the next six months the market climbed back to $300 (by then I was done with leverage for good). But just for the record, before the 2020 bull run even began, ETH dipped below $100 twice more.

Now, that was a time when things were probably simpler. Today we have decentralized perpetual platforms with massive liquidity, layered on top of a political and regulatory environment that seems to have no issue with front-running, insider trading, probably even being part of the game itself.

So again.. why would anyone in their right mind use leverage in this market?",41,False,,t3_1o5ascn,0

I'll copy/pasta the whole thing..

Roughly $60–90M of $USDe was dumped on Binance, along with $wBETH and $BNSOL, exploiting a pricing flaw that valued collateral using Binance’s own order-book data instead of external oracles.

That localized depeg triggered $500M–$1B in forced liquidations, cascaded into $19B+ globally, and earned the attackers about $192M via $1.1B in BTC/ETH shorts opened on Hyperliquid hours earlier, but minutes before Trump tariff announcement.

It wasn’t a USDe failure!! It was Binance’s design flaw, timed with macro panic (Trump’s tariffs) for cover.

What looked like chaos was actually a coordinated exploitation of Binance’s internal pricing system, amplified by a macro shock and systemic leverage.

1️⃣ The Setup

Binance’s Unified Account let traders use assets like USDe, wBETH, and BNSOL as collateral.

Instead of oracle or redemption prices, Binance valued these using its own spot market - a major vulnerability.

On Oct 6, Binance announced a fix to move to oracle-based pricing, but rollout wasn’t until Oct 14, leaving an 8-day window.

2️⃣ The Exploit

During that window, sophisticated actors manipulated Binance’s order books, dumping ~$60–90M of USDe, driving it to $0.65 on Binance only (still ~$1 elsewhere).

Because the Unified Account marked collateral to internal prices, this instantly wiped margin value and triggered $500M–$1B in forced liquidations.

Then, Trump’s 100% China tariff headline hit, magnifying panic and liquidity stress.

3️⃣ The Profit Engine

The same day, fresh wallets on Hyperliquid opened $1.1B in BTC/ETH shorts, funded by $110M USDC from Arbitrum-linked sources.

As the Binance cascade unfolded, BTC and ETH cratered, those shorts netted $192M in profit before closing out at the bottom.

Timing, precision, and funding paths all suggest coordination.

4️⃣ The Contagion

Binance liquidations dumped BTC/ETH/ALTs into thin books.

Other exchanges mirrored the collapse through cross-market bots.

Market makers hedged across venues were forced to unwind everywhere.

Result: $19B+ global liquidations, with many alts down 50–70% intraday, all triggered by <$100M of manipulated collateral.

5️⃣ Who’s at fault?

Binance: design flaw + delay in oracle rollout = root cause.

Exploiters: executed and timed the manipulation, profited via external shorts.

Ethena (USDe): not at fault - protocol stayed 1:1 collateralized, redemptions normal, peg held everywhere else.

6️⃣ Aftermath

Binance admitted “platform-related issues,” promised compensation for affected margin/futures/loan users, and rolled out minimum price floors + oracle integration.

USDe remained operational, and the incident is now a case study in how exchange-side pricing errors can trigger system-wide liquidations.

Bottom line:
A ~$90M dump on Binance and a $1.1B leveraged short elsewhere sparked a $19B bloodbath.

Not a stablecoin failure, but a masterclass in exploiting flawed collateral valuation during peak macro stress.",46,False,,t3_1o4gfa7,0

\- Never use leverage. Ever. Full stop. Leverage is a mechanism designed to make you sell at the worst possible moment at a terribly lower price.

\- When staring at charts (we all do!), zoom out. Use weekly intervals, and most importantly, switch to log scale.

\- Only invest what you can truly afford to lose. Don’t try to time the market. Instead, make a deal with yourself to stay invested for a long time - no matter what. At least two full multi-year cycles, measured from bottom to bottom.

\- Have a plan to take profits. Not all at once, but gradually, over time, especially when the market feels overheated. Acknowledge that this will be hard, because it means selling when sentiment is highest.

\- And lastly, find something meaningful to do outside of crypto. Touch grass regularly.

When it comes to sustainability of the core devs / main client devs workstreams, how would they fare if there was no EF support? How self-sustainable are they excluding any non Ethereum L1 or L2 aligned opportunities?

Without the EF how likely is that they keep a coherent strategic direction that is beneficial to Ethereum as an ecosystem?

Performance leeway easened to 95%, which is very lax.

Obviously solo staking is better (I do that too) and RP staking as well (also) but most stake through exchanges or hold liquid staking tokens. 13 ETH or about 21 ETH for 16 keys gets you very good terms/rewards (maybe 5-8k USD a year 16 keys, new terms and 4500 ETH price) and it can be fun to set up a machine.

Yes, a rewards program is on the way.   
  
Any of the details you've previously seen/heard are not indicative of what is to actually launch. Let's talk a little bit about what the actual MetaMask Rewards program WILL be.  
  
This program will yield referral rewards, mUSD incentives, exclusive partner rewards, access to tokens, and more.  
  
However, it is not a farming play. It is shaping up to be one of the largest onchain rewards programs ever built - in MetaMask Rewards Season 1 alone, we'll be distributing over $30M in LINEA token rewards.  
  
We're intending for this to be a genuine method of regularly giving back to our community.  
  
And to the OGs... we see you.   
  
Long-time MetaMask users will not be ignored - they'll be given special benefits, and MetaMask Rewards will have meaningful connections with the future MetaMask token.  
  
We’ll have more details to share and will be rolling out the full program in the next couple of weeks.

The lower gain might be tolerable if ETH also fell less during dumps and acting more like a safe asset, but that’s not the case. From the late August peak to the late September bottom, ETH dumped 23%. Compare that to BTC’s -13%, SOL’s -17%, and BNB’s -14%. Holding ETH is the riskiest when everything is red.

I mean, we dumped to $1300 (while BTC was steady above its previous cycle ATH) in April ffs. The people who bought at 4k in December had to stomach that, yet despite all the “institutional interest” and billions in ETF inflows, they’re barely above breakeven. It’s fucking pathetic.

- **Never connect your main wallet to unverified dApps**: Use a different wallet or don’t connect at all! This reduces exposure to potential threats. Only click on **official** project links posted through **verified** social media channels. Double and triple check! 

- **Use a hardware wallet for enhanced security**: These wallets store your keys offline, making them much more human proof.

*Ant Group's Ethereum-based Jovay aims for 100k transactions per second, potentially transforming global finance infrastructure.*

[*Ant Group*](https://cryptoslate.com/circle-eyes-china-market-alipay-integration-amid-reported-ant-group-partnership/) *is betting that the next leap in digital finance will not happen in a bank but on* [*Ethereum*](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/)*.*

*On Oct. 14, the Chinese fintech giant behind Alipay’s 1.4 billion-user payment network* [*launched*](https://x.com/JovayNetwork/status/1978068288405225796) *Jovay, a new Layer-2 (L2) blockchain built atop Ethereum to move real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain at institutional scale.*

***What is Jovay?***

*Ant Digital, the blockchain division of Ant Group, describes Jovay as a “compliance-first, AI-assisted scaling network” that aims to integrate real-world data and value flows into decentralized finance.*

*The platform uses dual provers, a zero-knowledge and optimistic hybrid, to ensure both scalability and verifiability. It deliberately launches without a native token, signaling a focus on enterprise and institutional adoption rather than retail speculation.*

*The implications are vast. Alipay has 1.4 billion monthly active users and handles trillions in payment volume annually. If even a fraction of that activity migrates to Ethereum rails through Jovay, the network could become one of global finance’s most consequential infrastructure bridges.*

*According to Jovay’s technical* [*paper*](https://docs.jovay.io/guide/jovay-white-paper#_5-rwa-smart-tokenization-on-jovay)*, the network achieved 15,700 – 22,000 transactions per second (TPS) during testnet trials and targets 100,000 TPS through node clustering and horizontal expansion.*

Sentiment in Crypto has taken a massive hit, primarily due to Trump, Binance (and others), as well as speculators who leveraged hundreds of millions through lets face it likely inside information.

We now know that Crypto can crash on a tweet, and a bad tweet (worse than the China levies) could put things into a spiral.

We can also see it is blatantly rigged.

Think it demonstrated to many who were not aware and happily leveraged that the whole market is rigged, and not in their favour. With 1.5M wipeouts - it will take a long time to regain any confidence. A lot of those 1.5M will *never* return.

Suspect real losses are FAR higher than the information available, perhaps even 50 billion, or more. Binance immediately offering a quarter of a billion dollars in 'compensation' makes me think how much did they make out of this? I have ZERO faith in them.

I exited a 2X leverage that barely survived with a 40K loss - market has crawled up since then but I don't regret it. Have 100K (approx) unleveraged now in ETH and really thinking hard about what to do in the next few hours. Stable'ish at 4K but for how long.

Yes, may drop to 2K, lose 50K, and yes, likely will come back.... but I will always realize now we are all one tweet away from anything happens.

Too much uncertainty even for Crypto.

The stench of corruption and greed is too much.

I still put funds in here and there during the notable dips but not as much as I used to for the same reason as you (not all eggs in one basket). 

Since then, for fun, I set up a solo lottery miner (with a gekkoscience compac f miner and a raspberry pi)... it's fun to check the numbers every now and then, and the energy is only 2 to 4 dollars per month - this is worth it to me for the fun of it. And I've determined my odds are equivalent to buying about 10 powerball tickets per day.

Anyway, now when I have investing money, I throw the majority of it into my Roth IRA (which is a post-tax investment - meaning in 50 years or whatever whenever I can claim my returns, I don't pay tax on it... also, you can freely take out any amount without penalty UP TO the amount you've invested - so its like a 12% return savings account with compounding interest - the catch being you can only put in 7k per year or something like this, but like I said, I'm a normal 29 year old in today's age and 7k is a lot for me to have extra anyway). I set this up on vanguard, I'd recommend looking into it. I only buy into VTSAX as its a good representation of the entire market. 

I hope any of this helps. And I still dabble with more sats here and there, but like you, I'm fairly happy with the goal I've met (but like others have said, I do have a mental *next* goal.. I'm just not going all in for it anymore).",1,False,,t3_1oh7b9l,0

**GOLD.**

The world’s real gold market cap is around **$30 trillion**, yet almost no one in crypto is talking about its digital reflection.  
When everything crashes, gold holds.  
When narratives fade, gold shines again.

And now, as **gold is about to break its ATH at $4,381**, the digital gold narrative is starting to wake up.

Here’s why it matters:

* 🌕 **RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization** is coming fast. Stablecoins and digital gold will drive the next bull run.
* 🪙 **Trust is utility.** Gold-backed and gold-themed assets have the strongest psychological link to real value.
* 🔥 **Meme energy meets intrinsic value.** The next big memecoin will have both — hype and heritage.
* 💎 **From the trenches to the top.** The ones who dig early will be the ones holding real digital gold when the market catches up.

As far as I know the report is not yet publicly available, but news sites report about it already. As expected Ethereum has the largest active developer share overall and also the majority of new developers flocked to Ethereum. Ethereum has a pretty nice lead and growth overall.

Obviously, Solana does not like to lose in gameable metrics, so the head of developers relation made a large commit to the electric capital github repository to make sure all the solana developers are ""properly"" tracked. They wanted to add 7816 solana repositories. As expected many of these repositories are dead, have nothing to do with Solana or are even Ethereum repositories. I am sure the goal was that Solana devs are are counted properly...

The Solana devrel even wanted to list Nethermind, an Ethereum client, as a Solana repository. Yes, really. 

The electric capital maintainer of the repo filtered through the list and with a minimal filter and suggests to throw out more than a third of the entries. I looked at a handful of projects on that list myself and I have to say it looks like 80% are either non existent, not solana related or not really more than a person copy pasting a tutorial. 

I am not really really surprised by that behavior of the solana devrel, but I am still disappointed that they manage to lower the bar even further.

My post ([Twitter link](https://x.com/ethereum/status/1980691326472757639)) starts by introducing the concept of client diversity, one of the primary reasons for Ethereum's impressive track record of zero downtime. The main topic of the post, however, are multi-node validator clients. I'm the maintainer of one such validator client called [Vero](https://vero.docs.serenita.io/).

Multi-node validator clients connect to different Ethereum clients (think Geth, Lighthouse, ...) simultaneously, combine their data, and only cast a validator vote if multiple Ethereum clients agree on the state of the chain. This way, validators can make sure they are not voting for an invalid chain.

Remember [how the Holešky testnet blew up a few months ago](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Network-Upgrade-Archive/Pectra/holesky-postmortem.md)? Back then, an invalid chain was voted on by more than 2/3 of the network, causing mass slashings, and resulted in a network that was very difficult to get back online at all. Now imagine that kind of thing happening on mainnet. It would be catastrophic for Ethereum.

A client-diverse, Vero-powered setup would _not_ have voted for that invalid Holešky chain. If we'd had higher adoption of those kinds of setups, we would have saved ourselves a lot of trouble.

It's too late for Holešky now, but it's not too late for mainnet. With Vero, I hope to make Ethereum even more resilient than it is today.

A few FAQs for the stakers around here.

> What about DVT? That also protects against client bugs, right?

Currently, DVT only protects against downtime bugs, not consensus bugs. Both SSV and Obol are working on addressing this, so that will help at some point in the future.

I personally believe multi-node validator clients, like Vero and Vouch, are the better choice for validators managed by a single entity, whereas DVT shines when multiple node operators are involved.

> I'm a home staker, should I use Vero?

You _can_. It's free, open-source. It's simple enough to set up, even for home stakers, and gives you additional protection. Having said that, I believe the true responsibility to run these more complex, multi-node setups lies with the professional staking node operators out there.

Some more FAQs are answered in the [docs](https://vero.docs.serenita.io/introduction/faqs/).

It has bluetooth which makes it more mobile friendly than the older trezor wallets. It will be available in a month for around $250 or 250 Euro.  

What makes this announcement special though is that Trezor built their own secure element chip. They created a new company called tropico square which developed this chip (https://tropicsquare.com/). This secure element chip is fully auditable by security experts. Interested parties can order samples without having to sign an NDA and then publish their findings openly. To the best of my knowledge, all other secure element chips need you to sign an NDA and if you find security vulnerabilities you are not allowed to talk about them with anyone else. Trezor said they looked through so many secure element chips and found gaping holes in them which they are not allowed to talk about to anyone and the producer did not care. According to Trezor, many of these vulnerable secure element chips are widely used in the hardware wallet market. The most open secure element chips you could get until today were ones which allowed you to open source the code you ran on them, but most do not even allow that. That is why many hardware wallets are at least partially closed source and you have to trust the manufacturer to a large degree to not change the software under the hood without you knowing.

For me, the introduction of this auditable secure element chip is a very positive development. It will take some time until it will have an impact on the market.

1oc441r,ethereum,nknf9nf,adraffy,2025-10-21T20:13:43,"For ENS, I explored how we could read trustless state from Polygon PoS with [Unruggable](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways) Gateways.  I was able to create a solution ([gateway](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways/blob/main/src/polygon/PolygonPoSRollup.ts) and [verifier](https://github.com/unruggable-labs/unruggable-gateways/blob/main/contracts/polygon/PolygonPoSVerifier.sol)) but it required some additional tech.  This was a year or so ago, so the details are hazy.

The basic idea was there is an immutable [`RootPoster` contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x591663413423dcf7c7806930e642951e0dddf10b), which emits a log containing the [latest blockhash](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x1f67785f7aa68bf0b8592cc4e92710c5dde249c8fea876bd6d1a4211047f1d3b#eventlog).  Eventually, this transaction gets included into a checkpoint that Polygon commits to L1.  You can then use the existing `/exit-payload/` API to generate a proof of that transaction, prove it emitted the log, and prove the value (blockhash) in the log.  

The gateway can supply a witness that contains this exit proof + the block header ingredients.  Combined with the onchain checkpoint, the onchain verifier can verify the exit proof, confirm it matches the block header, and then extract the state root, and then prove arbitrary state on Polygon using additional `eth_getProof`'s.

For a demo, I funded an EoA with a few bucks and ""posted"" hourly blockhashes with a bot for a few weeks.  The contract is trustless so literally anyone can pay gas (eg. [`post()`](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x591663413423dcf7c7806930e642951e0dddf10b#writeContract)) to include a transaction into a checkpoint.

The trust is minimized to the poster contract (which is trivial to audit) and the validity of the checkpoints (which I believe is shared with bridge withdrawals.)  The onchain verifier is bound to a specific poster contract address and Polygon checkpoint contract (`IRootChain`).

It's a protocol building further onto Heroglyphs where you can earn rewards in perpetuity in return for foregoing your validators execution rewards for 6 months.

After 6 months you can graduate and receive an amount of shares equal to your validators attestation rewards over that 6 month period (multiplied by a boost for aligned validators like Stakers Union). 
However, you can only graduate if you (or someone else) proposes a block containing a graffiti with your validator id in it 👀

Execution rewards are accruing 50% in a yield strategy where it earns ~10% apy (in usd value) and 50% is converted to sBOLD and streams directly to the vault where the validators can claim it with their earned shares.
The generated yield is also streamed to the vault, while the principal will earn yield forever for the vault (hence the perpetual rewards).

We hope this makes solo validating a bit more attractive again. Every little effort counts 🫡

 It's just that ETH is not as clear and the reason is likely related with high volatility, speculation and the ""cryptobro"" archetype. 

There is actually some intrinsic value to ETH: it's absolutely necessary to keep the network running (validators) to use the network (fees) and to access liquidity (DeFi collateral). 

Considering that running the network remains an appealing use case (30% staked, trending mostly upwards), usage of the network is increasing (ATH transactions, ATH blob usage) and liquidity keeps increasing (ATH TVL), ETH is a great position.

Which leads to: how much of the current ETH valuation is speculative and how much are the facts above? To me, the facts above set a floor of 3K in fair market value for ETH (number I feel comfortable with, not based on any valuation model) if you remove all the speculation.

But speculation can both push it below (in which case I will buy with both hands as long as intrinsic value remains true) or push it way up (300% overpriced is somewhat normal in a mania phase, so 12K is not unreal for crypto).

What prevents Bitmine, SharpLink, The Ether Machine, Bit Digital, ETHZilla, etc. from using a small amount of “play money” to buy ETH on the open market to spark momentum, while still quietly accumulating OTC? If Bitcoin could be pushed this way, why not Ethereum?

Bank of America estimated that at a $1T BTC market cap, just $93M of net buying could add around $10–11B to its market value - a 118× multiplier. Applying that to ETH, moving from $4K to $10K would require a $726B increase in market cap, which at the same multiplier would mean only about $6B of net buying.

But ETH might react even more sharply. Its market cap is smaller, and roughly 60% of supply is effectively illiquid - around 10.5% in ETFs and strategic reserves, plus \~29% staked. That could put ETH closer to a 200× multiplier, meaning only $3–4B of net open-market buying might be enough to trigger a run toward $10K.

Well, for one I still haven't sold any eth. Ever. Glad to see I'm still top 10 dooters though!

At some point I'll sure sell some though, to make improvements to real life things, but not before $9.4k, that's bare minimum for a 10% out.

Not sure exactly why I'm writing this today. I used to spend so much time here. Being informed and sharing information felt like a necessity. 

But things are running smoothly in Ethereum lands nowadays, most of the problems we had just 3 years ago feel so distant now. 

Path to scalability? Cleared. Regulations? Doing good! Adoption? Going nicely!

What an adventure it's all been. Luckily personal life has followed the same path.

He highlights increased activity in Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, driven by stablecoin demand and high transaction volumes. Lee predicts Ethereum's price will align with its fundamentals by year-end. Despite criticisms and competition from other blockchains, Ethereum has shown resilience, with renewed investor interest and a recent price increase.

But me and other people here are losing hope of seeing crazy high prices for ETH.   
And let's break it down instead of just complaining:

In the last 8+ years, remember these sentences?  
-""when institutions will come, we will be rich""  
-""when Ethereum scales successfully with layer2's and the insane fees are gone, massive price gains will happen""   
-""when we start burning ETH with EIP-1559, the price will skyrocket""  
-""when Ethereum transitions to POS, the 99.9% energy consumption drop and green narrative will finally convince the world to buy ETH""    
-""the 90% issuance drop in ETH from moving to POS, aka the triple halvening will create a supply/demand that will make the price of ETH pump like never before""  
-""when Ethereum enables staking, everyone will buy ETH to stake and the price will go parabolic""   
-""if ETH had a Michael saylor, ETH would be double it's ATH easily""  
(ETH treasury companies now own more % of the supply compared to bitcoin treasuries)  
-""if Ethereum had ETF'S, ETH would be doing as well as BTC""  
-""if Ethereum had a spokesperson to teach everyone about Ethereum, the world would buy ETH""    
(we have etherealize now for a while, huge respect to them)    
""-if Ethereum had someone like Michael saylor to talk about Ethereum on tv and podcasts and interviews, ETH would skyrocket""   
(we have tom lee now)    

Let's be real, Ethereum has so much things happen that this list is probably way longer.  
And there will be many more bullish catalysts for Ethereum because Ethereum's fundamentals and upgrades and upcoming tech is so huge and amazing.  
And there are 2 that i can already think of:  
-""when layer2's start paying for blobs, ETH price will go up""  
-""when ETH ETF'S get staking, tradfi will buy ETH at unseen amounts resulting in huge pumps""  

But i just can't help wondering of that huge list of insane bullish stuff happened and the price is under $4000, then are those 2 new things really going to pump ETH? Or will they be added to the list above, things that are insanely bullish but did nothing for the price...

Again, i remain max bullish for Ethereum and im staying to see this play out because tokenization, stablecoins, ai,... Etc. Is all about to explode and the majority is clearly happening on Ethereum. When all the financial giants are publicly announcing their layer2's and saying tokenization and stablecoins are going to take over the financial world, when trillions of dollars go onchain in the upcoming years, and the exchange ETH reserves going down more than any girl I've ever met, the price of ETH must go up right... There is no way it doesn't, and im fucking staying untill then.

So fuck this depressing dogshit for now, it is what it is, Ethereum is winning, mass adoption is on the horizon, our time will come and ETH will be worth at least 5% more than it is now,...

I have arrived early, thanks to the flexibility of the Ethereum Foundation. I'm exploring the city, of course, but also exploring the opportunities for decentralised and trustless use of crypto in the city.

A few people on Twitter have commented that the need for cash in Buenos Aires has been greatly overstated. I took that mean that I didn't have to worry about carrying cash and I have to say, that has not been my experience at all. I ended up needing to get cash as a matter of urgency:

* The deposit for a towel at the hostel: Cash only.
* First coffee shop I walked into: We do not take cards.
* Subway card: Topping it up can require cash depending on where
* Restaurant for dinner: 15% discount if you pay in cash
* Tips in general: Cash clearly highly preferred

That's not to say you can't pay for many things with card; in fact for my SIM from Claro (specifically for tourists, requires showing a passport), she told me before we started that it was card only.

I was unable to quickly find a means of converting stablecoins to cash through the exchange houses, although it is clear that such places exist. Next step is to try the local apps and see what options there are, although a friend of mine is worried that I seem happy to outsource my survival to apps that crash in dark mode.

I did find one place that was crypto friendly last night: a brightly lit candy shop offering halloween treats and delicious things with a sign on the door: We accept Bitcoin Cash.

I'm now installing a BCH wallet so I can buy some candy and report back. You're welcome.",25,False,,t3_1oi0t8b,0

- Consolidate into their 0x02
- Automatically triggers excess rewards over 2048 ETH to be withdrawn by the protocol.

I think this is bound to create congestion on the consolidation queue and on the withdrawals skimming part too if abused.

What's the point of the exit queue if people start using this approach? This seems like an abuse / unintended exploit of the consensus layer.

I'd say anything that isn't lobbying the government, is going to pump really hard in the future. Most of the current market investment is centered in the lobbyist group crypto networks, and practically most investors don't have the strong will to power through the short-term dips.

First of all, this is just plain incorrect.   There are many scenarios where bitcoin is faster/cheaper than using fiat currency (cash) and/or using third party financial products such as checks, Venmo/apps, credit cards, bank wires, etc.

Obviously bitcoin is not the fastest and cheapest transaction method for all transaction types.  There is no single system that has this quality for all transaction types.

Even though you are wrong with your analysis, I don’t see how this has anything to do with your “Ponzi scheme” accusation.


> That price is massively inflated by made up 'stable coins' minted out of thin air by unregulated exchanges set up by criminals. 

I see no evidence of this.  If anything the ETFs show in real time how much demand there is even using a bitcoin investment product.


> A criminal president resides in the White House who manipulates the price daily, facilitating insider trading for his own family and his rich mates to make bank.

This has nothing to do with bitcoin.

Do you also think the stock market is a Ponzi scheme?  Plenty of politicians buy stocks that they know will get favorable legislation.

It’s not a Ponzi scheme.  Calling it that is just plain wrong.

A Ponzi scheme is a defined scheme and Bitcoin shares literally nothing with a Ponzi scheme.  

Bitcoin is a digital, decentralized monetary network with a fixed supply.  That’s it.

1o724gy,ethereum,njp6ce6,LogrisTheBard,2025-10-15T23:19:46,"Accumulation signals are all positive for the week:

1) We broke 17M exchange reserves on Sept 22. We broke 16M exchange reserves on Oct 8. That's just over 2 weeks later. A week after that we're already at 15.6M so on track to drop another 1M every 2-3 weeks. That's absolutely *wild* amounts of accumulation.

2) $19B in liquidations the other day but only about $700M of ETH ETF outflows. Clearly they aren't driving the drop. On Sept 15th ETFs had 6.7M ETH. Today they have 6.8M ETH. Meanwhile the price has dropped from $4500 to $4000. They're hodling while Web3 natives are noodle handing this. It's really embarrassing.

3) In the same timeframe DATs have acquired another 1.5M ETH. At todays prices that's around $6B of inflows in ~4 weeks. Over $1B a week of hard accumulation from committed never-sellers. $1B a week into an asset with a price elasticity of 10 should mean we're should be coiling up a 2% market cap expansion a week. By that logic if it wasn't for all the eager sellers we should already be 15% above our ATH just given the inflows since then. The spring may just be coiling for the next step function move like we had in July. I certainly hope it happens before EOY.

Everything I can see still says money is flowing into the space and taking ETH in droves off weak handed web3 holders. It's just crazy how much ETH they seem willing to part with given all the hard signs of adoption:

1) YTD stablecoin market cap up almost 50% (~90B). Vast majority of that is on Ethereum. Tron of all things is losing market share. Tether regularly printing billions.

2) We now have 5 companies committed to bringing on tokenized equities. Starting in Sept we are seeing a rocket under the TVL on the already on-chain ones. We've gone from about $80M to $425M in a few short months. Most of these seems to be Ondo rather than Backed or xStocks. This is to say nothing of Robinhood or Blackrock's efforts which are not yet on chain but [sound like they will be substantial](https://youtu.be/-LPit2bEWAo?si=MwvkPfqEGzKHR35J&t=99). Of course the vast majority of TVL and volume is on Ethereum.

Fink: ""I do believe we're at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets from real estate to all equities to bonds - across the board. There $4.1T in money sitting globally in digital wallets.  A lot of that money is outside the United States. If we can tokenize an ETF, digitize it, we could have investors who are just beginning to invest in markets through crypto investing in the more traditional long term retirement products. We look at that as the next wave of opportunity for Blackrock over the next tens of years as we start moving away from traditional financial assets by repotting them in a digital manner and then having people stay in that digital ecosystem.""

Interviewer: ""You weren't always a huge proponent of crypto.""

Fink: ""Yeah but I grow and learn.

3) Speaking of Blackrock the BUIDL fund is up from $650M to $2.8B YTD and we've added a host of other on-chain treasuries from WisdomTree, Franklin, and Fidelity. Again, all Ethereum.

4) Transactions on Ethereum + L2s are up about 50% YTD from 18 to 27M per day.

**""Code is Law""** is a feature-length documentary exploring crypto’s most infamous smart contract hacks - and the attackers who claim they broke no laws.

Beginning with *The DAO* hack, it traces a lineage of exploits - from *Indexed Finance* to *KyberSwap* and *Mango Markets* \- where hackers argued that code, not law, should decide what’s permissible. 

Told through the developers, investors, and investigators at the center of these cases, the film follows the pursuit of figures like teenage math prodigy Andean Medjedovic, who stole $65 million across two attacks and remains a fugitive from FBI charges.

The film is streaming globally from October 21st via Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video and Vimeo on Demand.

1o724gy,ethereum,njos184,LogrisTheBard,2025-10-15T22:00:22,"I watched a [DAT panel video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnVW6clcF88) yesterday from Token 2049 that was surprisingly worth the time. Bunch of alpha here that I'll summarize below:

The mod asked what differentiated each DAT.

1) BitDigital launched some DeAI thing called WhiteFiber. Apparently they own most of it and they plan to use the revenue from it to acquire more ETH. BitDigital is also going the Microstrategy route of using unsecured debt to finance the purchase of more ETH. I also liked this quote: ""If Ethereum and Bitcoin were invented on the same day, you would never have heard of Bitcoin at this point.""

2) Lubin essentially said the link the Consensys was SBet's biggest strength. I don't personally buy this argument but the mechanism for this seems to be that SBet is planning to use ETH to stake and earn yield on Linea and to use the coming Metamask and Linea reward programs to incentivize behavior that benefits strategic investments Consensys is going to make. Obviously this means there's going to be a Metamask token so go farm your airdrops.

3) Bitmine carries around $600M in cash so they can proactively buy the dip of either ETH or BMNR. This explains how they just acquired about 400k ETH during the crash. After they acquire 5% of ETH supply they are going to focus investments in rails to accelerate the adoption of Ethereum by wall street. Tom Lee has described this before as kingmaking and I bet if they come to protocols with $1B of TVL they'll be able to negotiate some kind of bribe/kickback not available to common depositors.

4) The reason Bitmine is buying ETH like there's no tomorrow is they want to solidify their position as being the most liquid DAT and enter index funds like the Russel 1000 during the next rebalance in June 2026. This would make them eligible for investments from about 1500 large cap funds, essentially creating a flywheel of buy pressure on BMNR. This is also why they want to keep their balance sheet as clean as possible, it makes the story for the inclusion of BMNR in those indexes less complicated than if they had side business income like BitDigital or complicated debt like MSTR. They want to get that sovereign wealth fund bid into ETH via including BMNR in major indexes. He says this will pump their mNav to around 2.

5) BMNR has 30% institutional ownership and 330k retail holders. Arc funds from Cathie Wood is a top 10 holder. I'm surprised to hear that given some of her BTC maxi rhetoric in previous years.

Tom Lee goes on for awhile about the importance of liquidity, volatility, implied volatility, etc and how critical this is for BMNR. He mentions several times how they're the 26th highest volume stock in the US and third highest volume stock in some other countries. I'm out of my depth to explain why this is but hopefully someone in here can help. Why is Ethereum being 50% more volatile than Bitcoin a good thing to institutions? What even is an implied volatility of 120? How do you monetize implied volatility in the way he's saying?",22,False,,t3_1o724gy,0

It looks like Paypal accidentally minted $300T of PyUSD into a Paxos cold wallet. A few minutes later all these tokens got burned again. Whatever happened here is a bit embarassing for Paypal, lets hope it just got fat fingered and nothing more nefarious is going on.

Mint transaction:

https:// etherscan.io/tx/0xc45dd1a77c05d9ae5b2284eea5393ecce2ac8a7e88e973c6ba3fe7a18bf45634

UPDATE: About  2 hours later 300 million PyUSD got minted into the paxos cold wallet. Really looks like someone fat fingered a mint transaction and accidentally added 6 zeroes to the transaction. Could also be that something went wrong using the decimals. For example the smallest unit of ETH is wei. 1 ETH is 10^18 wei. So, if you  want to transact ETH you have to manually add 18 zeroes to the amount of ETH you want to transact. Wallets take care of that for you. Most ERC-20 tokens also have 18 decimals. Some exceptions are USDC and PyUSD which only have 6. So could be that this difference in decimals messed up the minting somehow.

Imagine Nvidia being able to tokenize separate aspects of their business so they can tokenize their china chip sales, Blackwell AI focused chips, data center products or gaming chip sets. 

Imagine companies being able to compartmentalize their business sectors and so a tariff against China really doesn't slump the main Nvidia stock just crushes the tokenized asset that represents that sales flow of their business.

What happens if Ethereum swaps to proof generation + proof validation structure, when it comes to incentives for decentralization?

It feels like this would take the block building centralization issues we currently face and apply them to the prover pool, which will be significantly smaller than our current re-execution based validator pool.

In terms of incentives, unless protocol rewards continue to compensate attesters/proposers and don’t over-tilt to provers, it should be okay, but I have the feeling this won't be the case. 

My gut feeling is that provers will absorb most of the protocol rewards on consensus (and rightfully so, as verification will become very lightweight) but the barrier of entry to run a prover setup will be too high for it not to become a centralization vector",20,False,,t3_1o724gy,0

A month to two months later the DAT mania started. Tom Lee makes the statement that he wouldn't mind if ETH stays at 4k for an extended period of time so Bitmine could accumulate, although he didn't/doesn't think they'll get the opportunity to accumulate at 4k for very long. I think he said that some time in August. 

Lubin around that time, maybe in July said something like, over the last 3 or 4 years, the SEC and gov admin wasn't friendly to ETH and during that time a lot of ETH was produced and now is the time for DATs to ""sop"" up the supply.

Today Arthur Hayes or rather yesterday, now says he sees eth at 10k this year (like 75 days to do it? - crazier things have happened) , Tom Lee stays firm on a higher EOY price and although Lubin has been quite lately on price predictions, we know he thinks ETH will go higher this year. 

News/podcasts/words-said in crypto time ages differently. A week feels like a month, a month feels like a year and so forth. 

It's actually hard to believe that DATs have only been at it for a handful of months. Bitmine still seems to be accumulating at record pace, the others have slowed their role. The ETFs are grinding up.

Just some guy in \~2011. Only to create Ethereum afterwards.

  
Interesting little fact right?

Here is a big one:

Sometimes we need to realign our minds to the original mindset of Ethereum and Bitcoin -> liberation. In a world where we face stagnating economies, mounting inequality, political corruption and the increasing monopolization of technology, we must try and fight against these growing forces. That's why we are building a weapon against it, called decentralization. This keyword should NOT and not even have the slightest form of weakness. This is why Ethereum exists how it exists today.

Bitcoin is facing downfall, getting under control of few entities. The concept is mind blowing and powerful. But the execution is starting to crumble. The chain is facing to fail what it was designed to be, libre money!

In a country that is build on the word freedom, we must create tools to fight the forces that try to control you. Not endorce powerfull hoarders to pump your gains. I spit on people like Sailor. He is not a good actor in this space! I spit on ETH reserves trying to hoard it. I spit on chains like BNB, SOL, ADA who only exist to gather money and grab control. Fuck Windows, libre Linux! Screw Nestle, get bent Facebook, up yours Tencent.

Ethereum is the only chain that has liberation fighters at it's core working on it, from all around the world. Linux/GNU is a fine example of comparison, only at the software level. Trying to create value and get rich quick does not even cross their minds when developing on it. 

When people even try to control ETH, the power of decentralization forbids them for even trying.

This is why I believe, and am strongly invested in Ethereum, because freedom is turning into something that will be scarce, and very necessary. Once I see the slightest form of change in this weapon and is losing it's original mindset, so that ETH can be controlled. I'm out. Once I see this weapon perfected and out of hands from everyone, even Buterin and the Foundation. we win!

Also had to sell almost all of my spot holdings substantially lower than the small amounts I sold at $4900 as per my plan.

The real goal, at least IMO, isn’t about timing some exit or chasing a short term pamp. It’s stacking these validators

In this space, (CT in general, and here on Reddit) long-term holders often find themselves surrounded by traders obsessed with daily candles, and alot of that impatience starts to rub off. On the flip side, traders interact with long-term holders who bought in early or have more capital, and they start to feel envy or discouragement instead of inspiration. Both sides end up absorbing the other’s frustrations, and that psychological bleed affects everyone’s conviction (ethtrader to ethfinance daily and now to ethereum daily)

Honestly, hodling BTC and waiting for TradFi to build products so pple can borrow against it or sell when their target is hit doesn’t compare to becoming an ETH validator. Running a validator means earning yield while strengthening Ethereum’s foundation and aligning with its future, I'm preaching to the choir here but..you know, just thought it had to be mentioned.

The PA right now is bittersweet. For new accumulators, it’s a gift stable, steady, and occasionally generous with dips to stack more. For earlier holders, it’s a test of patience they want their rewards to be worth more today (safe assumption). I get it. But when everything from road map development to institutional adoption (Tom Lee etc) is trending in the right direction, I honestly can’t find anything wrong with the current price action besides people getting annoyed simply due to learned behavior, boredom etc. 

There’s nothing else like Ethereum on this planet. This isn’t just a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity it might be a once-in-several-lifetimes opportunity.

TL;DR: Once you’ve scratched your trading itch and lived through a few cycles, stop trying to outsmart time. Focus on accumulating validators. That’s where we win.

**
One huge issue we have in crypto is how newbies are guided.**

X is full of scammers, YT as well, but newbies eventually gravitate there to get up to date information.

Every cycle we have new what I call ""smug cults"" and other narratives that suck in newbies and take their ETH to pay for VC and KOL lambos.

I've been in this market for a long time, I won the altcoin game in 17/18 and 20/21, swapped most of that to ETH and real estate and some stocks, really a diversified portfolio, now I am mostly chilling and buying dips because I believe in ETH. I also sometimes sell obvious tops, like last December.

So much about my background. Back to newbies. When I look at X, I feel disgust, but they feel conviction. When there's tons of people acting rich and signing every tweet with ""Hyperliquid."" they think this is the next big thing, truth does not matter, FDV for what it is does not matter either.

Solana, BNB scams, AI agents, perps, even NFTs to a degree (though still very ETH aligned back then), all of these are eternal liquidity drains on both BTC and ETH.

I onboard friends, they slowly learn from me, but always there is this inflection point where they buy some shitcoin that goes 5x. They get the gambling bug, they get smug, they think I am a washed boomer. And who am I to blame them, I played alts back in the day. But back then there was less of an industry designed to mislead and drain newbies.

I think the logic goes a bit like this. Crypto has kind of built this reputation of ""lol moon lambo doge meme"" culture instead of serious investments. Ethereum is one of the least degen trades in crypto, but people are here for massive upside and they are keen to find someone to tell them where they find that upside. So while people are always cautious upon entry, the second they make money they get bold and greedy.

I would need more hands to count the people that came in and held ETH and are now either in some other cult or got rekt and left calling it ""all a scam"".

How do you actually attract long term investors if you're Ethereum? Bitcoin does not have that problem, I know a lot of normies who just gradually DCA into Bitcoin, but they do not care about crypto at all aside from that.

I downloaded the JSON file from: [https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/transaction-fees](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/transaction-fees)

|:-|:-|
||
|2024|**1,171.09 BTC**|
|2025|**801.32 BTC** *(partial — through Oct 2025)*|

There’s roughly one Bitcoin block every 10 minutes, or about 144 blocks per day. With the current block subsidy at 3.125 BTC, that works out to approximately 450 BTC per day or 164,250 BTC per year in newly issued Bitcoin.

For 2024, total transaction fees came to 1,171.09 BTC.

1,171.09 / 164,250 x 100 = 0.71%

Realistically, nobody knows what will happen in the next months. I can only see that ETH is being bought up heavily by DATs, ETF inflows increasing, political/regulatory tailwinds, technical upgrades.

1o8shbl,ethereum,nk0f3jl,cryptOwOcurrency,2025-10-17T19:04:05,"Sentiment check.

ETH was higher than the current price ($3800) from May 8 to May 14 2021 (6 days), October 19 to December 28 2021 (70 days), Mar 4 to Mar 14 2024 (10 days), periodically between December 4 and December 17 2024 (11 days), and since August 6 2025 (72 days).

If we discount the outlier (2021 investing mania due to stimmie checks and historic money printing) and discount the recent run (since everyone just now had a chance to de-risk if they wanted to), ETH has been above $3800 for 27 other days in its 10-year history.

While I believe the price should be much higher, the only people not in profit are people who bought either just now in the past couple months, at the peak of 2021 mania, or during those 27 other scattered days. If you staked that whole time, you're offsetting USD inflation too somewhat.

So let's not pretend that $3800 is some terrible bankrupting loss. Lift that sentiment up! The price isn't where we want it to be right now, but we'll be mooning before you know it.

1oh5v66,ethereum,nlo1s34,growthepie_eth,2025-10-27T16:54:58,"(Thinking of doing weekly reports/updates - turned out quite long, so very open to feedback)

growthepie Weekly Summary (October 20-26, 2025)  
Last week, the Ethereum Ecosystem demonstrated significant progress in scalability, adoption, and community engagement.

Scalability and Performance Insights

* Recently Ethereum Ecosystem Transaction Per Second: Reached an all-time high of 3,100 TPS, up from 2,835 TPS, driven by Base (1,716 TPS), Arbitrum (1,201 TPS), and other Layer 2 solutions. Projections highlighted in our quick bite article indicate potential growth to over 10,000 TPS on Ethereum mainnet and over 1 million TPS within the Ethereum Ecosystem.
* Analysing the impacts of Base lower gas targets (33% vs. 50%) increased monthly transactions by 20% (300M to 360M), though active addresses decreased from 30M to 16M. DeFi transactions grew, and NFT activity rose, suggesting a shift toward organic user engagement.
* World Chain Active Addresses: Surged to a record 120,000 (+58% daily), fueled by Polymarket’s mini-app launch. We will be updating this metric to include user operations, this figure is currently under-reported.

Adoption Metrics

* Ethereum Stablecoin Supply: Grew to $173 billion, a $5.5 billion weekly increase (+96% year-over-year), with mainnet leading adoption, bolstered by its consistent uptime.
* Starknet Stablecoin Growth: Reached $140 million, a 63% increase in 30 days.
* Superform Transaction Growth: Recorded a 1,000% increase in weekly transactions (10,000) and a 258% rise in active addresses (2,800), primarily on Arbitrum One.
* Robinhood Tokenized Stocks: Tracked 489 stocks with $8 million in onchain value, showing steady inflows and growing interest in real-world assets (RWAs).
* Shopify on Base: Maintained consistent daily volumes via the Commerce Payment Protocol, signaling Web3 integration in e-commerce (search “Shopify” on our platform for details).
* a16z State of Crypto Report: Highlighted crypto’s maturation, faster chains, and DeFi mainstreaming, with our data featured prominently.

Community and Ecosystem Discussions

* Polygon PoS Classification: A community poll showed two-thirds support for including Polygon PoS in the Ethereum ecosystem. Our founder emphasized open dialogue with Polygon, with internal discussions on improving classification. (Noting that on reddit less people were in favour)
* GG24 Interop Round: With less than two days remaining, over $100,000 in matching funds support open standards and infrastructure.
* Octant Epoch 9: Top donors supported projects include ZachXBT and TheRageTech.

Additional Notes

* Jovay Network by Alipay: TPS tracking is live.
* Ethereum Reliability: Maintains 100% uptime (for over a decade) despite outages on AWS.
* Branding Note: Our platform is styled as “growthepie” (lowercase). Access our guide via right-clicking our logo.",40,False,,t3_1oh5v66,0

Solana representatives go on to declare that ""cutting the fat"" is net positive for the chain, and kicking them (through a Discord message lmao)

Sure, your already heavily centralized validator set is shrinking further, economic viability is no longer there unless SOL does 100% YoY, and apparently centralizing further is the way to go.

This is like the Bitcoin mining competition theory but weirdly applied to PoH/PoS.

First the genesis had to be redone due to a configuration error, and the pectra upgrade issues in spring made the network unusable for the intended purpose of testing staking setups.

I wrote that it looked suspicious to me because Solana is unstable (cancelled transactions when the TPS approaches its maximum, hours long outages every second year) and unsustainable (the number of validators (that are centralised around the Foundation) keeps dropping because they are unprofitable (the hardware, bandwidth and electricity cost millions per year while the net yield (counting unlocks) is around –10%/year)).

Today the Ethereum L2 teams gave the explanation for the strange choice of Western Union: Western Union wanted the experimental phase to be financed by the network. Solana offered a bigger check ($50M):

https://x.com/camillionaire_m/status/1983506060343185571

**In 6 months, after the experimental phase, Western Union will be free to use an Ethereum L2.**

Once again, Solana had to buy the appearant relevancy of their shaky product. Reminder:

- SOL DATs have been sold discounted SOL by the foundation, which is basically paying companies to accept to buy SOL,
- dying company Sorare got bribed $10M by the foundation last month to move to Solana,
- Kraken got paid the same way to launch their stocks on Solana before their own Ethereum L2 a few months later,

Peanut dot me (confirm using Twitter) lets you install as a chromium app and a very simple sign up. You have to KYC with an identity document, took about two minutes.

Then they assign you a contract address. You send USDC on arb and it appears as USDC in your peanut wallet.  Your funds remain in USDC and transactions are shown in pesos and USD.

You can withdraw that USDC at any time.

A lot of places let you pay using a QR code, using Mercado Pago or MODO. Everyone that I've tried so far has worked with the Peanut app.
 
Usually, they generate a QR code for you. You scan it in the app and then confirm the transaction. The transaction is in pesos but you see the conversion rate and the full amount in USD. Then the transaction is debited from your wallet. You get a transaction link for more information but there's nothing on chain.

In other instances, the shop has a static QR code. You scan that and you have a zero value transaction where you have to put in the correct amount. Confirm that and the vendor in some way gets a confirmation that you paid the correct amount. 

It's all very easy and straight forward. 

Note that you have to have internet access for it to work. I tried to top up my subway card but the moment I went underground, I lost connectivity.


So far I've been very happy with the simplicity. Right now they require an invite but you can find one easily enough on Twitter or use mine in hopes that I get perks (invite is downthread or dm me).",16,False,,t3_1oivv23,0

Lemon Cash and Belo require national identity number from a South American country, so that's ou. Ripio lists six countries, including Mexico and USA, which said ""residents and non-residents"". I started their KYC which accepted my Euro-credentials but the next step required a W8BEN, and as I really don't feel like talking to the IRS at this time, I opted out.   

The clear winner was Peanut App, not restricted by residence (in fact, I don't think it asked for any residential info at all) and a very straight forward KYC based on identity document of various types. I was approved within a few minutes and able to send USDC on Arb which I immediately spent on a croissant at a coffee shop. Many(most?) places here accept QR payments through MercadoPago and Modo and you seem to be able to pay at Peanut with any of them.   

It's not quite the decentralised option I was hoping for: all of these are custodial and require registration/KYC. It seems to me that although everyone is excited about stablecoin adoption in Argentina, it is all done through middlemen.   

I mean, no shade to Peanut, the app works great for paying here and I'm going to keep using it. But what I'm not seeing is a decentralised option, wallet to wallet, where I'm not having to ask permission to use the service and then send my money into a wallet that I don't hold the keys for.

1obb8mp,ethereum,nkftqnw,Moschus11,2025-10-20T07:21:10,"Yes! We’re back. Hello again $4,000 per ETH.

There was lot of whining about the price lately, so now is a good time to think rationally about what’s next.. and you’ve got two options.. 

Option one, you take the Red pill and sell (some).

Yeah, why not. We’re basically in all-time-high territory again. ETH hasn’t spent more than about 100 days above $4000 in it’s 10 year existence.  If you’ve been around long enough (for me that means more than two full cycles measured bottom to bottom), it’s more than fair to start thinking about taking some chips off the table. 

But no need to go all-out, maybe start DCA’ing out 10%, 20%, 30% of your stack over the next few months. That way, if we keep running, you keep on selling higher. If we retrace, you locked in some of those sweet sweet gains.

Or, option two, you take the blue pill and hold (and maybe even add a little if you’ve got dry powder left).

ETH never moves in straight lines. First it crabs. Long stretches of sideways action, then sloping down into seemingly nothingness. That’s the refuelling phase. The part where conviction gets tested and week hands get shaken out.

And then.. it explodes. Those face-melting, dopamine-spiking, screen-refresh-every-five-minutes kind of moves. The ones that - unfortunately - are over before you even realize what’s happening.

Arguably, we had (a rather mild) one this summer. We did a 2.5x from the bottom in nine weekly candles. Further back we’ve seen 5x, 8x, even 10x bursts. Same rhythm every time: long, boring compression, then violent expansion.

So yeah, it could happen again. Tom Lee says so. You could argue we’ve been coiling since 2021. Fundamentals seem again ahead of price, the charts look good, weekly RSI has cooled off around 50.

So stop whining and take the.. red pill or blue pill?",19,False,,t3_1obb8mp,0

Predicting market direction or timing price swings isn’t the only way to succeed. I follow a trading strategy that completely removes the need for forecasts or emotional decision-making.

Instead of worrying about whether the market will rise or fall, this approach lets you accumulate more shares automatically whenever the price returns to specific value zones. In simple terms when the market dips, you actually *gain* more exposure to accumulate coins ,sell them at higher prices, rather than panic-selling.

Over time, this method turns volatility from a threat into an ally. There’s no guessing, no rushing to catch trends, and no stress over daily news. You just follow the structure and let the system do its work buying more when prices are favorable and holding steady when they’re not.

The U.S. holds around 30% of the world’s wealth with only 4% of its population, meaning it is concentrated in a small fraction of hands.

When policies are announced that could harm economic growth, investor sentiment turns bearish, leading to selloffs and a drop in the stock market.

Having a paper/hardware wallet will be uncommon, only a few nerds across the world will host their tokens by themselves. The reason: it is risky and inconvenient. For the same reason, nearly nobody nowadays runs their own email server although this is how the free internet was designed.

Instead, all banks will host your tokens in a section of your account the same way they host your euros, dollars, stock shares in different sections already. More convenient than taking care of crypotographic keys with the fear of losing everything by mistake: all you need is a fingerprint to access your bank app and a SMS to confirm transfers.

Ethereum will not replace traditional transaction networks, it will exist as an additional option. For example, nowadays in Europe, to send money from our bank account, we / the bank choose between SEPA, Swift, and even sometimes a national network (example: MB Way in Portugal).

Ethereum, DeFi and all apps will all exist as they do now but instead of using wallet extensions like Metamask on various websites that you bookmarked, you will simply have a collection of safe apps selected by your bank accessible _from_ your account.

Ethereum will be an infrastructure between banks that clients can use from their accounts, just existing as an option besides the legacy infrastructure, and only some nerds will use it directly without the help of their bank.

I solved this by putting everything in institutional multisig and not looking at it.  I won't use the coin so it doesn't matter what the value is.  What matters is setting up the framework so my children can access it if they need.

But more to your point, what exactly is the goal?  I'm not super interested in raising lazy trust fund babies.  

My thought is to make it out more like a family bank.  Bitcoin is pristine reserve capital.  That means as the financial instruments develop we will be able to leverage it against housing, college education, things like that.  Right now the options are limited (10% loans are practically criminal IMO, especially when you can move it into an ETF as an in-kind contribution and use margin loans at 6%). As we go on, the financial instrumentation will improve. 

If you've managed to secure even a single Bitcoin, I suspect as the price climbs another 10-100x over the next 1-2 decades, that access to this kind of capital will pave a very simple path through whatever financial maelstrom might greet us in fiat land. And a solid foundation for family and grandchildren.

I'm learning how the insular Jewish community in Lakewood NJ uses interlocking trusts and political lockdown to secure vitality and support for their huge and growing family.  Whether you agree with their socio religious model or not, the legal structures they have built are worth paying attention.

Bitcoin is hard sound money that cant be inflated and it can be sent around the world instantly.

I used to have some other investments. I have been involved in bitcoin for over a decade. Do the math... I did, which is why I no longer have other investments outside of btc.

You may be able to retire relatively comfortable for 10 years or so but you will not create real wealth.

He convinced his business partner to ditch the produce business and go all in on oil which at the time was extremely volatile like crypto but John could see it was the future so he went all in.

The answer that was provided was this  
\`\`\`

The query references ""EIP-291032,"" but the provided context primarily discusses EIP-2929 and EIP-2930 around the time they went live with the Berlin upgrade \[3\].

**EIP-2929** provides a way to adjust gas pricings for trie-dependent opcodes in a backwards-compatible manner to mitigate DoS vulnerabilities. This was achieved by raising costs only for trie accesses that had not been accessed previously in the current execution context, leading to only a sub-percent increase in net costs \[2, 3\]. EIP-2929 was developed alongside EIP-2930 \[3\].

**EIP-2930** is a companion EIP to EIP-2929 that allows callers to specify and pre-pay for certain storage slots that will be accessed later during execution. By charging this cost upfront, it makes the increased cost from EIP-2929 un-noticeable during execution \[2\].

Other EIPs mentioned that relate to gas costs or state access include:

* **EIP-1884** (activated in Istanbul) which unconditionally raised costs for SLOAD, BALANCE, and EXTCODEHASH due to trie access costs \[9\].
* **EIP-150** (activated in Tangerine Whistle) which aggressively raised certain gas costs to protect against DoS attacks known as the ""Shanghai attacks"" \[9\].

Given the context provided, there is no specific information detailed for an EIP numbered **291032**.

There is no intrinsic value behind Solana, nor is there any store of value even remotely similar to Bitcoin. There is no fixed supply. There is no scarcity. This is most evidenced by the absolute collapse of the coin’s market cap after every bull run it has ever had in the past 4 years. 

In Bloomberg’s own words, “Solana is a breeding ground for pump and dump meme coin cabals”. No serious person is ever going to do business on such a chain.

Which has a huge advantage over account model by being deterministic and parallelizable, which can be better than concurrency. Everything is being built from scratch, because it's the first chain building things this way. It actually needs to be developed instead of copying something that already exists.

For example, one cool thing that is about to come out is DeFi actually built to leverage the full potential of Cardano's structure:

DeFi is not that good yet on Cardano because the DEXes are just translations of LPs from the account model, which is very inappropriate for an eUTxO model like Cardano. Since eUTxO is deterministic instead of concurrent, it requires batchers to make LPs work, who take pretty hefty fees to just ensure your swap will happen. The right way is the upcoming p2p order book DeFi, the correct way to do DeFi on eUTxO, which will turn the user's transactions themselves into limit and market orders interconnection all the liquidity into a blockchain wide order book. And then you can do some real magic that is so much better than what LP can do. You could make 100 swaps in a single transaction, in a parallelizable way, and with NO BATCHERS, meaning also no batcher fees. And since the tokens are native, transacting them is as cheap and simple and safe as just sending ADA itself (unlike the ERC kind of tokens). P2P eUTxO DeFi could become the most powerful and cheapest to use form of DeFi in the ecosystem (the opposite of what it's now with these batching LPs), and most deterministic, with the least possibilities to fuck your swap over like making it fail or front run it, or having to connect the wallet to some shady dApp (as p2p it would work directly on chain right inside your wallet). The orders will be happening right between the wallets of the two parties that are trading, no coins would even be held somewhere outside your wallet, even multistaged swaps could be atomic. And all the limit order liquidity you might offer would still be inside your wallet, you could even keep staking it in your own custody while offering it as liquidity. That could attract a lot more liquidity than noncustodial LPs.

Such a kind of DeFi just sounds too perfect. And that's just one example of how well thought out a single feature on Cardano can be, everything else follows similar patterns, like Cardano already has the best implementation of staking in the ecosystem, being simple, custodial, not locking, not slashing, and having extremely decentralizing mechanics making it have a ton of independent stake pools.

It's full of tech that REALLY puts the user first. And the cogs are still being put into the place to create a masterpiece of an engine.

As a DeFi focused person, the main things I cared about were DeFi liquidity, stables, scalability (fast & cheap), open source, truly permissionless DeFi, and the chain being sufficiently decentralized. In 2021/2022, I gave Cardano the benefit of the doubt since its DeFi was young. After some years though, I started to become disillusioned with Cardano since things didn't change (still had lower liquidity/stables, relatively slow and expensive, and the main ""dApps"" were still closed source and used centralized batchers and oracles), or if they did, it was mediocre at best. So I starting using other chains.

They were faster (in both time to inclusion and finality), cheaper (a few cents at most, usually less), had orders of magnitudes more in stables and had more overall liquidity, and, most importantly, had DeFi that was open source and actually permissionless. Some of these chains I considered ""sufficiently"" decentralized as well.

Cardano prides itself on correctness, peer-review, methodical approach to R&D, UTxO, functional programming, etc. Most of that is great, but at some point being way too theortical and way less practical (as well as the constant ""soon"", ""it's coming"", ""will be"", ""still in development"", ""about to come"") starts to become old, and not just to me, but to many people in crypto. Theory is important, but it alone doesn't mean anything if nothing is delivered and users are left constantly waiting or just unsatisfied. Cardano did not learn that lesson, and I'm not sure it ever will.

I moved on from Cardano and sold my ADA. Many others have as well. Some may not come back, even if Cardano changes. I'll still keep an open mind towards Cardano, but I won't hold my breath.",3,False,,t3_1offh3e,0

Legit meme coins like toshi, turbo, pengu that are on big exchanges are safer (still a risk) but not a super high chance of getting rugged like you would if they are not listed on good exchanges. I believe places like Coinbase vet these projects for red flags before listing them. My personal rule of thumb is only to get meme coins that are listed on coinbase.

I would have preferred Ledn or Strike, all else equal). As you said, compared to prior loan processes I've been through (mortgage, HELOC that we didn't end up using), it was just ridiculously simple and fast. Bitcoin as collateral is so clean, and you bypass the process of your entire financial life being dissected, which is never pleasant even if you have perfect credit.

I took out a very small loan, mainly as an experiment, and to get a better feel for how this works. The tiny amount of interest is worthwhile as tuition. I will use it pay some living expenses and use the excess liquidity to bump my DCA rate. I went with a 30% LTV, so liquidation price is \~$40k, and there's plenty of Bitcoin in the unlikely event I need to add collateral.

Anyway, thanks for going through this. It seems there's a lot of kneejerk negativity toward anything related to loans or leverage with Bitcoin. There is a massive difference between depositing Bitcoin to earn yield, going leveraged long, and what you outline here. It's basically a HELOC, but easier and with Bitcoin.

-- When greed dominates, Bitcoin reflects mania.

-- When fear dominates, Bitcoin reflects panic.

Even a country like Kazakhstan is looking to do something similar, can you imagine what it will be like when this happens collectively on the global level?

Another question is if the U.S government decides to back the $ with Bitcoin and other commodities, which is actually something that has been openly discussed on the political stage.

Many people here barely make ends meet, no matter how much state aid there is. And every year it feels like there are less people that are skilled enough to be economically independent from the government.

There is also less and less space, so housing options become harder, the new workforce lives in smaller rented rooms rather than a studio or bigger apartment.

I’m not part of the team but I’ve been in Hege a while so I’ll take a stab.

Personally I think people who hate memecoins already are not a good target, although I would say that Hege stands in the face of everything most memecoins are. Most memecoins are a fart in the wind, but Hege has built a real community of people who genuinely believe in it and ultimately have fun. 

Generally, for memecoins to succeed there does need be some backdrop of a good market, but the value of building something consistently during downturns is that a spark could set things off at any time, and also when the market does return that people have that trust already there and can see the track record and the brand.

Overall, memecoins are not an easy space to me in and can be fickle, but out of all memes out there it’s hard to deny Hege is one of the best out there, and one of the only authentic coins/communities. Even memecoin haters would have to admit that in my opinion ",13,False,,t1_nl8ci2e,1
1of4l3f,cryptocurrency,nlh447b,Flashy_Camera8109,2025-10-26T14:43:26,"Great questions!! 

I've been around the community and invested in Hege for a long time, so I'll also share my takes.

For Hege's target audience, my opinion is the biggest untouched potential is for people who haven't been involved in crypto yet as well as those already involved..
Honestly theres potential for people who dont like memes as well, as Hege has always been a part of the underdog story and trying to help all those out there succeed against the Hedgefunds and market manipulators out there by joining the Hege-fund, but I just think theres less potential in this area. 

Personally, Hege was one of the first coins I got involved with as a newbie in crypto, mainly due to the uniqueness of the story, the characters backgrounds, and the fun the community was having (regardless of the MC). I think its relatable to most normies, and during the next big retail push I think Hege has an excellent shot at gaining a LOT of new crypto investors. The team has constantly expanded the brand into merch, nfts, art, new memes, tiktok and YouTube shorts, games, etc.. all the key elements are in place and keeping Hege on everyones minds even in the weak market. During the next big retail push the team has lots of marketing funds in place to leverage all this content and really on board lots of new investors when the market really starts to push (with any luck Nov and Dec). And there's unlimited potential since the company owns the IP, think cartoons, movies, etc...

With the new DOA, it's also much easier for the investors to help steer the direction of Hege for many future cycles  to come. 

Those are just some of the reasons im super bullish on Hege and think lots of normies will be too.",5,False,,t1_nl8ci2e,1

Almost every indicator I look for a healthy project is present with Vechain.  
Just to name a few.

\- Active, frequent community engagement on twitter(spaces), including Sunny who drops in sometimes. Anyone can ask questions as long as you keep it civil.  
\- Clear roadmap at the start of the year, keeping every deadline and delivering.  
\- You can tell from their github activity that they clearly increased the amount of developer working on the project.  
\- Vebetter DAO with ever increasing dApps. These dApps mostly using AI to fact check and there are many bad actors and there are dApps which let you earn actual money from just picking up your dog poop(which you should be doing anyway) and get rewards for it.  
There was a post where a user thanked the developers because this paid for their dog treatment.  
You can earn money from drying your cloths on the sun and not using a dryer. Taking photos of your reusable mug. There is many more what you may find fun but overall and what matters for many is money. Casually(!!) using the app can get you $$$ monthly, yes you saw that right.  
\- Veword wallet login for dApps that made by vechain. Kinda like how facebook, gmail login works but for dApps which streamlines and takes the pain out of login.  
\- DEX with liquidity that allows moderate swaps between coins.  
\- Credit card that supports B3TR(afaik its called Stella pay). Less step to spend your crypto.  
\- Credit card(s) that support VET/ VTHO. Revolute and more credit card will start support this chain after the 2025 Q4 Hayabusa update.  
\- Vechain going full decentralized by end of this year!!! Anyone can become a validator without KYC.  
\- Mentioned before, metamask support and every goodies that comes with having proper multichain DEX support. Metamask got a credit card too I believe.  
2020 finally said hi to Vechain, better late than never.

These are just the things I remember without thinking much about it.

It will be bad when every coin goes up but vechain a.k.a not rising with the tide. This never happened so far.  
It will be bad if vechain is only rising with the tide and not gaining momentum. This never happened either.  
Whenever the bull market for alt started, Vechain was pulling ahead of others.

Last bullrun Vechain went even lower than now. Bloodbath is a gentle word to describe how bad it was YET vechain ended up being top 15 on CMC after a crazy run.

>Before SIMD-0096, Solana operated under a system where 50% of priority fees were burned, and the remaining 50% was allocated to validators [1]. Priority fees are optional fees paid by users to prioritize their transactions, ensuring faster processing during network congestion. However, this 50/50 split created an incentive problem. Transaction submitters could potentially engage in ""side deals"" with block producers, offering a larger share of the priority fee directly to ensure prompt transaction processing. This undermined the transparency of the fee structure and incentivized validators to prioritize these private arrangements over the network's overall health and security [3].

A liquidity crunch means there's a chance that we get cascading defaults - eg Peter can't pay Paul who can't pay Mary etc etc, everyone comes up short on bills and has to sell off some assets to meet immediate demands.

Vitalik writing about it just brings more attention to techniques that researchers already knew about. The improvements are real but incremental, not revolutionary.

The main benefit of GKR over SNARKs is you don't need a trusted setup ceremony. That's useful but it comes with tradeoffs in proof size and verification time. For most practical applications SNARKs or STARKs are still faster overall even with the setup overhead.

Our clients building ZK systems care more about prover time than verification speed because generating proofs is the bottleneck. If GKR makes proving faster for specific types of computations that's valuable, but it's not replacing existing ZK tech across the board.

The scalability claims depend heavily on the specific computation being proven. GKR works great for certain circuit structures but performs worse than alternatives for others. It's another tool in the toolbox, not a universal solution.

Most of the ZK performance improvements lately come from better hardware acceleration and optimized implementations, not fundamental protocol changes. Getting existing protocols running on GPUs or FPGAs matters more than switching to GKR for most use cases.

This research is just an extension of that. In order to scale these systems to the world, you need to find clever ways of making consensus more efficient, and that's where these zk proving systems come into play. The holy grail is being able to prove an Ethereum block fastener than the Ethereum block time (which is ~12s). If you can do this, then every single validator on the network can easily verify that the block was executed properly and according to the network rules. So they don't have to actually keep a copy of the block itself, they just need to store the proof. This makes validation incredibly efficient, and reduces the node requirements considerably. So now you can have a subset of validators responsible for generating computationally expensive proofs, and the large majority just verifying (through math and cryptography) that the blocks are correct. This is how Ethereum scales without compromising on decentralization. In fact, this would increase distribution of nodes and would make the network much more resilient.",11,False,,t1_nl2frfj,1

Everybody kneejerking about ""legal threats"" are only fueling support for this half-baked proposal. There are no threats. There's a claim that a blameless node operator could be exposed to criminal charges  

The supposed ""legal issue"" is that the node network is a volunteer operation. Every node operator is independent, and every node contains a copy (or part-copy for a pruned node) of the Bitcoin blockchain. In the early days of Bitcoin, there were discussions about whether every node operator is guilty of possessing and distributing unlawful content if one or more Bitcoin transactions embeds such content. In those old discussion threads, the consensus opinion was that the node operator is not liable  

The proposal can't work. It's not going to be implemented. Publicly shouting lame misconceptions about the proposal's justifications is pointless  

Logic  

If a Bitcoin node operator might be liable for unlawful material  on his copy of the blockchain, and if it's necessary to change Bitcoin to eliminate this risk, then the change must completely prevent the storage of unlawful material  

The BIP444 proposal does not prevent the storage of unlawful material. It's a ""we gotta be seen to be doing something"" proposal which tweaks a couple of Bitcoin script opcodes and parameters. The tweaks only invalidate one current method of storing arbitrary data in a txinput scriptSig, and impose a consensus limit on the OP_RETURN txoutput  

The obvious indication that the proposal is a failure is that it's proposed to have a 12-month expiry - supposedly to give us enough time to work out a proper solution. We've seen arbitrary data on the Bitcoin blockchain for many years. The proper solution isn't a couple of hopeful parameter tweaks.

But the data is stored immutably. This is a kindness to the node operators - not straining the node's memory by loading it with arbitrary data  
https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions.html  

But there are other methods which have been used for years  

For example, there's a Simpsons JPEG in transaction 94e319d09fc236fb9d7a24e60af8f47ed41ca3cc01e9950c925d806153ed8aa3  

The Simpsons JPEG in 2017 uses a repeating sequence of OP_PUSH, 520 bytes, OP_DROP. Unlike Ordinals, these opcodes are executed in the node, although they only occupy 520 bytes of memory at a time (thanks to the OP_DROP)  

The OP_DROP method and several other methods are discussed in this 2018 paper  
https://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/ledger/article/view/101  

Bitcoin script has a rich set of opcodes  
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script  

The BIP444 proposal can't hope to predict all possible uses of Script for arbitrary data insertion, so it chooses a couple of known methods, ignores other known methods, and isn't aware of unknown methods which will be chosen to bypass its filters",2,False,,t1_nlmsykx,2

Bitcoin only links each txinput back to the txoutput it is spending. This link is the main component of Satoshi's double-spend prevention. There is no multi-step trace, neither forward nor backward

> The CSAM thing they keep bringing up

They lost the argument about the recent relay policy rule modification to remove limits on OP_RETURN txoutputs. In consensus rules (what's permitted on the blockchain), there has never been a limit. There are now mining pools who offer a service - if you can't relay your transaction, send it to us to bypass the mempool relay process. This effectively makes some relay policy rules obsolete, so they were removed  

The opposition to that change was that it would bloat the chain with spam. Having lost the argument, they're now proposing to reimpose the 80-byte limit as a consensus rule. And having lost the spam argument, they're resorting to moral outrage. It's a very cheap argument, and a slippery slope  

The CSAM thing has a Bitcoin history going back years. There were long debates on Reddit and bitcointalk. A few years later there was a hostile PR campaign sponsored by anti-Bitcoin members of US Congress. They paid their PR consultants to fly a few kites

* unlawful content - eg state secrets or child pornography
* drug dealers and money laundering
* electricity consumption and carbon emissions

Only the electricity consumption issue had any effect on public opinion. So the other issues were shelved  

For Bitcoin insiders to be abusing the unlawful content issue now is a cheap stunt. Maybe they'll move public opinion, not in favor of their half-baked tweaking proposal, but against Bitcoin

Polygon CEO Sandeep Nailwal echoed frustrations, questioning the Foundation's approach and lack of official recognition for Polygon as a Layer-2 network. Vitalik Buterin acknowledged Polygon's role in the ecosystem.

Despite this, total Bitcoin holdings by non-mining companies have risen to 865,350 BTC, valued at $95.85 billion. Factors influencing the slowdown include profit-taking, tighter budgets, regulatory scrutiny, and a shift toward alternative assets like Ethereum and yield-bearing cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin ETFs are absorbing capital, reflecting a maturing market where companies integrate Bitcoin more strategically into treasury management.

Long-time holders are selling at 100k or above, then tighten up supply if it goes too far below, and sell more if it hits ATH. 100k is a big psychological number for long-time HODLers.

But the more they sell the higher the cost basis for the average Bitcoin, meaning eventually that sell-pressure drains away, leading to new supports.

The truth is there are way way more people with a huge amount of conviction who feel they missed out and want to be whole-coiners, and that number will never drain away, it will only grow as Bitcoin becomes more mature, more lindy.

My guess is that the private equity collapse will result in a credit tightening, as banks freeze up without collateral, solidifying the narrative of Bitcoin as pristine collateral. In the US within 5 years people will be putting up Bitcoin as loan collateral, along with the assets they are purchasing (e.g. real estate, equity in a company), thereby over-collateralising their debt and reducing interest rates. This is the ultimate Bitcoin Treasury company play, because banks don't have the industrial relationships and competencies to lend to businesses anymore, and will need collateral partners embedded in the real economy in order to continue doing business. Collateral partners will provide industry expertise and experience and pristine collateral to lubricate debt markets, and take a slice of the interest.

In the case of Strategy this industry expertise is in tech and VC. But there are Bitcoin treasury companies popping up in all kinds of random industries and it seems like it makes no sense until you understand that US treasuries are no longer pristine collateral, they are struggling to sell them at lower rates, meaning there is a gap to be filled. Gold is also excellent collateral, but in a digital world with extremely fast-moving markets it can't be liquidated easily across national borders.

1of1nbn,bitcoin,nlj3xo6,TripsterX,2025-10-26T20:47:37,"Okay so for a start, I will say i am by no means a knownitnall with bitcoin. There is alot I still need to brush up on, but honestly with bitcoin knowledge is power. Educate yourself on the economy, macro economics. 

Spend time studying bitcoin so you understand thoroughly what it is you whare investing is. The mistake alot of people in is investing in something they dont understand. This means that as soon as a 30% drop comes, they panic, whereas if you have thorough belief in what you invest in, youll see that dip as a major opportunity, and instead of dread and regret, youll use it as a shot at further improving you position for long term success. Its that exact robustness and commitment to bitcoin which is essential to long term wealth building.

In terms of my bitcoin journey, I placed about 800 USD in back when bitcoin was around 27k USD per BTC. Left that for about a couple of years which became about 3700USD. This initial gain is what sent me onto my investment journey. 

Like I mentioned, I worked hard through the summer and made about 6k GBP (approx 8k USD). This was inititially intended for a car, but instead took a leap and lumped all of that into BTC when it was about 55k per BTC. With btc now being at 113k, that investment has already well paid off, but now, after self educating about btc, I realise that im not withdrawing that until im well into my 40s atleast. Im currently 25 so will have about 20 years of time to allow it to do its thing.

I now DCA (Dollar cost averaging) which is essentially investing a set amount every set time period, regardless of price. This helps to over time, negate alot of the wild price swings (up and down) that BTC will go through. Since my 6k lump sum, I now only DCA about 30 GBP per week. You can do as much or as little as you like.

I now store my BTC in a hardware wallet with my recovery phrases secure. I would recommend as you become more serious about BTC,  it means you are the sole owner of your BTC. When you store it on an exchange, its essentially them holding it going ""you own this"". Instead when you have yoir own hardware wallet, you have full controll over your btc, along with your keys being stored totally offline, away from hackers. That being said, with you beig the sole owner of your btc means any mistakes CAN lead to losses such as using incorrect wallet addresses, falling for dusting attacks, but aslong as you are vigilant, educate yourself and understand how it works and what its doing, and you check wallet addresses (which your hardware wallet will make you do anyway) you will be absolutely fine :))

In terms of how much btc to own, as soon as you have bought 0.0001 btc, youre ahead of 92% of the population, so well done!. Keep stacking bit by bit. The amount ofbl btc to own is subjective. Its different for everyone. I myself now hold about 0.17, and im very happy with that, but I know alot of people hold more, but alot of people hold less.

PeerDAS, a key feature, is expected to significantly scale Ethereum's layer-2 networks by enabling faster and cheaper transactions. Vitalik Buterin has called PeerDAS crucial for layer-2 scaling.

While SBF has filed an appeal, a pardon from Trump is seen as his only realistic chance for early release, though experts doubt its likelihood due to his political affiliations and the nature of his crimes.

The employee asked Xu for more information about the transaction and warned her that she was likely “being scammed,” according to the decision.

“I find that the defendant’s warnings to the plaintiff could not have been clearer,” LeBlanc’s decision reads.

After the phone call, Xu “sent a number of emails to the defendant demanding they proceed with the withdrawal without delay,” according to the decision.

“The plaintiff’s tone escalated to where she was threatening legal action against the defendant if they did not proceed.”

At that point, Xu received a second phone call, this time from a compliance officer from NDAX, who again warned that she might be being scammed and sought to confirm that she wanted to go through with the transaction anyway.

Hopefully privacy was solved *before* Bhutan put their national ID system on Ethereum :) How I understand, 2nd generation ""digital ID"" solves the privacy issues, but is more complicated. The ""dumb"" (1st generation) works like you (or me) would come up with yourself, the central server has all info, and anyone verifying an ID simply verifies it to the central server. The problem is the central server has complete surveillance of how ID is used (not a problem with paper ID but a problem with digital). This is part of why so many are ""digital ID will enslave us all!!!"" (and they are right, from a certain point of view, but missing another point of view). The 2nd generation solves this, by that the user has their info, the user then generates proofs that are specific for the key of the company that verifies the user. This proof includes a ""trapdoor"" such that the company cannot leak the user's information, since they could have generated it themselves, nothing proves the user's key was involved. I do not understand the cryptography of this, I do not even understand elliptic curve cryptography (I do know RSA.... but I am very dumb on advanced asymmetric cryptography). So with this 2nd generation you solve all privacy concerns, as I understand.

The internet in the 90s was full of scams and speculation too, but the infrastructure that came out of that era ended up changing everything.

Right now crypto still feels early and noisy, but there’s genuine innovation under the surface. Stablecoins already move billions daily across borders faster and cheaper than banks. Tokenisation of assets, on-chain identity, and decentralised infrastructure are all evolving fast, even if they’re not mainstream yet.

Most coins will die off, that’s true. But the core idea of programmable, censorship-resistant value transfer isn’t going away. Hype brings attention, and attention brings capital, which eventually funds real progress. It’s messy, but it’s how big shifts usually start.",0,False,,t3_1ofmeb4,0

Bitcoin functions as a monetary network, a store of value, and a decentralized settlement layer all in one. It’s less about competing with Visa and more about creating a censorship‑resistant, non‑sovereign financial system that operates without central intermediaries. The fact that you can built payment systems on top of it is just another aspect of Bitcoin, as programmable money (basic smart contract). It's far superior to other currencies in this aspect because they require external centralized systems (like Visa and MasterCard) to fulfill this role (which in turn gives them a lot of control...and we see them abuse it, censoring all kind of activities by banning them from their services).

Ethereum pushes this even further. Its utility goes well beyond trading as it enables smart contracts, DeFi, tokenized assets, games, and even on‑chain governance systems.

XRP 15%

BNB 10%

For most of my career I've been a TV producer making documentaries for the big networks here in the UK, but I left the industry to work independently and was on the look out for stories with my co-director, Louis.

Louis knew a little about crypto and had been working with Aave on some of their tutorial videos, then when he attended EthCC got talking to Michael Bentley, the British founder of Euler Finance. Euler had just been though a $200m hack where they and a team of whitehats had scared the hacker into returning all of the lost funds (I believe it happened the day after Michael's first baby was born). It seemed insane that a theft that large had occurred and nobody in the mainstream press was covering it - and then I looked deeper into DeFi hacks and saw that thefts on similar scales were happening regularly. That's what took us into the rabbit hole.

The Indexed Finance hack was one of the first that captured our imagination as the attacker's identity was uncovered and they defended their actions publicly - this was the first time we became aware of ""Code is Law"".

It wasn't until quite deep into our research and the first time I came across The DAO that the film as it is now started to take shape - with the ""Code is Law"" meme/ philosophy/ defence linking the huge hacks we cover.",5,True,,t1_njx5xe3,1

1nwqcsa,solana,nhx6pn1,ApeTown_,2025-10-05T18:07:47,"Just to add from personal experience, the “40%” headline is a really common trap for newer stakers; it refers to **validator commission**, not your yield. Always double-check that number before delegating.

One thing I’d also mention is that even when you stake with a “safe” validator, there are still a few risks that catch people off guard:

* Validators can **raise commissions suddenly**, and most people never notice.
* If they get **jailed or go offline**, your yield drops until you manually redelegate.
* Rewards often **aren’t auto-compounded**, so you lose a bit of efficiency over time.

After a few years of staking across different networks, I ended up using a system called **Polli** for my Cosmos delegations - it basically automates those things (tracks performance, redelegates underperforming validators, compounds automatically, etc.). They’ve been talking about launching on Solana before the end of the year, which I think could help simplify a lot of what’s being discussed here.

But in the meantime, for smaller amounts, I’d say treat this as a learning experiment. Stake with 1–2 smaller reputable validators using a wallet like Phantom or Backpack, and just get familiar with how rewards flow and compounding works. You’ll learn way more from doing it yourself than any guide can teach.",3,False,,t3_1nwqcsa,0

2) stake with a validator who is reputable. Some validators will advertise the 0% commission, then suddenly jack up the commission to 90% or 100% because they don't think you're paying attention.

* We assigned our 'B-' issuer credit rating to Strategy.

Here is my explanation on why stable coin offers an advantage:

Cash has to come from or through a bank.    Banks have rules and are often tied to country’s rules as well.  Once you have exchanged cash for stable coin it can be instantly transferred anywhere digitally without all those boundary rules.   Stable coin’s value should be stable since it is tied to a currency like the dollar.    So if you buy one coin for one dollar and the world turns upside down you still have one stable coin worth one dollar.    Even if that dollar is now worthless you still have one.    

Stable coin can be exchanged for digital assets instantly and without all the banking rules and country rules.     It can be done at anytime of day or any day of the week.

less friction was good because it allowed people to arbitrage away the small price differences between exchanges.

tether had this shitload of cash sitting around backing the stablecoin so they bought us treasuries with it. then a bunch of other people said hey that's pretty neat we get paid just to hold money, i'll buy that for a dollar. then government said, hey i like it when you buy my treasuries because those meanses chinese keep selling them. let's lock it in with legislation.

1ociy1s,cryptocurrency,nknnvw8,TheoryUnlikely_,2025-10-21T20:53:18,"1. Is it just dollars in crypto form? Yes.
2. Is it pointless? No. You need something to buy and sell crypto against. On an exchange like Coinbase or Binance, you can use regular money and let them deal with the technical details. Out on the chain, this is not possible. A stand-in for regular money is needed.
3. What does ""out on the chain"" mean? BTC the coin exists on the Bitcoin network. ETH the coin exists on the Ethereum network. SOL the coin exists on the Solana network. There are other things on these networks besides their namesake coin. Doing stuff with those ""other things"" is called on-chain activity. Such as DeFi and NFTs. Chain here is short for blockchain. The network is the thing that creates/stores(enables the existence of) the blockchain.

Short intro done. Can you really make ~~8-10%~~ money on stablecoins? If so, how?

Yes. By, in one way or another, funding on-chain activity aka selling shovels. If you get good at it, you can make a lot more than 8-10%.

How?... That's like asking what career should I pick. As a beginner, just go with Aave. Turn some real world money into USDC and get it into Aave on Arbitrum/Base/Polygon. You will learn enough by doing that to pick your own path forward.",12,False,,t3_1ociy1s,0
1ociy1s,cryptocurrency,nkn6x4e,Ok_Reputation9512,2025-10-21T19:34:56,"In short: currently, you can earn high yields from holding and staking. You're probably better off for risk to buy crypto that will match or beat that return, currently. In the next few years, (officially beginning 18 months from July 18, 2025, assumedly, when the stablecoin bill was signed) banks will begin custody of stablecoins and Bitcoin, Litecoin, Eth, and other cryptos. Once the banks hold stablecoins and other crypto, utility companies will begin accepting payment in crypto. Then average stores. That means you can hold Bitcoin and Litecoin at your bank, sell what you need for the week or month, buying stablecoins, and pay your bills. Or buy your groceries. You'll never need to hold real dollars. And the stablecoin issuer must have a 1:1 asset on the books, so banks can buy yielding treasury bonds to hold in order to issue stablecoin equivalents, and they can earn and allow you to stake to earn for what you're holding in stablecoins, probably more than a savings account, as they can use higher yield long term treasuries to get higher yields themselves. You might get 4%. The law says that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot pay a return on holdings, by say, staking. But there is a loophole that says another 3rd party can. It's a whole new layer of finance.
 You would think: I never use a real dollar? That sounds bad for the dollar, why do this? Because for every stablecoin issued, an equivalent monies must be held in lock up.

The foundation has the right to delegate to whoever they want with their SOL. Them being more selective to those who add value back into Solana is a net positive for SOL holders and the ecosystem.

The reason why the foundation is making this change is now the cost to run a validator is becoming super affordable relative to what it has been. Now anyone can run a validator without needing to pay an enormous amount of money each day just to exist. This is because a certain mechanic of the chain no longer needs to write everything it does on chain. This is amazing and opens validating up to anyone that has the hardware. Something that's not even that costly when you compare chains like Ethereum which require 32 ETH to run a validating node. The hardware is the smallest cost.

All in all, great changes are coming. Validator count will rise because the cost of running a validator is drastically lowering. However, some existing validators are upset because the foundation will no longer hand their votes to everyone just because they run a validator.

With account models you have to prove the entire current state of an account (balance, nonce, etc) and since that's constantly changing you end up with way more complex state management in your ZK circuits.

The bigger issue imo is the centralization risk with account models. Most ZK rollups using accounts (zkSync, StarkNet, etc) rely on centralized sequencers because account balances HAVE to update sequentially ). You can't process two txs from the same account without knowing the order. So whoever runs the sequencer can front-run, censor, extract MEV... basically defeats the whole point.

Privacy is also way better with UTXOs since they naturally break the input/output link. You can prove you're spending valid UTXOs without revealing which ones. Account models inherently tie everything to an address, so even with ZK you need extra layers to get similar privacy.

Our clients who work on custody solutions see this constantly, people store seed phrases in ways that seem secure but don't account for physical degradation over time.

Regular pen and paper isn't archival quality. Ink fades from light exposure, paper degrades from humidity, and stuff gets damaged in fires or floods. If you're storing significant value you need better materials than whatever notebook you had lying around.

Metal seed phrase backups exist for this exact reason. Companies like Billfodl or Cryptosteel let you stamp or arrange letters into stainless steel plates that won't degrade. They're fireproof, waterproof, and the letters don't fade. Costs like $50 to $100 which is nothing compared to potentially losing your crypto.

If you're going the paper route at least use archival quality paper and permanent ink designed for document preservation. Store it in a dark dry place, not sitting on your desk getting hit by sunlight. Multiple redundant copies in different locations help too in case one gets destroyed.

The brute forcing approach you mentioned does work for missing words but three is pushing it. The computational difficulty grows exponentially with each missing word. One word is trivial, two is manageable, three starts taking serious time depending on your hardware.

Your solution of using light and contrast enhancement is clever but most people won't have your image processing skills. Better to just store the damn thing properly from the start.",1,False,,t3_1oalw6m,0

Over $1 trillion has flowed into ETFs this year, particularly in gold and crypto. Regulatory changes are making it easier to include alternative assets in retirement plans and spot crypto ETFs. Experts advise caution, suggesting limited exposure to alternatives, as traditional investments like the S&P 500 remain reliable.

I’m not even logged into Google on mine; I strictly use it to interact with the Solana DApp Store. I’ve only got three apps installed: the main wallet (built with Solflare), Jupiter, and Marinade.

I fully agree with Mert’s point on X — they should drop the phone functionality entirely and make it a focused, high-end hardware wallet. That alone could shave a few hundred dollars off the price.

If you preordered early enough, the airdrop totals came out to around $150, and during the initial founder window it was closer to $450 — so in essence, you only paid about $300. Margins after that are probably razor thin. The last “airdrop bonanza” on the Saga was mostly thanks to Bonk, and I doubt we’ll see a repeat of that.

I do love the seed vault and seed ID, but given how Solana mobile has supply chain issues I’m a bit worried if I break or lose my phone. With my ledger I’d just buy a new one and not break the bank. 

Also I’m not sure if this is a majority opinion but as a very active DeFi and crypto user I don’t want standalone apps.

The Fed's end to QT has already been leaked to big bank strategists and the WSJ, they will cut at their next two meetings to stay consistent with September dot plot and market expectations, and they will continue to prioritize supporting growth while avoiding public acknowledgement that their inflation target has shifted up to ~3%.

Fast forward a few hours and Trump will be touting his meeting with Xi as the most successful and important meeting any US president has ever had. There will be talks of a grand deal made that can now provide certainty to corporates and consumers globally. After this, event risk rolls off significantly into year end.

It is extremely difficult to be fearful of a market boogeyman when corporate bond yields are at 3.5 year lows, mortgage rates are at 3 year lows, oil is at 4.5 year lows, the Fed is cutting in 4/5 consecutive meetings and ending QT, fiscal deficit spending is still running rampant and OBBA incentives plus other election year stimulus measures begin next quarter.

I wrote that it looked suspicious to me because Solana is unstable (cancelled transactions when the TPS approaches its maximum, hours long outages every second year) and unsustainable (the number of validators (that are centralised around the Foundation) keeps dropping because they are unprofitable (the hardware, bandwidth and electricity cost millions per year while the net yield (counting unlocks) is around –10%/year)).

Today the Ethereum L2 teams gave the explanation for the strange choice of Western Union: Western Union wanted the experimental phase to be financed by the network. Solana offered a bigger check ($50M):

https://x.com/camillionaire_m/status/1983506060343185571

**In 6 months, after the experimental phase, Western Union will be free to use an Ethereum L2.**

Once again, Solana had to buy the appearant relevancy of their shaky product. Reminder:

- SOL DATs have been sold discounted SOL by the foundation, which is basically paying companies to accept to buy SOL,
- dying company Sorare got bribed $10M by the foundation last month to move to Solana,
- Kraken got paid the same way to launch their stocks on Solana before their own Ethereum L2 a few months later,
- Now Western Union is paid by Solana in a new attempt to appear relevant... for 6 months.",3,False,,t3_1oir3x2,0
