No, our worst enemies are within this space with deep entrenched interests. They want to destroy your wealth, rather than to help you build wealth.

Biden's era also gave us a lot of anti crypto rulings:
2022 Executive Order on Digital Assets
SEC enforcement
, through regulators like the FDIC, has pressured banks to disengage from crypto-related businesses, limiting access to traditional financial services.
Tax reporting rules:
Mining tax proposal

Building this kind of technology is incredibly complex, and no one else is approaching it quite like Cardano. We can't just copy Ethereum, because they're the ones taking ideas from us.

Promises of when things would release like SC back in 2021 just had delay after delay. People are fatigued by that continuing to happen. The old slow and sure is putting people off because all that’s happening is cardano slips further and further behind in adoption stakes. The tech isn’t speaking for itself otherwise adoption would be greater. 

And Absolutley price is important because it’s a metric of how much faith people have in its future.
