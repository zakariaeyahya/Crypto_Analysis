My business partner recently passed away due to a long-progressed disease.

We were equally into trading options and futures: I was building tools and strategy while he was responsible for all the business stuff. For 2 years we were self sufficient, trading only with our net revenue.

My personal binance account now shows >1Bn USD in trading volume (+around 130m on other exchanges combined, all verifiable with KYC attached)

In early 2025 we manually gambled away all the earnings with dumb degenerate moves - maybe it was an act of despair.

cryptocurrency,1ojuslv,Universal Cross Margin — How Lighter Plans to Turn Every Ethereum Asset into Trading Collateral,aminok,2025-10-30T10:11:41,0,0.2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ojuslv/universal_cross_margin_how_lighter_plans_to_turn/,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ojuslv/universal_cross_margin_how_lighter_plans_to_turn/,"Lighter is introducing **Universal Cross Margin (UCM)** — a system that could make *any* Ethereum-based asset usable as margin collateral for perpetual trading. That includes ETH, stETH, LP tokens, Aave positions, or WBTC — not just stablecoins like USDC. The assets stay on Ethereum Layer 1, continuing to earn yield, while traders open and manage positions on Lighter’s Layer 2.

The key innovation here is that this cross-layer collateralization is **fully verifiable through zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs**, not bridges, oracles, or multisig custodians. Earlier systems couldn’t do this because ZK tech wasn’t mature enough to efficiently prove complex financial state changes (like order matching, margin calls, and liquidations) at scale. Lighter built custom ZK circuits and a specialized “Order Book Tree” that make it computationally feasible to verify every operation — including those involving collateral that never leaves Ethereum.

# How It Works

1. **Collateral stays on Ethereum (L1)** You lock ETH, stETH, LP tokens, or other supported assets into Lighter’s L1 smart contracts. They remain on Ethereum, keeping their native yield (e.g. stETH still earns staking rewards).
2. **Collateral is registered in the L2 state** Lighter’s rollup records the locked asset in its state tree so it can be used for trading margin. The L2 handles execution through a low-latency sequencer and proves every transaction with ZK circuits.
3. **Trading happens on L2** Orders are matched on a central-limit order book. You can trade any listed pair using the collateral value of your L1 assets. None of your assets move unless you’re liquidated.
4. **Liquidations and settlements are cryptographically enforced** If a position becomes under-collateralized, the L2 generates a ZK proof of the liquidation event. That proof is submitted to Lighter’s Ethereum contract, which verifies it and automatically releases only the required portion of the locked collateral. No human intervention, no trust assumptions.
5. **Full composability with DeFi** Because assets remain on Ethereum, they can still interact with the broader DeFi ecosystem — earning yield or being tokenized for use elsewhere. The same logic applies in reverse: DeFi positions can serve as margin on Lighter.

# Why It’s Different

Previous perpetual DEXs and L1 derivatives platforms faced trade-offs:

* **Bridges and oracles** introduced trust and delay (often hacked or manipulated).
* **Monolithic alt-L1s** like dYdX v4 or Hyperliquid had to rebuild their own ecosystems, isolating liquidity.
* **Optimistic rollups** could not liquidate in real time due to challenge periods.
* **ZK rollups** before now couldn’t efficiently prove multi-asset financial logic.

Lighter’s architecture removes these limits. Cross-margining multiple DeFi assets becomes **provably safe** — verifiable on Ethereum with no off-chain dependencies.

# Why It Matters

* **Capital efficiency:** traders can use yield-earning assets without selling or wrapping them.
* **Security:** all collateral and state roots are settled on Ethereum; nothing depends on a bridge.
* **Verifiability:** every trade, liquidation, and collateral adjustment is backed by a ZK proof.
* **Integration:** native composability with Ethereum means Lighter can plug into existing DeFi protocols instead of competing with them.

If it works as described, UCM could shift on-chain trading from isolated collateral systems to a **capital-agnostic model**, where any Ethereum asset can serve as trustless margin — something earlier generations of DeFi simply couldn’t do.

While bitcoin treasury companies, Trump family and big whales have been aggressively accumulating BTC over the counter (OTC). The OTC balances have dropped to around 150k bitcoin, and the exchange balances are still dropping. The market is trying to flush out short term holders.

But those who believe in bitcoin as digital gold, the perfect hard asset - - will never sell. And that's what Blackrock, and others have been advising their wealthy clients. With talks of AI bubble rising, short term investors are fearful of investing in bitcoin as they consider it a risk on asset. For bitcoin to really start its bull run, it needs to behave like gold. Institutional capital and retail capital needs to flow into bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and money printing. That is when it will finally decouple with the NASDAQ. Until then, the bull run won't start. 

Edit: I expect most people to disagree with me. Only the ones who truly believe that bitcoin is the hardest asset will agree (one of the first ones to do so was Michael Saylor). Before ridiculing me ask yourselves -- are public companies adding so much exposure to bitcoin because they think it's a ""risk on"" asset? Just follow the smart money.

Btc dropped to about $109k during Powell’s speech, and roughly $300 billion was wiped from the overall crypto market over the following day.

But but but...... Btc bounced back pretty quickly and is now sitting around $111k...$112k. Powell said a december rate cut isn’t guaranted, which spooked traders at first, but overall the msg wasn’t that bad.

The Fed also confirmed it will halt its balance sheet reduction starting December 1. that’s actually a bigger deal than most realize because it means liquidity will gradually start returning to the system. not right away… but the direction is turning supportive.

Now for november... there are some solid reasons for optimism. big tech earnings are dropping this week, and if they come in strong, they usually lift risk assets, including crypto. Plus, upcoming talks between Trump and Xi Jinping could help cool trade tensions a bit.

also ,Michael Saylor recently reiterated his long term bullish outlook…. whether that happens or not, sentiment among large investors has clearly turned positive.

What makes this dip different is that big holders... the whales... have been buying, not selling. On chain data shows wallets holding 10k...100k BTC accumulated more than 45,000 coins since the October crash. That’s not panic... that’s confidence.

Technically, btc might retest around $110k to close some small futures gaps... pretty normal behavior. Historically, btc often dips right after Fed meetings... then recovers within days or weeks to make new highs.

bottom line is short term volatility’s still possible, but the setup looks much stronger than it did a month ago. Lower rates, the Fed easing up on tightening, and institutional buying all point in a constructive direction... as we have seen so many times ,just don’t expect it to be a straight line up.",ANALYSIS,True,,False

We’re excited to share that $MOONs are now available on Teller, a decentralized lending protocol that lets you earn 22% compounding yield directly in MOON — with no lockups, no impermanent loss, and full control over your tokens.

Deposit your MOON here: [https://app.teller.org/arbitrum-one/earn/](https://app.teller.org/arbitrum-one/earn/)  
Read the full Teller blog: [https://blog.teller.org/earn-22-compounding-yield-on-moon/](https://blog.teller.org/earn-22-compounding-yield-on-moon/)

# What this means for the community

MOONs have officially joined Teller’s Arbitrum pools, which means:

* You can now stake MOON to earn more MOON automatically
* 22% APY per block, compounding continuously
* Withdraw anytime — no lockups or hidden mechanics
* No impermanent loss — single-asset lending, not a liquidity pool

Teller is currently bootstrapping their Arbitrum launch with this 22% base incentive. As borrowing activity grows, APYs can rise even higher (up to \~60%), driven directly by borrower repayments.

For context, Teller operates differently from traditional DeFi lending platforms. There are no price-based liquidations — loans roll over every 30 days, and lenders earn from interest and incentive rewards on a per-pool basis.

# About Teller

Teller has been gaining traction as a no-liquidation lending protocol live across multiple chains (Base, Polygon, Katana, Arbitrum, Ethereum).  
They previously hosted an AMA here in r/CryptoCurrency introducing their protocol — you can check it out for background:  
**Teller’s previous AMA:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lip4c1/introducing\_teller\_earn\_30\_apy\_on\_bitcoin\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1lip4c1/introducing_teller_earn_30_apy_on_bitcoin_and/)

# Teller AMA Tomorrow

Teller will be hosting a new AMA tomorrow right here on r/CryptoCurrency to answer community questions about the MOON integration, their no-liquidation lending model, and how this fits into the broader DeFi ecosystem.

If you’ve been looking for new productive use cases for MOON, or just want to earn yield without leaving Arbitrum, this is a great chance to learn more and ask questions directly.

That means it is time to buy, because everyone says buy the dip. But when you buy the dip it dips more, which means that was not the real dip, that was the fake dip before the real dip. So you wait for the real dip, but since you wait, it goes up, and you think yes now it is recovering, so you buy again. But the moment you buy, it dips again, which makes sense because the market waits for you. So you think maybe that was the fake fake dip and the next one is the real dip, so you hold, but then it keeps dipping, so you sell because you think it will crash more. But after you sell, it goes up, because it always goes up when you sell. Then you think ok this time I will not fall for it, I will wait for confirmation. So you wait for it to go up a little to confirm, but when it does, you buy again because that means it is safe now, and then it drops again because the confirmation was the trap. Then you say ok I learned now, I will only buy when it feels wrong. But when it feels wrong, it keeps feeling wrong, so you do not buy, and then it goes up. Then you say ok now it is going up too fast, it must correct, so you wait, but it keeps going up, so you FOMO buy, and then it crashes again. Then you tell yourself it is just market manipulation, whales pushing you out, but deep down you know the whales just follow you. Every time you buy, they sell, every time you sell, they buy. So the best time to buy is when you don't buy, while you buy when you don't. I hope this information has been helpful to you.",STRATEGY,True,,False

Please don't give me hate. Pretty low right now.

I heavily invested into an alt coin (my posts history makes clear which) a few years ago with the typical belief that it was solving a real world problem and would continue development, making a healthy ROI. I was so very wrong. It's become apparent that the tokenomics have been completely manipulated and supply diluted, and all previous correspondence from the team deleted to cover their tracks. They're actively minting and dumping tokens as I write this.

I know I should have diversified my portfolio more. I know I shouldn't have trusted an alt coin. I know I shouldn't have invested more than I was willing to lose. I started my crypto journey in a pretty desperate position, that's why I took on elevated risk. But my situation has only become so much worse and I feel embarrassed and ashamed. It is no ones fault but mine for me choosing to invest, but I didn't expect to be fighting against a malicious, scamming team.

To be honest, I don't even know why I'm posting this here because I think people will just give me hate and make me feel worse. But either way I've just fucking ruined my financial future and no one can help me. It's a really strange feeling to accept absolute failure and say it out loud (well, type it I suppose). 

Don't be like me. I thought I was desperate, but this is another level. Doesn't feel like there's much point carrying on here now when only a miracle could shift my course. Oh well.

Ive been in this space for a while now and decentralization and the governance have been one dimensional... theoretically possible but never fully executable. Every major chain ETH, SOL, you name it, ends up with numerous heated forks or proposals where a few big players call the shots.

Whales vote with their stacks, core devs push code that might not even fix what we actually need, and the rest of us just watch the drama unfold on Twitter. It's like, decentralization? 

Sure, for holding tokens, but not for deciding how the network runs. in some cases, updates feel like patches on a sinking ship, and non-tech guys are left out because who has time to learn Solidity just to suggest a tweak?

Lately, i came across Tau net on YouTube, they are already working on this script. they are building a blockchain where participants just state what they want in plain English... no coding required, and the system uses a logical engine to map out agreements, find consensus on rules, and update itself block by block.

No voting wars, no centralized teams holding the keys. It adapts to what everyone agrees on, turning those specs into actual working software on the fly. Tokens aren't just for speculation; they're tied to real stuff like trading knowledge or compute power, creating value from actual use.

This approach could kill the illusion of decentralization we see everywhere. For example, with something like Tau Net, participants define requirements, and the network mechanically reasons over them to build its own updates. AGRS as the token swaps in at mainnet, but it's more about utility in markets that evolve with the crowd. No more waiting on devs or VCs... the chain becomes what we make it.

Just came across it recently and i joined their community on telegram taunet which i think is the most active compared to the other SNS... cos it felt different... Worth checking...

cryptocurrency,1oil6xd,Polygon has supported this subreddit a lot and I'm insanely bullish - A deep dive on what Polygon has been up to,002_timmy,2025-10-28T21:55:11,0,0.41,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oil6xd/polygon_has_supported_this_subreddit_a_lot_and_im/,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oil6xd/polygon_has_supported_this_subreddit_a_lot_and_im/,"The Messari Q3 report on Polygon (here: [https://messari.io/report/state-of-polygon-q3-2025](https://messari.io/report/state-of-polygon-q3-2025)) is the strongest confirmation yet that the network has regained momentum. For the first time in several years, the story, the data, and the execution all align. POL’s market capitalization grew 39.2% quarter over quarter to $2.36 billion dollars, outperforming the broader crypto market, which rose by 20%. Network activity, institutional participation, and technical upgrades all moved forward in sync.

What excites me most about this report is that it validates what many of us who follow Polygon closely have been sensing. After a few years of searching for direction, Polygon has rediscovered its identity and is executing with focus. The growth across payments, real-world assets, and interoperability shows a network building for real adoption rather than temporary hype.

History Lesson - Polygon was one of the most prominent blockchains during 2021 and 2022. Back then, MATIC was a household name in crypto. DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and gaming applications all flocked to Polygon. It was fast, cheap, and part of Ethereum’s scaling future.

Then the market cooled, prices dropped, and Polygon’s identity blurred. It continued shipping technology, but the narrative was less defined. The ecosystem became large, but scattered, and the token’s performance reflected that uncertainty.

In 2025, that changed. Polygon refocused around two themes with real-world traction: payments and real-world assets. This focus unified its ecosystem under one clear goal of building the financial and transactional backbone for onchain economies. The Messari data shows that this strategy is working. Stablecoin growth, institutional partnerships, and infrastructure upgrades are moving together.

The chain has a strong foundation and a clear direction. The 39% market-cap surge in Q3 is the first tangible signal that the market recognizes that turnaround. To me, it feels like the beginning of Polygon’s second act.

The market performance in Q3 represents renewed confidence in execution. POL now ranks as the second-largest Ethereum Layer 2 token by market capitalization, behind Mantle and ahead of Arbitrum, Optimism, and Immutable. More than 99% of the supply has transitioned from MATIC to POL, completing one of the largest token migrations in the industry.

Polygon’s outperformance is supported by onchain metrics. Daily active addresses increased by 13%, daily transactions rose 20%, and the average transaction fee declined by 23% in POL terms. These metrics indicate expanding usage and improving efficiency at the same time.

When I look at these numbers, I see a market beginning to price real fundamentals again. The price action is following execution, which is what sustainable growth looks like.

Polygon’s payments ecosystem is one of the strongest indicators of real adoption. In Q3, stablecoin supply increased 22% to $2.94 billion. USDT alone grew 35% to $1.4B, while USDC maintained close to $1B.

More importantly, those stablecoins are being used. Payments-focused applications on Polygon facilitated $1.82B in transaction volume across more than 50 platforms during the quarter, up 49% from Q2.

Polygon has also become a hub for innovative payments infrastructure. What excites me most about this growth is that it represents genuine economic activity. They are transfers, purchases, and settlements happening on a scalable blockchain that costs a fraction of a cent per transaction. This is what a functional onchain payments network looks like.

If payments show real consumer traction, real-world assets show that institutions are taking Polygon seriously. The total value of tokenized RWAs on Polygon reached $1.14B (recently grew to $1.6B last week) by the end of Q3. The issuers include government agencies, state banks, and regulated financial entities.

Germany’s NRW Bank issued a 100 million euro bond on Polygon under electronic securities law. Spain’s BeToken launched one of Europe’s first fully regulated equity token offerings. The Philippines Department of Budget and Management implemented a blockchain-based system to track public funds, improving transparency in government spending. Justoken launched tokens backed by physical commodities such as soybeans and soybean oil, with a combined value of over $450M.

These projects mark a shift from experimentation to production. Institutions are using Polygon for financial instruments that carry legal and regulatory weight. This is the kind of adoption that builds long-term credibility. When state banks and government agencies issue assets on a public chain, it changes the perception of blockchain entirely.

For me, this is one of the most exciting parts of the Polygon story in 2025. Real capital is entering the ecosystem, and it is doing so on Polygon because of its reliability, low cost, and Ethereum alignment.

While institutional adoption is accelerating, developer momentum has been equally strong. Polygon ranks fourth in global blockchain developer interest in 2025, behind Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. This shows that the ecosystem continues to attract new builders even as competition increases.

The Agglayer Incubator Program has become a central piece of this growth. The Agglayer connects multiple chains into a unified liquidity network, creating an environment where assets and users move seamlessly between ecosystems. 

Several breakout projects have emerged from this initiative. Katana, a DeFi-optimized Layer 2 chain, launched earlier this year with deep liquidity and sustainable yield mechanisms. Miden continues to advance zero-knowledge virtual machine research. Billions focuses on institutional DeFi infrastructure, while other projects explore areas such as onchain identity and privacy.

This expanding network of independent but interoperable chains is what sets Polygon apart in 2025. It is not competing to be a single chain; it is building an interconnected ecosystem under the Agglayer framework.

Polygon’s resurgence is also visible in its community engagement. **On October 1, 2025, Polygon became the first blockchain to formally sponsor and participate in** r/CryptoCurrency **as a Community Sponsor.** They are officially a sponsor of this subreddit and have distributed $5000 in POL rewards to users of the sub.

According to Surf AI’s (another AMA participant) sentiment analysis, Polygon leads all Layer 2 solutions in positive Reddit discussions, with 78 percent bullish mentions compared to 62 percent for competitors. This shows that sentiment around Polygon has turned positive again as users see progress across the ecosystem.

The renewed focus on education and open communication reflects Polygon’s effort to focusing meaningfully in crypto communities and cultures. I view this community alignment as a strong sign of maturity.

Several major developments this quarter have strengthened Polygon’s position further.

* **Institutional Staking:** AMINA Bank launched regulated POL staking on October 9, 2025, offering compliant yield opportunities for institutional investors. This could unlock large amounts of capital from entities that have been waiting for regulatory clarity.
* **Polymarket Expansion:** Polymarket, one of the most active applications on Polygon, saw its trading volume increase tenfold year over year in 2025. It now represents a significant share of Polygon’s DeFi activity and recently completed a $2B raise at a $9B valuation.
* **Developer and Institutional Leadership:** Polygon continues to attract developers and enterprises alike through programs such as the Agglayer Incubator.
* **Vitalik Buterin’s Endorsement:** In mid-October 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin publicly praised Polygon’s contributions to Ethereum scalability and its early leadership in zero-knowledge research.

One of the most exciting developments this week is Polygon Labs’ collaboration with Manifold Trading, a quantitative investment firm specializing in institutional-grade liquidity. This partnership represents a major leap toward professional market standards in decentralized finance.

Manifold will bring data-driven liquidity management, quantitative market-making, and tighter spreads to Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem. In traditional markets, firms like Manifold ensure smooth execution and consistent pricing across venues. That structure has largely been missing in DeFi, where liquidity often sits idle or fragmented across decentralized exchanges.

By applying institutional execution practices to onchain markets, Polygon and Manifold are building a system that offers predictable depth and lower slippage. For context, compressing the spread on a one-million-dollar trade from 50 basis points to 5 basis points can save more than 4,000 dollars in execution costs. Scaled across billions in trading volume, these efficiencies make DeFi truly investable at institutional scale.

Manifold’s strategies will operate across Polygon’s major decentralized exchanges to harmonize pricing and ensure new markets launch with meaningful depth from day one.

For fintechs and neobanks exploring onchain payments or tokenized asset trading, the benefits are immediate. Polygon’s network can now deliver the execution quality and stability of traditional financial systems while maintaining the transparency and openness of DeFi.

This is a direct extension of the vision Polygon has been building toward all year. With infrastructure capable of 5,000-plus transactions per second, sub-five-second finality, and unified cross-chain liquidity through the Agglayer, the network is becoming a full-stack solution for global payments and institutional finance. The Manifold partnership makes that vision tangible by turning liquidity itself into an institutional-grade product.

Polygon’s infrastructure progress has been equally important. The Bhilai Hardfork, Heimdall v2, and Rio Testnet upgrades have all delivered major performance improvements.

The Bhilai Hardfork increased throughput to over 1,000 transactions per second, raised the block gas limit, and implemented account abstraction through EIP-7702. Heimdall v2 reduced transaction finality from one to two minutes down to approximately five seconds by upgrading the consensus layer. The Rio Testnet, which is moving toward mainnet, introduces stateless verification and validator redesigns that could enable up to 5,000 transactions per second.

Polygon also launched Agglayer CDK Enterprise, a toolkit that allows institutions to deploy privacy-enabled EVM chains that remain interoperable with the main ecosystem. This combination of scalability, privacy, and interoperability is a major step toward institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure.

Average transaction fees have dropped to roughly 0.0027 dollars, making Polygon one of the most efficient networks in the space. For payments and RWAs, those economics are critical.

Polygon’s 2025 story is one of renewal. The network has moved from a period of uncertainty to a position of clear strength. Its focus on payments, real-world assets, and interoperability has created measurable growth across both retail and institutional segments.

The community is re-engaged, the developer base is expanding, and institutions are beginning to trust Polygon for real financial applications. The Messari report captures this turning point with data, but the larger narrative is about execution and focus.

The 39% rise in market capitalization in Q3 is, in my view, only an early indication of what lies ahead. Polygon has rebuilt its foundation, aligned its strategy with real demand, and positioned itself at the center of Ethereum’s scaling ecosystem. If the current trajectory continues, Polygon could become one of the most important networks in the next phase of blockchain adoption.",DISCUSSION,True,,False
cryptocurrency,1oikeeb,Solana ETF goes live… but the vibes feel different than past “first day” crypto moments,Gullible-Tale9114,2025-10-28T21:25:08,4,0.56,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oikeeb/solana_etf_goes_live_but_the_vibes_feel_different/,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oikeeb/solana_etf_goes_live_but_the_vibes_feel_different/,"Maybe it’s just me, but BSOL’s first day didn’t feel like a cultural event the way early BTC or even ETH ETF launches did. Volume was solid, flows look promising, and GSOL’s conversion tomorrow adds heft. Yet the noise level is… muted. No meme tsunami, fewer victory laps, more “cool, noted” from the timeline.

That’s not necessarily bad. In 2021, retail FOMO plus social hype were jet fuel… and whipsaw risk. Today’s setup is more methodical. Institutions can now get SOL through a ’33 Act wrapper on the NYSE… Bitwise priced it at 0.20% with a temporary fee waiver and even included staking… the fee war is very real. It’s efficient, but also kind of sterile. The adoption many of us wanted… just delivered in a suit and tie.

Context matters too. Attention is fragmented. FinTwit is busy with AI mega-caps and macro. And psychology plays a role: a new SOL ETF is big for the ecosystem, but it doesn’t hit like “the first ever spot BTC ETF.” Once the category exists, follow…ons feel incremental… even if they move real capital over quarters.

The bull case is straightforward: if BTC and ETH are the “core,” SOL can become the “growth” leg for multi…asset mandates. If flows compound… if tracking stays tight… if distribution widens beyond day…one curiosity… $3B over 12…18 months isn’t crazy. The bear (or at least sober) case: early volume ≠ durable demand, and crypto ETP flows can be lumpy. Without persistent creations, spreads widen and enthusiasm fades.

One interesting angle here… as more traditional investors gain exposure through ETFs, the tax side of crypto investing is about to get more layered. Swaps, staking rewards, conversions, and even ETF-based gains all feed into taxable events in different ways. It’s a good reminder that if you’re already balancing on-chain trades with new ETF exposure, tools like Awaken tax make life a lot easier by syncing wallets and exchange data automatically so you don’t end up sorting hundreds of transactions at year end.

My read: this is a legitimacy step, not a confetti cannon. The question isn’t “did it pop today?” It’s “does it keep showing up on statements for the next six earnings calls?” Anyone else feeling that shift… from hype cycles to slow, boring normalization?",ANALYSIS,True,,False
cryptocurrency,1oijw6o,"A Nasdaq-listed company plans to move $200M of ETH onto an Ethereum L2 Blockchain (Linea) and restake it through etherfi / EigenLayer infrastructure.

The ETH will be staked and restaked through etherfi and EigenLayer-based infrastructure such as EigenCloud, with Anchorage Digital providing regulated custody.

This marks a shift from passive holding to active participation in Ethereum’s security economy. Instead of letting ETH sit on the balance sheet, SharpLink is locking it into validator and restaking contracts—earning yield while contributing to network security.

Restaking, in this context, allows the same ETH collateral that secures Ethereum to also secure external protocols. These can include oracle networks, data-availability layers, or systems like ""verifiable AI"" that rely on cryptographic guarantees. In effect, ETH becomes programmable collateral: similar to gold, but capable of being configured to act as security capital for any protocol, to underwrite its digital infrastructure.

Routing the deployment through Linea highlights how Ethereum’s scaling stack is maturing, and is no longer just a developer sandbox. Corporate treasuries can now interact with Ethereum's cryptoeconomic protocols.

The broader significance is structural: if more institutions treat ETH as productive security collateral, Ethereum evolves from a transaction platform into a base layer of economic trust whose security can be rented by other protocols. SharpLink’s move is very promising for that reason.",MARKETS,True,,False

why people still get caught is boring and simple. exchanges file reports and answer lawful requests. banks flag big cash outs. your on-chain life leaves loud breadcrumbs… nfts, staking rewards, bridge receipts, lp tokens, all of it. then the mismatch letters show up because you sold on exchange a, didn’t file anything, and the agency already has the data. easy pickings.

what actually gets taxed depends on your country, but the usual story is the same. selling for fiat, swapping coin a for coin b, or spending crypto counts as a disposal. staking, mining, airdrops, yield, referral payouts, all usually hit as income at fair market value when you receive them. nft flips are typically capital gains. stablecoin interest is usually ordinary income. and if your records vanished with a dead exchange, it’s still on you to reconstruct cost basis.

the faceplants are also predictable. a 1099 or local equivalent isn’t “profit,” it’s gross proceeds or rewards. you still need cost basis to get to real gains or losses. people ignore coin to coin trades. they treat defi like a black box when swaps, providing and pulling liquidity, and wrapping can all be taxable events. privacy coins or mixers add privacy, they don’t grant legal immunity. and losing your seed phrase often means losing your paper trail too.

there’s a simple way to stay clean without losing your mind. list every venue you touched and pull the data early… csvs from exchanges, full on chain history for your addresses. rebuild cost basis using your jurisdiction’s rules like fifo or specific id. tag income correctly at value on receipt. mark self transfers so they don’t look like sales. reconcile year end balances to what your ledger says. save everything… tx hashes, screenshots, csvs… in a folder per tax year. tools help here..you can use a tool for that I personally use awaken to match on chain lots to exchange reports so my numbers aren’t vibes as it saves me a lot of time… use whatever you trust, just don’t wing it. if you messed up, amend sooner not later. if your setup is complex, a crypto literate tax pro is worth it.

you can still care about privacy the legal way. use fresh addresses for new contexts and avoid reusing receive addresses. self-custody is fine, just keep meticulous records. think twice about doxxing wallets with public usernames. if you touch privacy tools, know your local rules before you do.

The bottom line is…you can be pro-privacy and still pro-compliance. the chain is more transparent than people think and the tax machine is more automated than it used to be. if you like sleeping at night, treat crypto like any other investment or income stream… track it, report it, move on with your life.
not tax or legal advice… rules vary by country… talk to a professional for your specifics.",DISCUSSION,True,,False

Here are some of the key findings from our latest report:

* Since 2014, 44% of all processed crypto payments have been made in Bitcoin.
* It remains the #1 payment method in 2025, accounting for 22.7% of all transactions this year, followed by USDT (19.8%), LTC (14%) and USDC (11.5%).
* During the 2022 bear market, BTC payment volume still grew by +41.7%, proving that adoption doesn’t stop when the price dips.
* Between 2018-2025, 6% of all BTC payments were processed through the Lightning Network layer. This year, LN makes up 11.7% of BTC transactions, enabling faster and cheaper checkouts.
* Bitcoin is most often spent on web hosting, consumer services, and VPNs, industries where global access is most crucial.
* The average order size is €132, ranging from microtransactions to large purchases like travel and tech.
* More merchants are holding collected BTC (25.9%) from sales instead of converting it, the highest level since 2022.

The talk is sufficiently laymen. It's worth paying attention to the accelerating timeline, his reasons for why NIST's deadline is too late, and his encouragement to stop acting dismissively.

I liked his remark about IBM never having missed a deadline, and how he uses IBM's timeline as the most conservative estimate, which is ahead of NIST's deadline. IonQ timeline is way ahed of NIST's deadline.

I also liked that he spelt it out: those acting dismissively have invariably never had any real understanding of quantum computing.

In the meantime, keep buying Bitcoin.

Crypto bros have traditionally dismissed it all and also claimed ""The world will have much bigger problems if RSA or ECC is cracked."" which is funny when you think about it, because out of all the big & high stake systems you could attack,  a crypto network would likely be one of the first, simply because attacking other big & high stake systems has a higher risk of sending you to jail. In other words, the other big systems have an inherent higher level of protection.

The problem of ""lost"" coins is a big one, as those aren't protected. People no longer in control of private keys (lost, dead, etc) will not be able to upgrade, so their coins will be available to crackers. Devs can theoretically block those addresses but that's a big pandora's box and I don't see it happening in Bitcoin as it would undermine the whole thesis of ""nobody controls Bitcoin"" (plus devs don't actually know if an address is dead). They possibly could add functionality to the chain such that a quantum private key derived from a classic key can unlock the funds, giving the true owner a bit of time to claim their coins before crackers get to it.

Lost coins have no legislation protecting them. If you crack it, it's yours. Cracking equipment at first will only be available to QC manufacturers themselves, then big corps, then governments, before organized crime and smaller crime can afford/get their hands on it. Who wouldn't want Satoshi's stash?

*P.S. Bitcoin MODs: you're hurting your own community, and your message to me says more about you. Banning me from r/Bitcoin for posting this video with ""you're obviously not here to learn about bitcoin"" is ironic, given the video is meant to help people learn.

In case of crypto currencies everywhere the importance of using cold storage and keeping ones seed phrase away from the internet is stressed.

But when using online banking, my bank account is accessible online, and my password is stored in a password manager.

Why the discrepancy here? If someone got access to my online banking e.g. by a phishing attack they could do a lot of harm, too.

Additional question: Would keeping half the seed phrase in a password manager and the other half on a sheet of paper not be the optimal solution? That way someone who gets access to either my pw manager or the sheet of paper, they still won't be able to access my wallet.

What I think I understand (correct me if I’m off):

PPoS (Algorand): Private VRF selects proposer + a large committee each round; BA* finalizes the block in a few steps → deterministic finality in seconds. Attack needs short-window committee capture (>⅔ of online stake) despite private selection.

Ouroboros (Cardano): Stake-weighted VRF picks a slot leader each slot; fork-choice on chain density; probabilistic finality (reorg risk decays with confirmations). Security assumes majority honest stake across time; large SPO set handles block production.

The country has been ranked fifth most crypto-friendly globally in the 2025 Henley & Partners Crypto Wealth Report, citing its zero-tax regime for crypto trading and staking. On the AI side, a recent study by KPMG found that 97 per cent of UAE respondents say they have used AI for work, study or personal purposes... well ahead of the global average of 83 per cent.

he next generation is clearly playing a stronger role: more than 67 per cent of UAE family offices report active or extensive involvement of successors in investment decision-making, a clear signal that multigenerational wealth is being shaped by emerging digital-first leadership.

Top tier platforms like Bitget and others are already integrating Ai into crypto with the likes of GetAgent which helps users make better crypto decisions. they are also listing ai inclined tokens like COMMON, a project that's quietly building tools for communities to reward real participation.

Standard Chartered’s regional head for EMEA and Global Head of South Asian Community, Vinay Gandhi, said: “Family offices in the UAE are embracing technology in a way that reflects both vision and discipline. They see digital assets and AI not as speculative tools, but as integral components of a more connected, efficient and resilient wealth ecosystem.""

cryptocurrency,1ohjo95,The $VULT Token Launch is Here — Redefining Self-Custody,Vultisig,2025-10-27T17:49:40,7,0.61,5,https://i.redd.it/9mboe0u1ooxf1.png,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1ohjo95/the_vult_token_launch_is_here_redefining/,"# What is Vultisig and Why It Matters

Vultisig is the self-custody revolution. A next-generation wallet built on Multi-Party Computation (MPC) that eliminates every single point of failure. Your private keys never exist in one place, are never stored, and can never be leaked or phished. Multiple devices work together to approve transactions, creating a security model that is virtually unbreakable.

It is designed for both individuals and institutions who demand control without compromise. Vultisig combines elite-grade security with simplicity and speed. Beyond secure storage, users can trade across multiple blockchains directly within the app. No exchange. No seed phrases. Just true, modular self-custody.

# Recent Progress

In the past year, Vultisig has evolved from a promising project into a global force. It expanded chain support to ZEC, TRON, DASH, and MANTLE, enhanced cross-chain swaps, launched a viral referral program, and reached one of its most anticipated milestones: the **Vultisig App Store.**

Launching in Q4, the App Store introduces self-custodial automation modules like DCA, payroll, and copy trading, all built directly into the wallet. Every process stays on your device. No middlemen. No trust needed. Just programmable freedom.

# Introducing the $VULT Token

$VULT is more than a token. It is the fuel, the foundation, and the future of Vultisig’s ecosystem. It powers everything from trading fee discounts to governance and more. Holding $VULT means owning a piece of the infrastructure that is redefining how people hold their assets.

As adoption grows, $VULT becomes the connective thread across every layer of the Vultisig network. Each swap, module, and automation flow strengthens the token’s utility and reinforces its position at the core of the movement.

This is not a speculative launch. It is the ignition of a complete economic engine built on self-custody.

# Launch Structure

The $VULT launch follows a clear and transparent structure, built to reward early conviction and broad participation.

**Whitelist Phase, 12pm UTC on 27th of October:** Reserved for early Vultisquad members with purchase caps to maintain fairness and accessibility.

**Public Phase, 12pm UTC on 28th of October:** Opens 24 hours later, welcoming new entrants and allowing organic price discovery.

**Exchange Listing:** $VULT will be listed on Kraken Exchange immediately on Public launch, bringing deep liquidity and global visibility to the movement.

This structure eliminates gas wars and prevents manipulation, giving everyone a chance to enter on equal terms.

# The Moment

Vultisig is no longer just a wallet. It is a movement, a mindset, and now a fully realized ecosystem powered by $VULT.

The crypto world is watching the rise of a new standard in self-custody. $VULT has already captured global attention, becoming the number one token by mindshare worldwide — and this is only the beginning.

The era of seed phrases and centralized control is ending. The era of **Vultisig** has begun.

All these random memecoins and hype tokens aren't going to make you rich. I'll be blunt, it's basically gambling…unless you’re an insider or the creator of the token, the odds are against you.

If you buy a coin, that means someone  is selling it…that’s how the market balances out. When market crashes, it could be you holding the bag. If you look a little deeper, you’ll notice most of these meme and alt tokens run on the same blockchains and mirror the same price movements as the major coins. They’re driven almost entirely by hype and emotion, not real fundamentals. 

crypto as a whole clearly has a future. Decentralized technology will almost certainly reshape how global finance operates. tho I’m skeptical that any current crypto will be that global standard. 
However talking about the current environment. The current government administration has been openly pro-crypto, and as seen on Oct 10th we all know how easily market can be manipulated. When the president pardons exchange founders after they pay millions in lobbying fees, when his family launches crypto ventures and tokens pump right after policy announcements, that's not a healthy market..that's manipulation.

so, if you actually wanna make money in this market, pick a solid coin with real fundamentals. Buy it and hold. Don’t try to trade every single pump. Most people entering now are going to have to wait for the next major leg up. Every market cycles. We saw a bull run in 2020, hit a top in 2021, we saw a bull run this year also, crashed on oct 10, and now we’re in a volatile phase heading into 2026. If you end up buying near the peak, just hold steady and wait for the next run.

if you’re going to hold and occasionally rebalance, keep clean records so tax season doesn’t blindside you. i’ve been using awaken.tax to match on-chain lots with exchange reports and tag staking income so my 1099s and cost basis don’t turn into a mess. use whatever tool you trust… just don’t wing it.

Holding long-term is the actual investment strategy. Hype trading and chasing memecoins is just gambling with extra steps. Please don’t be lazy and irrepressible with your hard earned money",ANALYSIS,True,,False

Is there a calculator that can show how much money you would’ve lost to funding fees? 

I know the fee differs between CEXs, but I’d like to assume it’s roughly the same across major ones and that’s good enough. So a calculator for any major exchange, or for average BTC funding fees, would be fine.

Reason: I’m trying to figure out whether small-leverage longs (1.5x–2x) are worth it if they stay open for such a long time.

Even in open systems, code often remains centralized. A small group of developers ends up steering direction, while millions of users have little to no real input.

As Song puts it: When developers value different things than users, something has to give. Either you get new developers aligned with users, or users leave.

This is less a technical issue and more a coordination one.
How do you align large, global communities when human consensus doesn’t scale?

Many projects have tried to solve this through voting based governance, but that approach has serious flaws:

1. Code proposals are too complex for most users to evaluate.

2. Voting doesn’t scale, who decides what gets voted on?

3.Hierarchies and political dynamics inevitably form.

4. Expression gets reduced to binary “yes/no” inputs that miss nuance.

In short, even decentralized systems can fall into centralized coordination traps.

Recently, some new approaches have started emerging. One of them from Tau Net, led by Ohad Asor takes a very different route. Instead of relying on voting, it uses a logical AI system that interprets what users mean (in computable language), maps out areas of agreement and conflict and then derives consensus automatically.

Whether or not this specific model succeeds, it raises an important question. 
Can we build governance mechanisms that reflect what communities actually think and want without depending on hierarchy, politics, or mass voting?

It feels like this might be the next frontier for crypto, solving the human side of decentralization.

Is something like this the natural evolution of decentralized governance, or is true user-controlled consensus still a pipe dream?",TECHNOLOGY,True,,False

Recently, I got really interested in the idea that people might actually be trading on inside info on Polymarket.

Polymarket’s data is all public, it just isn’t easy to visualize or filter out all the sports bets and low-impact events. So I created [**Polywhaler**](https://www.polywhaler.com/): a website that tracks large whale trades and potentially suspicious activity across Polymarket in real time.

You can see:

* Every non-sports trade over $10k
* Which markets whales are suddenly piling into + trade impact on odds
* A calculated “insider score” (might suggest someone knows something)
* Add crypto wallets to your watchlist to track specific traders
* Discord alerts for live whale trades
* Crypto price prediction markets (experimental, but fun to track)

It’s still early and pretty barebones, but would love to hear feedback or feature ideas, especially from anyone who follows Polymarket or enjoys watching these new internet markets and how accurate they are on predicting events.

As you can see in the image above, the latest data from a16z, it shows something really interesting, 42% of the founders are building right now or planning to build on Ethereum and Base. That is more than every other chain combined.

* Ethereum - 22%
* Base - 20%
* Solana - 16%
* Bitcoin - 8%

This is not just a stat, it is a clear signal of where the next wave of innovation is heading. Ethereum still plays for the long tame and they are trusting its foundation. The liquidity, the tooling and the dev culture are still unmatched.

Then we have base, another success for Ethereum because it is a L2. Base supported by Coinbase is basically building a friendly on ramp into the Ethereum ecosystem in a fast, cheap and normie proof way. This is also attracting developers to work on it.

Solana is not far away from them but in other aspects Solana is really far away from Ethereum ecosystem.

It looks like the multi chain dream is evolving into a multi layer Ethereum reality and base might be the layer that takes it mainstream.

**What it does (plain English):**

* New coins = potential sellers. If typical buyers can’t absorb that flow (given liquidity), price tends to drift down; if they can, it holds or climbs.
* You can tweak **starting price, liquidity, daily issuance, % of issuance sold now, buyers, sellers, timeframe, and randomness** and watch the chart update.

**Why I made it:** most threads argue about “inflation bad vs. good” in abstract. This lets you model both sides and see path + sensitivity.

But according to Politico’s reporting and public lobbying filings, that pardon didn’t just happen... binance and CZ spent serious money trying to make it happen.

In late september, binance hired Ches McDowell ...described in multiple reports as tied to Trump’s circle and close to Donald Trump Jr.... to lobby the White House and treasury. his firm, Checkmate Government Relations, disclosed $450k for roughly one month’s work on “financial services policy and executive relief” targeting the White House Office and Treasury Department. And that’s just one piece of it.

In March, Zhao also hired Teresa Goody Guillén... a crypto lawyer who had been reported as under consideration for SEC chair.... to lobby the White House for “executive relief.” Reports indicate her firm has received around $290,000 from Binance and Zhao in 2025.

overall, reports put binance’s 2025 lobbying around $860k so far. separately, the trumplinked World Liberty Financial venture launched this year and has clear Trump family connections, though there’s no public filing showing a formal Binance partnership. Coverage describes significant paper gains and fundraising around that venture, with estimates and amounts varying across outlets.

Rep. Maxine Waters called the pardon a favor for “crypto criminals,” arguing it came after months of lobbying and money flowing into Trumplinked crypto ventures. Trump defended the move by saying Zhao “was persecuted by the Biden administration” and that what he did “wasn’t a crime.”

But CZ pleaded guilty to violating U.S. antimoneylaundering laws and accepted a fourmonth sentence. What’s clear is this wasn’t some random act of mercy ..... it followed a concentrated, expensive lobbying push aimed at senior executivebranch offices using Trumpworldconnected lobbyists. They hired heavyweight lobbyists, spent serious money, and operated within Trumplinked crypto circles throughout 2025.

It’s a pretty stark reminder of how deep regulation and influence now run in crypto. The same compliance systems that failed at the top are the ones regular investors are expected to handle on their own  accurately, every tax season, with no lobbyist to clean up the mess later.

That’s why a lot of traders I know have started automating the boring side tracking trades using awaken, wallets, and tax exposure in real time  just to stay ahead of the gray areas. Because in this space, *not knowing* the rules costs you more than any lobbying bill ever could.

Whether that’s just how Washington works or something closer to corruption depends on your perspective. But the pardon undeniably arrived after a costly and highly targeted influence campaign.",DISCUSSION,True,,False

I understand price movements with crypto can be extreme and some days you’ll be at a profit and receiving staking rewards.  And other days you’ll be at a loss and receiving staking rewards.

I’m sure this process is too complicated to separate the income from staking at a profit and staking at a loss.

* You’re given a random asset (crypto or stock) and cutoff date.
* You place a trade with optional stop loss & take profit.
* You fast-forward the chart until the outcome is reached.

Checkout the candles here, they’re producing “dead candles” which the term might be different but essentially it’s a candle stick with no wick which isn’t a good sign for the markets at all, last time this happened was a week ago before 50% dump.

2H timeframes show bear signals.
1H timeframes show bear signals.
30m timeframes show bear signals.

1D RSI is about 50% which is a risk zone for correction.

I’ve tried every major CEX out there. Coinbase, Bitget, Binance, all of them. They all suck. But MEXC? MEXC is on another level of broken and I’m actually losing my fucking mind.

The fees are so good I can’t leave. That’s the only reason I’m still here. The ONLY reason. Everything else about this exchange makes me want to scream into the void.

## Let me tell you about this absolute disaster:

**You can’t fetch transactions older than ONE MONTH via their API**

ONE MONTH.

Not one year. Not six months. ONE. FUCKING. MONTH.

Want your trading history from two months ago? Doesn’t exist. Want to do your taxes? You’re fucked. Want to track literally anything over time? Too bad.

The data is RIGHT THERE on their website. You can see it. It exists. But via the API? Nope. Fuck you.

There is NO technical reason for this. None. Zero. They’re just incompetent. Every other exchange gives you your full history. But MEXC? Nah. Apparently 30 days is all you get because why the fuck not.

This is INSANE. This is actually INSANE. How do you run an exchange and not let people access their own fucking transaction history?

**BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT are RESTRICTED via the API**

THE TWO BIGGEST COINS. RESTRICTED. VIA THE API.

Their reason? “To prevent bots.”

THE API IS FOR BOTS. THAT’S WHAT AN API IS FOR. THAT’S THE ENTIRE FUCKING POINT.

“Oh but you can use BTC/USDC!” I don’t want to use USDC. Nobody wants to use USDC. Why would I want worse liquidity? What is the actual point of this restriction?

**Their endpoints don’t support multiple symbols**

Want data for multiple trading pairs? Make a thousand API calls. Enjoy hitting rate limits because they can’t implement basic batch operations.

This is not complicated. This is API basics. Every modern API does this. But not MEXC. They’d rather you spam their servers like an idiot.

## I’m actually done

The exchange works. The fees are incredible. The coins are there. The liquidity is great.

But the API is so fucking broken I can’t believe it’s real. It feels like nobody at MEXC has ever actually used their own API. Or any API. Ever.

I’ve given feedback. Nothing happens. Other people have been asking for these features for YEARS. They don’t do shit.

They clearly don’t give a fuck. They have their users, they have their volume, so why bother fixing anything?

let’s be more realistic,  beyond all the hype.What really matters is the ability to transfer money in exchange for a service.
So, the only clear use case we have right now is payments.

Looking at the current ecosystem,
we see many coins but very little real-world usage.

Even with Ethereum, I doubt there’s much genuine use beyond buying or selling crypto.

Never thought I’d be writing this but here we are.

Cardano today is not where I thought it would be when I first bought in January 2021.

At the time we were sold on the idea that Cardano would “change the world” and that we would “bank the unbanked”

Today we are no closer to that vision in my opinion.

Don’t get me wrong. I’ve had some personal success working with projects early on writing content and such. It’s now my full time job.

But I’ve been immensely disappointed by progress on many fronts including scaling, native USDC, support for content creators like myself, and overall lack of support for builders.

I also thought that governance would be the thing that really brings Cardano forward. But it’s brought a ton of infighting

The community always seems to be fighting about what proposal gets funded and what doesn’t. And it’s exhausting. And demoralizing 

Catalyst, a grant fund, seems as though it’s been somewhat corrupted by people who know how to work the system to get money to fund unprofitable projects

But that’s a separate issue

I’ve been diversified out of Ada for a while now because of the above reasons and more.

I was a long time, hardcore advocate for Cardano in the early days especially in this subreddit. Now not so much.

In terms of Defi, the rest of the industry has surged way ahead of Cardano and it’s not even close. 

I’ve learned a lot since coming into crypto in 2019. 

I think the most important lesson I’ve learned is to just try everything and not lock myself down too hard into one place.

I’m grateful for all the opportunities I’ve been awarded nonetheless and especially grateful for all the friendships I’ve made.

At this point I can call some of them my fam.

Those are my raw thoughts on Cardano

Opti out 

Edit: for what’s its worth, I say this as someone who’s been deeply embedded in the Cardano community for a long time. 

What I say in this post is the current state of things. Who knows how things change in the future",ANECDOTAL,True,,False

Source: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251021a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251021a.htm)

The Fed just gave DeFi a golden ticket, welcoming stablecoins, tokenization, and AI to reshape payments. A new “payment account” could unlock direct Fed rail access for compliant firms. Ethereum’s DeFi dominance is set to soar, and altcoins? They’re not dead, they’re gearing up for a massive comeback.

Fed Governor Waller declared a “new era” where DeFi isn’t the enemy, it’s a partner. Stablecoins, tokenization, and AI are now on the Fed‘s radar, with hands-on research to back it up. A proposed “payment account”, a capped, no frills master account for eligible firms. This means faster fiat, stablecoin swaps, smoother on/off-ramps, and tokenized payments on overdrive. Fed Rails Open Up a streamlined account (no interest, no overdrafts) could slash friction for DeFi players, making rails accessible to innovators.

* AI + Payments: The Fed’s hyped on AI for fraud, risk, and routing, perfect for programmable L1s and L2s like Ethereum.
* Ethereum’s Throne: With \~60% of DeFi’s TVL, ETH’s liquidity, tooling, and institutional heft make it the king of this shift.

Altcoin Season Is Coming!

The Fed’s pivot is a lifeline for altcoins, but don’t expect an overnight moon. This is a builder’s rally, not a meme coin pump. Smart contract L1s and L2s think Solana, ADA, Polygon, Avalanche, ... stand to gain as DeFi gets regulatory clarity and better rails. Stablecoin and tokenization projects (Chainlink, Polkadot, …) could thrive as tokenized assets scale. Be patient, altcoins need time to align with compliance, build infrastructure, and ride Ethereum’s coattails. The season’s brewing, and late 2025 or 2026 could be explosive for projects that play this right.

Why Not Bitcoin? BTC’s a store of value, not a DeFi workhorse. This is about programmable chains and compliant infrastructure, Ethereum and altcoins are the real winners. The Fed isn’t just okay with DeFi, it’s inviting it to rebuild the payment system. This is the state saying, “Get on our rails, now!” Ethereum’s DeFi giants and scrappy altcoins are ready to seize this moment.

What’s Next? This is exploration, not policy, hold the confetti. But the Fed’s moving fast, and DeFi’s in the driver’s seat. Watch Ethereum, compliant stablecoins, and altcoins building for the long game. Altcoin season is coming, the fuse is lit.

Always be mindful that news can be overhyped. Invest wisely by DCA in during low risk and DCA out during high risk . Keep an eye on ETH as a market leader, it hasn’t made a durable break above its ATH yet. As of Right now, its price is $3,969, with a corresponding risk score of 47 out of 100.",GENERAL-NEWS,True,,False

Bitcoin is not scalable and its developers left the project so it can’t be upgraded.

For those reasons, I think most of the world and  bitcoin maxis are just delusional or uneducated about the other coins that are as secure and decentralized while being faster/scalable. 

Many people think bitcoin will hit $1 million. I only see that happening not because bitcoin is the best, but because it had first mover advantage, it’s a house name, and many have invested so much in it already that it makes it seem like it’s too big to fail. Sure it’s the safest investment but that’s only because it has so much liquidity based on hype not actual functionality besides being a store of value.

Most people in crypto are in it to make money and not because they care about the actual fundamentals and technology. That’s where I see most governments, institutions, and companies that are investing in bitcoin are at (they only care about the money or where people have invested the most and not the fundamentals or  technology).

On one hand, we’ve got growing optimism in tech and energy sectors, some signs of recovery in consumer spending, and central banks hinting at holding off on further rate hikes. On the other hand — a ton of uncertainty is still hanging over the market.

A few things I’m curious about and would love to hear your thoughts:

* **Market direction:** Are we about to see a correction or will the rally continue through the end of the year?
* **Trump’s new tariffs:** Do you think they’ll actually protect domestic industries, or will they just backfire and fuel inflation again?
* **Crypto drama:** Feels like we’re overdue for another *major* crypto scandal or exchange meltdown — or maybe the sector’s finally maturing?

I keep seeing mixed signals everywhere — strong earnings but shaky geopolitical news, investor optimism but weak consumer data. It’s starting to feel like we’re standing on a knife’s edge.

Since the last time we were here, I think we all know the market for memes hasn't been so kind. Despite that, we have continued to build to make $HEGE a true brand--we have several video games, we launched our merch store, and just recently, launched [our DAO](https://v2.realms.today/dao/Farke9p1ZDCwDp94rWGut2jaWHogVcGc1TRU6Vd7SeTy/proposals). One of our video games even launched day 1 with Play Solana handheld console, PSG1, and was featured on their launch trailer.

With these developments in mind, we truly do intend to have Hegecoin become a multi-cycle coin--or ""brandcoin"", if you will. The DAO is our most recent effort to solidify the future of the project and ensure that every community member has a voice. After all, the team is not all-knowing, and some of our greatest achievements have been community initiatives.

Governance changes usually require forks or off chain decisions that do not always reflect what participants actually want.

A newer idea suggests using logical AI instead of generative AI to let networks adapt automatically. In this setup, participants describe their requirements in plain language, and the system’s reasoning engine identifies agreement and updates itself accordingly without human coded upgrades or voting rounds.

I have noticed some projects like Tau Net as one of those projects experimenting with this model, which uses logical reasoning to convert participant input into executable rules, allowing the blockchain to evolve directly from user defined specifications rather than developer intervention. The system does not think but mechanically reasons, adjusting its structure based on shared intent.

This idea raises key questions: would such automation reduce governance bias, or just shift control to the AI layer? Could it finally make decentralized systems genuinely participatory, or add new complexity under the surface?",DISCUSSION,True,,False

I've already lossed $1500 in the stock market due to speculative trades in healthcare/pharma around the pandemic... worth a shot, but I'm not working atm even though I got my savings up in my last job. Also I settled on an investment property I'll be moving into in the next 1 or 2 years

Anyway months ago i finally got the courage to get a coinbase account and was going to buy some crypto. It justbglitched out and sent me on a neverending login cycle. Dunno what went wrong. 

Then, I tried a new platform coinspot. All good getting an account. Waited some more time and made up my mind again. XRP this time, it's happening. Oh right, I gotta verify. No worried. But as I'm overseas, my Australian phone is at home so I gotta call my mum to tell me the 2fa... but she's on holidays at some beach and driving back. Okay no worries I'll try tomorrow. 

We get back from a family bday about 4:30. If I call about 6, it'll be my mums morning and she can tell me the 2fa. Well... the internet just randomly goes out. Can't be fixed remotely, the technicians coming tomorrow.

I could use mobile hotspot to get the 2fa and purchase. But maybe there's a few days wait before I can purchase using my card...

In any case, it's just feeling like the universe is telling me not to invest for whatever reason. Think I should just ignore all this? It'll only be a 100 xrp tops. Or should I wait until it's easier. I find going against the grain like this often leads to problems in my experience.

Bitcoin often topped within 2 months before Fed Chair end of term and, selloff into bear market a month after new Fed Chair or new term. That doesn’t cause the move but those windows come with policy headlines and shifting expectations, which markets react to.

Timeline:

Late 2013 to early 2014 (Bernanke step down Yellen start)

* BTC cycle top: Dec 2013 ($1.2k).
* Chair change: Jan 31, 2014 Bernanke ends, Feb 3, 2014 Yellen starts (2 months after the BTC cycle top).
* What followed: a sharp monthly drop of 32% arrived in March 2014 (1 month after).

Late 2017 to early 2018 (Yellen step down Powell start)

* BTC cycle top: Dec 2017 ($19.7k).
* Chair change: Feb 3 to 5, 2018 Yellen ends, Powell starts (2 months after the BTC cycle top).
* What followed: another steep monthly selloff 33% in March 2018(1 month after).

Late 2021 to mid 2022 (Powell term renewal)

* BTC late cycle high: Nov 2021 (\~$69k).
* Chair milestone: first term ended on Feb 5th 2022 (2.5 months); second term was delayed and confirmed on May 2022 (during the shift to rate hikes/QT).
* What followed: the bear market accelerated into a 37% red candle June 2022( again 1 month after).

Why the Fed Chair Matters for Bitcoin:

The U.S. dollar dominates global finance, used in 88% of transactions and 59% of reserves, making the Fed’s monetary policy a key driver of Bitcoin’s price. The Fed controls liquidity via interest rates and QE/QT. Loose policy boosts risk assets like Bitcoin, tight policy suppresses them. Inflation fears also fuel Bitcoin’s “digital gold” appeal. The Fed Chair leads the FOMC, setting policy tone and expectations. A new Chair in 2026 could signal policy shifts, impacting Bitcoin’s volatility. While Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, its trading environment is fiat driven, tying its cycles to Fed actions.

Future Outlook:

Powell’s second term ends May 23, 2026. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could peak around Feb or March 2026 (2+ months prior), potentially followed by a bear market in June 2026, marked by a 30\~40% correction. However, external factors like regulation or global events could shift timelines.

You are right. It isn’t. Treat it so.

“Do Your Own Research” (DYOR) is not a fad but an important element of the cryptoverse. Do keep that in mind.

https://i.redd.it/jaevvgfykvwf1.gif

# Crypto Futures | Warning, Warning!

You already read the warning above and understand that this is not financial advice at all. In fact, this goes beyond warning, and I request you not try it if you haven’t ever tried the Futures market.

https://preview.redd.it/xx6h8vd0lvwf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1194a8db82120229ba003239d9fb8448f286dd14

For your information, I lost USD 20,000 before I even understood how Futures work. Then I lost another USD 1,200 (in INR) on CoinDCX (Indian Crypto Exchange) before I got an idea of how to get it right in Futures. So, I urge you not to try this if you have no clue what the Futures market is all about.

Now that the warning is out of the way, let’s dive straight in.

https://preview.redd.it/r3fv9842lvwf1.jpg?width=1189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2ed4b284cad0a23dfb5442c34a399dbe70e19a5

# To The Futures Players | And the Stalwarts | And the Veterans

So, I keep playing in the Futures market on CoinDCX, and I have some investments on GateIO. I trade on GateIO and play Futures on CoinDCX. In both cases, BTC is common.

Here is something interesting I observed:

1. The price of BTC on GateIO is 50-100 dollars higher than on CoinDCX. I presume this is due to the Exchange’s formulae of averaging the price of BTC on the major exchanges.  
2. Whatever the case, at any given point in time, the difference is at least 50 USD.  
3. And when the price is fast-moving, the difference goes up to 100 USD. I am yet to witness a bigger difference than this. So, safely assume it is between USD 50 and 100.  
4. Now, the regular trader may think of arbitrage, but I don’t think arbitrage will work that fast, or maybe it will with bots. I don’t know, and it is not something I am interested in. You can still check it out. But there is something more, and that is the fun part.  
5. If you are a Futures player who plays scalping or day trading, then you are always asking the question of which direction the price is moving.  
6. However, if you are both on CoinDCX and GateIO, then you can look at the price on GateIO, and whatever the price is, you know the price on CoinDCX is going to be 50 to 100 USD less.  
7. You can look at the direction of trade (increasing or decreasing) and go and buy a Long or Short contract on CoinDCX.  
8. I recommend trying with small amounts first until you get the hang of it. Once you get the hang, buy Long or Short and close the contract when you achieve 10, 20, or even 50% profit on your position.  
9. It is working like a charm for me, and I am loving it completely.

That’s it. That’s the trick.

# Words of Caution | Be Smart About the Trick

This will not work if you see an extremely fast movement of the Bitcoin price upwards or downwards. Why? Because by the time you buy the contract (Long or Short), the price could have reversed, leading to losses.

I have tried this with Bitcoin, but it should work with any coin/token. I recommend not taking a chance with other tokens if you have no idea of their price movements. Bitcoin is easy. Others may not be.

That’s it. So try it out at your own peril!! 😊

tl;dr:

* The best money rails are onchain, on Polygon
* Stable, near-instant, and low-cost, Polygon is the infrastructure payment service providers need to thrive
* Polygon is so easy to build on that many consumers that use popular apps like Polymarket don’t even know they’re on Polygon
* The network is scaling to meet surging demand

https://preview.redd.it/7nl12ll1bvwf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=83f172842e310c134302f7d6ad82c86e9f78dc8c

Your money today is stuck in line at the bank. 

Sending it across borders means paying high fees and waiting days for settlement—plus the feeling that you have to rely on a string of intermediaries who profit off your hard work. 

Now imagine the process without banks, without delays, without enormous fees. That’s the promise of onchain payments—and Polygon is delivering. Send and receive money as easily as a DM.

For the past fifteen years, blockchains have promised peer‑to‑peer finance. But only recently, with a series of payments-focused upgrades for Polygon, has infrastructure matured enough to make real‑time payments feel like the internet. 

Stablecoin volumes on Polygon in Q3 hit all time highs, at $3.4B, and volume was up to 287M, a 21% quarter over quarter increase. Institutions and startups alike are betting big on crypto and integrating on Polygon, including Stripe, Revolut, Nexo, Reliance Jio, and BlindPay. 

And then there’s Polymarket, the first real breakout crypto app. Built and grown on Polygon, Polymarket alone has seen nearly $20B in predictions volume, is the official prediction market for X, and just raised $2B in funding.

All of this indicates something true: there is real momentum for onchain payments and digitally-native money more broadly. This trend has people wondering: Why payments, why now, and what’s next?

# Why payments?

Traditional payment rails weren’t built for a digital, global economy. 

Legacy systems batch transactions, rely on closed ledgers, and charge fees that seem invisible until you need to send money across borders. Worse, settlement can take days, meaning funds remain “in transit” and tied up in capital‑inefficient float. For individuals sending remittances or merchants trying to manage cash flow, these frictions are a barrier to true global scale.

Onchain payments on Polygon solve this. 

Stablecoins like USDC and USDT0 represent one‑for‑one claims on fiat currency and settle on instantly and irreversibly. When you pay someone on Polygon, the transaction finalizes in seconds and costs fractions of a penny. There are no intermediary banks and no cut‑off times. 

* **For businesses**, this means lower operational costs, better margins, immediate liquidity, and programmable financial flows. **‍**
* **For consumers**, it means owning your money and moving it freely.

Polygon’s ecosystem has grown into one of the largest stablecoin hubs because it combines high throughput with low fees. 

Recent upgrades bring the network new dimensions of speed, lightness, and reliability—everything you need in a chain focused on payments and programmable money.

With this foundation, payments on Polygon feel less like a cassette player and more like a streaming platform.

# Why now?

As Polygon scaled Ethereum, it became a natural gateway for onchain financial activity. 

From payments to predictions, Polygon cemented itself as the money rails bringing the next era of digital-native finance. 

And core developers leaned in.

Bringing the world global payments means a network that is:

* Light
* Fast
* Low-cost, and 
* Easy to build on

Every upgrade to Polygon in the last year is a step to doubling down on these qualities longterm so that as demand scales, so does the infrastructure to meet it.

The Rio upgrade transforms Polygon into a faster, lighter, and more resilient network built for payments at scale. With a new block production model, Polygon can now reach up to 5,000 transactions per second, delivering near-instant finality and eliminating the risk of reorgs entirely. Validators benefit from stateless validation, which makes running lightweight nodes easier and lowers the barrier to entry for securing the network. As payments integrations across Polygon continue to grow, Rio only accelerates the trend—pushing the network closer to its vision of real-time, global money movement.

Every upgrade is important to meet surging adoption. The network supports major institutional integrations from Stripe, Polymarket, Reliance Jio, BlindPay, and many others. \\

For builders and users, the combination of high throughput, low fees, gasless UX and five‑second finality means there’s never been a better time to build on or use Polygon for payments.

# What's next?

Polygon’s ambition doesn’t stop at 5k TPS and near-instant finality. 

Polygon’s gigagas roadmap lays out a vision to scale to 100k TPS. Achieving that scale requires rethinking block production and validation, which is why the recent Rio Payments upgrade is such a pivotal moment. Rio introduced a Validator‑Elected Block Producer (VEBloP) model and stateless block validation. Together, these changes boost throughput, eliminate reorgs, and make finality near‑instant. 

In other words, Rio makes Polygon faster, lighter and more reliable. Not in some distant future, but right now.

Looking ahead, the combination of Rio, more seamless interop, and the broader gigagas roadmap paves the way for programmable money and real‑world asset (RWA) tokenization at global scale. 

With instant finality and ultra‑high throughput, institutions can settle tokenized Treasury bills or equities as quickly as buying a coffee. 

AI agents can initiate micropayments on behalf of users, and cross‑chain transactions can occur without liquidity fragmentation. 

Polygon’s upgrades create the financial infrastructure that an AI‑powered and digital economy will depend on.",TECHNOLOGY,True,,False

---

### 🔹 Key Points

- **Performance:** Tested on Ethereum mainnet blocks (45 M gas limit), achieving **proofs for 99.6% of blocks in under 12 seconds**, averaging **6.9 seconds** using 64 × RTX 5090 GPUs.  

- **Hardware cost:** About **$128 K**, roughly half that of comparable prior systems (~$256 K).  

- **Why it matters:**  
  Until now, each Ethereum validator re-executes all transactions in a block to verify correctness. With ZK proving, one prover can perform the computation and everyone else verifies the proof instantly.  
  This could enable **lighter hardware validation** (possibly even on mobile) and **faster finality**.  

---

### 🔹 Implications

- Could push Ethereum toward **~100× scalability** compared to current throughput.  
  The shift from re-execution to proof-verification is a foundational step in scaling the base layer.  
  → [Forklog](https://forklog.com/en/new-scaling-technology-brings-ethereum-closer-to-10000-tps/)

- For developers and users: Faster block validation could reduce gas costs, improve dApp responsiveness, and expand validator participation.

- Caveat: Real-world conditions may differ — large blocks, peak usage, and network latency could still test the system’s limits. Decentralisation and hardware accessibility remain key factors.

---

### 🔹 My Take

This is one of those infrastructure breakthroughs that doesn’t get much attention at first but ends up changing the baseline.  
It’s genuine progress that could make Ethereum feel faster and more accessible *without giving up decentralisation.*

I’m working on a project where I need to build an automated system that can determine the price of a cryptocurrency at the exact time a client’s transaction occurred. The idea is simple: for each transaction, take the coin and timestamp, and fetch the corresponding USD price at that moment.

For this, I’m looking for datasets that provide **historical cryptocurrency prices**

* Coin name or symbol
* Timestamp of the price
* Price in USD

Minute-level resolution or better would be ideal, as cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate rapidly. Datasets can be in CSV, JSON, Parquet. It would be great if the data covers a wide range of coins, not just Bitcoin or Ethereum, since client transactions could involve altcoins as well.

If anyone has access to such datasets, whether public, private, or via an API, I’d greatly appreciate it if you could share it. Any tips on working with large historical crypto datasets efficiently would also be helpful.

The goal is to make a system that can automatically take a client’s transaction and return the exact price at that moment, so having accurate historical price data is essential.

Thanks in advance for any help or guidance!",⛏️ MINING,True,,False

It’s not clear why anyone needs these magic beans, but people buy them anyway, and that has made Ripple very rich—so rich that this week it casually spent $1 billion to buy a treasury management company called GTreasury.

cryptocurrency,1odllow,Could CZ’s inner circle have orchestrated the Oct 10 crash?,ZhenyaV,2025-10-22T22:48:20,0,0.43,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1odllow/could_czs_inner_circle_have_orchestrated_the_oct/,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1odllow/could_czs_inner_circle_have_orchestrated_the_oct/,"Oct 10 was the biggest liquidation in crypto history with just a little push from macro. How come it was bigger the FTX and Covid? 

What’s crazy is that this is it's the second time Trump has nuked the markets. The second biggest liquidation day was earlier this year, on Feb 2nd, when new 25% tarifs were announced on Mexico and Canada, 10% on China. That triggered $2.3B in liq across the board. This time, it was a 100% China tariff threat, and the cascade was even worse.

The consensus theory now is the USDe depeg on Binance. Their unified margin accounts priced collateral like USDe, wBETH, and BNSOL using their own internal spot books instead of external oracles. During an eight-day window before they switched to safer pricing, someone dumped around $60-90M of USDe on Binance. That tanked the price of USDe to $0.65 only on that venue, while everywhere else it stayed near $1. Since Binance valued collateral off its own order books, that one design flaw instantly wiped billions in margin and triggered a global liquidation cascade that totaled around $19B.

Now, two theories are floating around.

The first one: this was an external attack. Someone exploited Binance’s internal pricing bug and profited by shorting BTC and ETH on Hyperliquid, making roughly $200M. As I was researching this topic when preparing a yt video it became clear how risky this gamble was - they risked $90M to only make $200M, under insane conditions that could have easily gone wrong. And probably do go wrong most of the times, we just don't know about them as they can easily be throttled by CEXs. The perpetrator had to know every detail about Binance’s internal pricing of USDe, the unified account logic, and the exact timing of the upcoming oracle change (that was published by Binance beforehand). That kind of precision isn’t random. Plus, if it was an outsider, Binance has probably already flagged those accounts. It’s even questionable whether they ever managed to withdraw their USDe after the dump. They might have burned their bridge with Binance forever.

The second theory is darker. CZ might have allowed this to happen, or at least known about it. Maybe someone from his circle pulled the strings. Pulling off a move like this required insider-level knowledge of Binance’s internal pricing, the timing of the macro headline, and the delayed oracle rollout. Risking $90M in USDe for a $200M gain doesn’t make sense unless you’re sure Binance won’t freeze your account afterward.

But here’s the twist no one came out happy. Big and small market makers, even names like Wintermute, plus retail - everyone got rekt. Binance took massive reputational damage, and sentiment across the board turned negative. If traders or MMs have another option, they’ll take it. Which means Binance as a company couldn’t have benefited from this in any direct way.

Still, CZ has already made a big bet on DEX infrastructure with Aster, while Hyperliquid keeps eating into Binance’s volume and open interest every month. So if you zoom out, the event almost fits the larger narrative: the CEX era fading, and Binance’s leadership quietly shifting toward the DEX model.",DISCUSSION,True,,False

This is my first year investing. I’ve been learning a lot through stocks and ETFs, but recently I started building a long-term crypto portfolio alongside my traditional investments.

My plan is to hold solid projects for 10–15 years and keep a consistent DCA approach instead of trying to time the market.

Here’s what I’m currently DCA’ing into each week:
BTC – $25
ETH – $12
SOL – $10
LINK – $10
XRP – $7
AERO – $12
TAO – $12

I’m mainly focused on projects I think have long-term potential — things like AI, interoperability, and scalable ecosystems. I’m not trying to chase hype coins, just build steady exposure to what might still be relevant in 2035+.

Would love feedback from the community:
	•	Does this seem like a balanced long-term mix?
	•	Anything you’d replace or add?
	•	Any underrated projects worth researching for a 10-year hold?",ADVICE,True,,False

For example bitcoin has added some start contract language.  And I've heard it said there's ways to go from proof of work to proof of stake, if that were desired.

I don't know how that actually happens.  Who agrees with change in the model and how does this protocol change get pushed out?

Here's a few challenges bitcoin has to deal with eventually.
1.  There's a rate limit on the number of transactions.  So either the number of transactions per epoch or the rate of epochs needs to go up by hundreds of fold to be similar to say Visa.  In particular workarounds like lightning network evidently have a model flaw in that it becomes unviable as bitcoin transitions from mining based to fee based.

2. Moving to quantum resistant signatures.

3.  Reducing the cost of mining without losing the security model of cost based (paid in energy) Mining.  Presumably this looks like proof of stake

2025? I think we're seeing a shift toward onchain automation. Not just ""another DEX interface,"" but tools that let you setand-forget strategies without babysitting charts 24/7 or trusting CEXs.

Personally been using [Banana Pro](https://pro.bananagun.io/) for DCA and limit orders directly on-chain. Started as a meme Telegram bot, now its legitimately useful for both ETH and SOL. The fact that I don't think about it anymore means it's working.

But thats just one example. Point is:the next wave of users wont tolerate clunky UX or seed phrase anxiety. They'll need dead-simple web apps that feel like... normal apps.

My prediction: Tools that combine simplicity + self-custody + cross-chain will dominate. No more ""bridge to X chain, swap on Y DEX, export CSV for taxes"" nightmare flows.

Instead of hosting apps in one provider’s data center, it spreads compute and storage across independent nodes operated by different organizations around the world. This means if a single region goes down, like AWS did yesterday, the network keeps running because its logic and data are already replicated everywhere. That resilience comes from blockchain level consensus where every update is verified and finalized across nodes, making tampering or silent failures almost impossible.

All other blockchains only handle payments or simple smart contracts, but the ICP blockchain actually hosts full web services on chain, making it a true alternative to centralized servers rather than just a supporting layer. There are still trade offs such as higher latency, longer recovery times for large state data, and the complexity of decentralized governance. Yet those risks are visible and shared rather than hidden behind one company’s firewall. UTOPIA stands as a working example of crypto solving a real problem by keeping essential systems online when centralized cloud providers fail.",TECHNOLOGY,False,,False

But what do you see as the most likely case in 10-20 years of coins being used or Bitcoin itself? Just a store of wealth or more?

I’ve held crypto for a number of years (mostly BTC/ETH) but find myself often numb to continual articles about ups and down in the market daily - sort of feel it’s not healthy to watch that - I have stocks and don’t watch them every day or week either.

I find the arguments of fiat bad and it going to be replaced by crypto or it’s going to replace it a little cultish. My money in the bank (UK) is 99.9% unlikely to drop 20-50% in value in an hour or 24 hours or longer. 

My money is pretty safe (not that there’s much of it) and backed by the government should the bank fail - again a very big if and very rare occurrence. I can send money with my banks for free within a few seconds: internationally it would incur an exchange fee but I don’t use that anyway and the fee is sort of minimal really depending on the amount.

The rise of ridiculous meme coins and scams is detrimental to seeing any adoption I feel and certainly off putting to people wanting to get involved - and you need security for that to become common.

I have funds on exchanges because it’s the most accessible and for me easiest way - and if say for 99% of people if you want a general person to great involved that’s the best way then a cold wallet which security wise makes sense but isn’t as user friendly as a exchange.

I see it as an investment and feel most other people and companies do too as do other people my age I know. I don’t know anyone in offline who sees it as a currency replacement say and I see some tiny places taking payment for a coffee with BTC online but I think that’s just a waste of it considering fees and such but hey ho.

Is it more the tech being behind adapted by banks that’s happening and due moreso than the coins themselves? I think it’s more likely we get a national digital currency then say the UK adopting BTC - they need to be in control of it for obvious reasons..

When something has already jumped so high in a year, it’s not the moment to average in, I see it as the time to think about locking in gains. And when the economy is in a downturn and the Fed tightens up, piling into high-risk assets makes little sense.  
  
A careful investor knows when to hold back. It’s not about being anti-crypto or anything else. But about knowing when to protect what I have earned. Right now i’m even thinking of having some stock exposure or liquidity as survival, because i still need to deal with rent, food, and fuel costs, and the extras that come with it if traded in the right uex can help. Constantly averaging in during uncertain times can drain someone before the real opportunity even appears. So adding some stock even if it's in my bitget portfolio can still show a way for the two. I know Bitcoin will have its time again, but recovery might take years, much like what happened after the dot-com crash. This phase could be cleansing, pushing out the hollow projects and leaving only what’s real. But don’t rely on old market patterns; this cycle is different, shaped by broader macro forces. The turnaround will come when the stock market steadies, and that could still be a long wait. Keep watching the market with patience, not pressure.

With more people using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital coins for gaming, new crypto casino platforms are launching almost every month. But with so many options, it’s becoming harder to tell which ones are actually worth using.

Every crypto casino claims to offer fast payouts, provably fair games, and anonymous transactions, but once you start playing, the truth often looks very different.

Some of the most talked-about cryptocurrency casinos right now include:

Titantreasure

Jackbit

mbit

Stake

All of them advertise “guaranteed fairness,” “premium bonuses,” and “next-gen blockchain transparency.” But when you dig a little deeper, it’s not always clear how fair the odds actually are, or whether the games are designed to keep you spinning until your wallet runs dry.

A big question in the crypto casino community right now is how transparent and provably fair these sites really are. Most claim to use blockchain verification for their casino games — but do players actually check those proofs, or do we just take the site’s word for it?

It’s also worth looking at how these platforms handle withdrawals and live betting. Some crypto casinos advertise instant payouts, but in practice, delays, withdrawal limits, or extra verification steps are still common. And when you’re dealing with crypto volatility, a delay of even a few hours can make a big difference in the value of your winnings.

I’m genuinely curious, has anyone here actually made consistent profits or had a positive long-term experience with cryptocurrency online casinos? Have you found any sites that truly live up to the “provably fair” promise and make cashing out simple and fast?

Or is crypto gambling more about the entertainment factor, the thrill, the technology, and the community, rather than expecting to walk away ahead in the long run?

If you’ve tried multiple platforms, which crypto casinos do you trust most in 2025? Which ones deliver smooth, fair gameplay. which look great on the surface but disappoint once you start wagering real crypto?

Would love to hear some real experiences from people deep in the cryptocurrency casino scene.",DISCUSSION,True,,False

Here’s the thing. Bitcoin’s security relies on elliptic-curve cryptography. That’s what keeps your private keys safe and prevents anyone from forging transactions. The issue is that a powerful quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could, in theory, break ECC. That means it could figure out your private key just from your public key.

We’re not there yet. Quantum computers today aren’t strong enough, but researchers estimate it might take around a million stable qubits to break Bitcoin’s encryption. The scary part is that companies like IBM and Google are already making steady progress toward that.

And here’s what makes it even more interesting: some governments and major banks are already preparing for the quantum threat. They’re quietly transitioning to post-quantum encryption standards ahead of time. Makes you wonder if they know something the public doesn’t.

Then there’s the store now, decrypt later problem. Hackers could already be saving blockchain data, planning to decrypt it once the tech catches up. That could make old BTC addresses and reused keys vulnerable down the line.

So what do you think? Should Bitcoin start preparing for the quantum threat now, or is it still too early to worry about it?

cryptocurrency,1obw9wt,What is the best wrapper for PAXG?,eccsoheccsseven,2025-10-20T23:44:31,0,0.5,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1obw9wt/what_is_the_best_wrapper_for_paxg/,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1obw9wt/what_is_the_best_wrapper_for_paxg/,"I have to admit, I'm kind of a fan of PAXG.  PAXG if you don't know is an ERC-20 coin soft-pegged to gold.  I've held it for quite a while as my long term flight to safety when not actively trading.  That kind of worked out in my favor recently.  I'm glad I wasn't trading.

I'll tell you what I don't like about it.  Pretty expensive to move around.  We are talking like $3.  Now in the grand scheme of things that's tiny.  But what I mean by this is I wish it wasn't just a decent value store.  I wish it was transactable.

Now this is where I'm going to date how up to date my knowledge is.  Not very.  I nerded out on crypto quite a while ago and then didn't keep up.  Hence the question.

In theory there are wrappers that could make it transactable.  Probably more wrappers than an old hat like me could keep track of.  The question is what would actually be good?  I know polygon, solana, and avalanche are used to wrap things.  No matter what is picked there can be more that one route to actual funding.  One could do a bridge that would incur the high paxg fees at least.  One could exchange it on a dex.  But then you have to find a dex that has decent activity for what is fairly obscure.  I would argue it shouldn't be.  I wish wrapped PAXG was a common coin.

That's why it's worth asking the new hats.  I probably sound like I know more than I do.  I'm a technical dude but with the last few years of crypto I've mostly just kept up with vocab.  That's a pretty shallow level of understanding.  I'm confident in my technical abilities enough to admit when my understanding is shallow in an area.

I do think gold is going to keep going up long term.  And the demand for exchange in gold is going to go up even faster than that.  The perceived future demand for gold based transaction is leading the price.  I also think that crypto is about to hit another period of significant volatility, more so than recent.  In what direction I don't know, but I fear it might be down.  More institutions that need to exchange real value are having to do it more often as they are being confronted with the real-politik of the current era.

We are now in an era of massive transition.  We think AI is causing a lot of transition in our lives but these transitions aren't isolated to us.  Some of the most core institutions are finding themselves in fast moving times compared to what they are used to.  Their standard rate of change is usually akin to molasses or pitch.  We have fiat currencies coming out of existence, like the Argentine peso, and CBDC being attempted, BRICS trying to be a thing, state sponsored resource competition to get the hardware setup for AI, and proxy conflicts between major powers.  And these institutions need to exchange real value when they make changes at the lowest level.  Just like we can exchange on-chain and off-chain, institutions have on-chain and off-chain.  And they have more demand to do more on-chain activity than they have in the past or think that they may need to do on-chain activity in the near future.  And on-chain for them is gold.

Meanwhile on the consumer end, with attempts to create CBDC, many are going to want to prefer solutions they own to do the same thing.  People are going to want to do fast and convenient crypto.  And they are going to want to do it with more stability with something people recognize as having value and governments and institutions recognize as having value being a bonus.  And as mentioned before governments and institutions will very much be recognizing gold.

An era of gold may be upon us, if we want it.  If we can only get the transactability working smooth.  So let's figure it out.  Let's figure out what we are doing and what the standard is to move gold from phone to phone as fast as possible with the lowest fees.  The more of us that know what that standard is the more of us can do it and lead that standard.  This can be a good foot wedged in door alternative to CBDC.  And if we move fast and get that food in the door quickly we can keep the world crypto and free instead of CBDC and controlled.  It also may be harder for government to fight it economically if it exchanges something they themselves need to recognize.

So back to the technical side.  What is the best way for us to do this?",DISCUSSION,True,,False

Even after submitting everything, several people say their funds were never released.



Some users claim they tracked their coins on-chain and saw them moved to other exchanges like HitBTC while Changelly insisted the funds were still “under review.” Others noticed the terms of service quietly changing, or the support team asking for new documents each time one set was completed.



Common red flags mentioned by users:



\- Transactions “on hold” without clear reason or timeline

\- Constantly changing KYC demands

\- Lack of transparency about fund status

\- Funds traced to external exchanges

\- Support giving vague or repetitive replies

\- TOS updates after disputes begin

It was wild to see some of the swings on the majority of the market other than BTC. I’m definitely seeing as well as everyone else the typical 4 year cycle is broken.

For now, I plan to hold only Bitcoin, but I might want to exchange to other coins in the future, so I don’t want a device that’s strictly limited to BTC. I’ve read a lot about Trezor and Ledger, but I’m still unsure which model is the best choice. Many people recommend the Trezor Model T due to its open-source firmware and security features, while others suggest the Ledger Nano X or even the Ledger Stax for their robust build and wide crypto support.

days later: he confirmed a meeting with xi and said the 100% tariff idea was “not sustainable,” effectively softening the policy stance that helped trigger the sell off.

meanwhile: the Financial Times reports the trump family has made roughly $1 billion in pre-tax profits from crypto ventures since the election. that reporting is the basis for the conflict of interest concerns.

the timing looks sus. whatis going on here?

political theater? scare china with a hard line, negotiate back. tariffs become leverage, not the end goal. traders get collateral damage. normal trade negotiation stuff.

policy testing? drop a shock to see market reaction, then calibrate strategy based on fallout. messy but plausible.

conflict of interest? if the family had holdings exposed, a crash and subsequent policy pivot could create trading opportunities. the optics are bad... and that alone justifies independent scrutiny and disclosure.

genuine error? trump makes a bad call, sees chaos, steps back.

regardless of intent, markets hate unpredictability. real people lost real money. a president whose family profits from the industry he regulates raises serious conflict of interest questions.

watch for : asset disclosures tied to policy moves. on-chain data for large wallet trades. congressional pressure for answers. if you were liquidated or sold during the panic, you're likely sitting on taxable events even if you lost money overall. capital losses can offset gains, but only if you report them correctly. given the volatility and political manipulation at play, accurate tax reporting matters more than ever (tools like awaken can help sort through the chaos of liquidations and trades during wild market swings).",ANALYSIS,True,,False
cryptocurrency,1oavwdf,Uptober and its seasonal probability,hduynam99,2025-10-19T18:41:56,20,0.73,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oavwdf/uptober_and_its_seasonal_probability/,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oavwdf/uptober_and_its_seasonal_probability/,"https://preview.redd.it/dpkv4j0yu3wf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=86d4eac071001ecf76b943909082a7673efcaf01

Let’s cut through the Uptober hype with some cold, hard data. You’ve got a chart of Bitcoin monthly returns and you’re eyeing October. From 2013 to 2024, October closed green 10/12 times (only 2014 and 2018 were red). If this month Oct-2025 closes red, that’s 3/13 about 23% odds of a down month. Nice edge, sure, but not destiny.

The seasonal probability 70/30:

In traditional markets, many calendar effects win around 60-70% of the time over long samples, good, but far from guaranteed. Two well studied examples: the Halloween indicator (“Sell in May”) shows higher Nov-Apr returns across many markets, but not every year, updated research still finds persistence, not certainty. Likewise, the turn of the month effect concentrates a big chunk of average monthly return into a few days, yet it also fails regularly. In short, seasonality is probabilistic, think 70/30, not 100/0.

Reality check:

markets don’t care about calendars, they care about cycles, liquidity, and macro. If we’re in a prolonged consolidation (post-halving churn, shifting policy), that \~23% downside month isn’t some anomaly, it’s the cost of playing a probabilistic edge. The log trend can stay intact while October still prints red.

Bottom line:

Use seasonality as context, not a trigger. Based on my risk metric, BTC $109K = risk 48. It's still under 50 and today is Sunday. I'm DCAing in, sticking to my plan.

Not only does this open the route to tax wrappers (sipp / isa) but also provides one of the safest ways to gain exposure if you didn't want to go down the 'control your own keys' route. 

I know that at least 21shares and Wisdomtree btc and eth etps are set to be opened for trading to Retail tomorrow with the rest soon following within days. 

To start with, access will be provided by Interactive Investors, Trading212 and Saxobank with others likely to follow in due course. 

While there has been concern that these products are etns rather than US style etfs, such risks are largely overblown as the products are nonetheless fully backed

https://docs.londonstockexchange.com/sites/default/files/documents/crypto_etn_admission_factsheet.pdf

The reason for Europe and UK using this structure is down to UCITS regulation not allowing etfs with single or concentrated asset underlyings. 

Edit 20/10: Can confirm that I tried in Interactive Investor this morning 20/10 and orders in CBTC were going through. 
T212 strangely gave me a message saying my 24 hour cooling off period was still underway and that i would be able to trade after 30/10.

Edit: T212 now works for me and access to crypto etps is working!

Edit: II is also providing access to Bitwise issued etps on LSE. Of particular note here is ticker ET33. This is far and away the most compelling staked Ethereum etp. Charges 0.65% pa fee and gives you all the staking yield minus 10% staking fee. It's benchmarked to an external Ethereum Total Return Index

https://bitwiseinvestments.eu/de/products/bitwise-ethereum-staking-etp/

Don't be confused. ET33 is just the GBP ticker of the above. 

Edit: Another BTC etp worth looking into. Ticker BTC3 (Bitwise Core Bitcoin etp)
Fee: 0.05% until 31/3/2026 and then reverting to 0.2%

Edit: And finally Blackrock joining the party too with IB1T (note this is not the US IBIT). It's an etp like all others in UK. 0.15% to start with and reverting to 0.25% later. Somewhat higher fees but might appeal to anyone paranoid about issuer default risk. 

Edit 21/10: Apparently 21shares has announced that the fee on CBTC is now a permanent low of 0.1% pa (earlier it was supposed to revert to 0.21% after an year). Check this yourself though as I found only one source that clearly articulates this.

cryptocurrency,1oanbqc,Everyone panicked on October 10… but that’s just crypto being crypto.,hodorrny,2025-10-19T12:31:19,319,0.84,126,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oanbqc/everyone_panicked_on_october_10_but_thats_just/,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1oanbqc/everyone_panicked_on_october_10_but_thats_just/,"everyone freaked out but this is textbook bull market behavior. in every bull run you get 2 to 4 major pullbacks, usually around 30 to 45%. what we saw wasn’t even close to that.

so yeah, it hurts. but it’s not unexpected. it’s not the end of the bull run, it’s part of it.

here’s what actually happened with the tariff stuff

on october 10, trump announced a new 100% tariff on chinese goods. markets freaked out instantly. bitcoin dropped about 8% to roughly $104,782 on oct 10. global stocks and tech megacaps lost over $770 billion in value that day.
it triggered a broad sell off. traders rushed to de risk, and crypto saw huge liquidations… about $16 to $19 billion wiped out in the episode.

but this is the usual cycle. markets panic, then the fed steps in. if the sell-off continues, powell could cut rates to stabilize things. rate cuts mean more liquidity. liquidity pushes crypto back up.
if trade tensions ease or central banks step in with liquidity, markets typically recover. that is the dynamic traders are watching.

the pullback is kind of an opportunity tbh

when people panic sell, that’s usually when you want to buy. panic selling never works long term. if you believed in crypto at $110k, you should love it more at $104k. same asset, cheaper price.

i’ve been holding since 2017. i’ve seen much worse. the people who actually made money weren’t the ones who panic traded… they were the ones who held through the scary dips and kept buying.

here’s the macro math
bitcoin still moves with the global money supply. when liquidity expands, bitcoin rises. when it tightens, it drops. right now, governments can’t afford to tighten too hard without breaking something.
so eventually, more liquidity will come… and that’s when crypto climbs back.


the big picture stays bullish. short term pain, long term trend intact.

don’t use leverage. seriously. that’s how people get wiped. buy dips only with what you can afford to lose. if you panic sold or got liquidated, those are taxable events. capital losses from the dip can offset your gains from earlier in the year, but only if you report them properly. with all the volatility we've seen, tracking every trade manually is a nightmare. that's where tools like awaken.tax actually help… they pull your transaction history and calculate gains/losses automatically so you're not scrambling in april trying to remember what you sold at $104k versus $110k.

every dip feels like the end when you’re in it. then six months later, you regret not buying more.",ANALYSIS,True,,False

With time I totally forgot about it, as I added it to metamask.

Long story short, metamask crashed, i managed to recover other accounts with their keys ... and one of those keys have barely visible words, because that damn ink sunfaded so bad i cant read it.

I managed to get most words using self made image processing algorithms, but three of them are really damaged. I thought i could extract the words as some forms lead to some letters, but I still cant get them right. thee reddit app keeps saying it is not valid.

Is there some open source software that could help ""brute forcing"" those 3 words ? I heard it used to work with 1 missing, but maybe 3 is too much.  and i'd rather not spend my sunday coding that, i spent enough time on it.

There is not much on the wallet, but i'd like to transfer whatever is on it on another wallet, as I saw the vault gets discontinued.

**I got it ! Ended up shining a strong light through the paper and i could finally detect the 2 missing words after guessing the first. Thank you all for your suggestions !**

**If you are ever in a similar situation:**

**1/  shining a strong light helps a lot outlining whatever was left**

**2/  Shining UV is also worth a shot - not too long as it may destroy the remaninging ink and paper.**

Sounded like pie-in-the-sky stuff at the time – hardly any lenders out there, and it felt too good to be true.

Fast forward to now, and the landscape's changed big time! We've got solid options popping up like Firefish, YouHodl, Ledn, Unchained, and even some traditional banks dipping their toes in.

price doesn’t just “move.” it’s guided. structured. delivered.

people talk about “market makers” like they’re some broker in london pressing buy and sell all day.  
but that’s not it. that’s surface-level stuff.

the deeper you go, the more you see it’s not random banks or hedge funds controlling price.  
the real market makers are central banks.  
they’re the ones who *set* the currency price and keep it stable or make it unstable, if that’s what policy calls for.

brokers don’t decide anything.  
dealers quote what’s already been delivered to them.  
we’re all just getting the downstream version of what’s already priced in at the top.

price delivery isn’t emotional. it’s mechanical.  
time and liquidity that’s what drives everything.  
they run algorithms to balance flows, close inefficiencies, and keep the global system from breaking.

that’s why ICT says: price isn’t discovered. it’s delivered

it’s not about manipulation or conspiracy. it’s about precision.  
when the market runs one side of liquidity, rebalances, and expands the other way it’s not chaos.  
it’s how the machine breathes.

you can see it on every chart.  
same patterns. same rhythm. liquidity raid, rebalance, delivery. again and again.  
and we keep thinking it’s “breakouts” or “smart money moves.”

it’s not. it’s system behavior.

once you stop fighting it and start reading it, everything slows down.  
you stop guessing. you stop chasing.  
you wait for the algorithm to do what it’s always done deliver price to where liquidity sits next.

there’s no magic to it. just understanding how the system feeds itself.

the sooner you get that, the calmer you trade.",,True,,False

If you believe the total store of value in the world stay kind of constant, then Bitcoin’s long term math start to look really interesting.

Every four years the halving cut new supply, but that’s not the only thing people forget. People die. Unlike gold or cash, Bitcoin doesn’t recycle when someone passes away. If no one has the private keys, those coins are gone forever.

Already 3 to 4 million BTC are lost for good. Over the next decades more will disappear from forgotten wallets, lost hardware, or people dying without sharing access. It’s not crazy to think another 5 to 8 million could vanish. So when people say “1 BTC = 10 million dollars is impossible,” they use wrong math. They take 21 million coins, multiply by 10 million, and call it absurdly high. But a lot of those coins will never move again. The real supply might be only 10 to 12 million, maybe even less.

At that point 10 million per BTC in today’s value doesn’t sound crazy at all. It’s just the same global value split among fewer coins. Harder money, smaller supply, same store of value. Curious to hear what others think, especially if someone has done deep modeling on long term death-loss supply reduction.

I just want to share my story so feel free to read if you would like :) 

I am a 25 year old male supporting my girlfriend through schooling while working full time and things have been pretty stressful as you might expect. I’ve been in crypto since 2019 and bought into bitcoin ($300) for the first time in 2019. Unfortunately sold that as I really didn’t know much about what I had even bought as I was 17 years old and hearing about people getting rich lol. 

Well, something similar happened to me recently and it has caused me to completely think about many things differently. 

I got into trading meme coins…. Ugh I know. Listen, there are people that can do this professionally and properly and PNL their way up to 100xs and can handle that type of risk management. I definitely CANNOT. And I’ve come to the acceptance that I might never be. And that is OKAY. It was hard seeing so many influencers saying “you are right around the corner” and drawing me back in until I had enough with revenge trading and just gave up on it. 

Man I felt stupid. I had wasted $500 on quite possibly some of the stupidest digital assets money can buy. I lost sleep from this. How could I be so foolish? How could I have lost so much control? How could I risk so much in pursuit of greed? 

I know in the world of trading, 500 might be an entry for some people. For me it just hurt. I felt pushed back in being a good future provider, money management and thinking I had control. I felt like I had nobody to talk to that would understand.

I then started looking back into Bitcoin. I know this sounds like the stupidest thing I could do after what felt like such a heavy loss for me, but for me… it just showed me how broken fiat is… I understood something, financial stability doesn’t come from sweating over absurd parabolic charts, or quickness, or greed. It comes from planing, planting seeds, patience, and being 
resourceful.

I fully believe, as long as the internet is around, Bitcoin will be a literal golden asset. As we see the middle class slowly die, I feel like the future higher wealthier class will be making big deals through Bitcoin, and the rest of the population will be moving to stable DeFi like coins as an adoption of the official currency. It just makes simple sense. And I see it with the rich and their recent attitude towards crypto as a whole. Bitcoin is limited. Bitcoin is simply genius.

Some of you might be rolling your eyes at me, either because I sound nuts, or I’m late to the party. But I’ve started treating the fiat I own differently. If I don’t get a coffee in the morning, I buy Bitcoin. Any money given to me 
For birthdays or Christmas, Bitcoin. Bonuses at work Bitcoin. I’ve started keeping a physical journal of every single Bitcoin purchase I make, the date and the price. To keep track of time periods, to keep my spending in check and to look back on. I’m working on getting 3 separate physical cold wallets and spreading my asset in case if anything happens but at the end of the day I have a really really really positive outlook on this and I really really think this is it. I think this is the asset that sets us up all for a few generations. 

Trading meme coins might have been the stupidest, genius, ridiculous, expensive way to get on this path I’m currently on, but it has given me more optimism, hope, and healthy habits for me and my girlfriends future. 

I’m buying and NEVER selling. 

Love you all and I’m so stoked to be apart of this with you guys.

Not just money, but actual wealth that could compound over their lifetime.

I'm not rich. I don't have some seven-figure salary. But I made a decision about few years ago to stop trying to ""beat the market"" and just... accumulate. Specifically Bitcoin. No trading, no leverage, no trying to time dips perfectly. Just consistent buying.

**Here's what I'm actually doing:**

My goal is 9-10 BTC over the next 15-20 years. At today's prices (\~$115k), that's roughly $1M. But here's the thing, I'm not thinking in dollars. I'm thinking in whole coins. Five years ago you'd have needed 90 BTC for the same dollar goal. Today it is 10 BTC, and in another five years, maybe 1 BTC will be enough. The point is **owning the asset**, not chasing a dollar target that inflates away.

I set aside a fixed percentage of my income every month. Some months it's painful. Car repairs happen, medical bills come up. But I've learned that if I skip even one month, it breaks the rhythm and I never catch back up.

**The two things that almost derailed me:**

1. **Fear when the portfolio grew:** Once I hit about 40% of my goal, the volatility started to *hurt*. Waking up to a 20% drop feels different when it's real money you've been building for years. I had to retrain my brain: drops mean I get to stack more sats for cheaper. Still working on that mindset honestly.
2. **Boredom around the initial months:** The process is boring as hell in the beginnings. It's not exciting. There's no dopamine hit like trading gives you. I got tempted to ""just try"" a 5x long. Didn't do it, but the urge was real. Consistency is way harder than I thought it'd be.

I'm not saying this is the only way or even the right way. I'm not a financial advisor and I'm definitely not telling anyone what to do with their money. But for me, the question became: what's the point of gambling my way to a short-term gain if I lose it all on the next bad trade? I'd rather **own** something I can't get liquidated out of.

My kids are still very young. They won't touch this for 15-20 years. That time horizon changes everything.

**For other parents here:** Are you doing anything similar? Or do you think this is too risky/naive? Genuinely curious if anyone else is taking this ""boring consistency"" approach or if I'm just coping.",,True,,False

But with the rise of ETFs by large institutions and the demand for them, it might also be a good thing for crypto since more money is entering the system.

So one group of people we have self custody, advocating safekeeping own seedphrase in hot/cold wallets, and another group of people do not want to be responsible in safeguarding their seeds but still ride on the price volatility with some management fees.

Many also, usually beginners/active traders/small bag owners tend to keep some crypto with exchanges. So I was thinking with the rise in scams and the risk of CEX collapsing, are there a group of people that are willing to transfer their crypto into their own hardware wallet but allow a company/platform to securely hold their seeds? Lets say this platform is credible, approved by authorities, insured up to certain limits, storing your seeds in multiple places and encrypted, seeds only retrievable via user password & biometrics, would there be trust and adoption  in it? If yes, this will likely open up crypto to more people in the world whom previously didn’t dare to explore this space. 

I am a strong believer that 1 day we can have a robust system that can protect ourselves from scams. Tech advancement is making scammers drain wallets easily, of course it needs some social engineering too which education needs to play a part. But a good system can protect people before fraudulent activities hit them.

On an another note, close to 20% of all BTC might be lost forever. Usually its due to seedphrase missing. I was also wondering if people die suddenly without written will, then their children will never know the seeds unlike traditional banking where authorities or the law can possibly process the inheritance. Will this promote third party securing seeds for people?

Curious if there is a group of people that will want to securely share their seedphrase with a trusted platform? Too many scams now, hoping to see if anything can be done to protect adopters and hopefully encourage more people into crypto without worrying about losing their seeds.",,True,,False

bitcoin,1ojfedc,I want to start up a business that will help society with Bitcoin adoption.,hitma-n,2025-10-29T21:18:39,2,0.6,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ojfedc/i_want_to_start_up_a_business_that_will_help/,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ojfedc/i_want_to_start_up_a_business_that_will_help/,"So I think I’m finally pulling the plug on my 9-5 and thinking to start a business most likely early next year.

I consider myself very well educated in finance and fundamentals of Bitcoin so I thought I’ll focus on this for my start-up.

I do not want to start mining or start another crypto exchange. What I want to so is address some frictions I’ve seen in the Bitcoin usability that prevents its widespread adoption.

Some of the frictions I’ve seen are these;

1. Refunds for transactions. I don’t find any optimal way for merchants to process refunds when a customer returns their product. I see opportunity to build an automated payment system to process this. This system could make use of LN or Base.

2. The transaction invoice generated by many merchants is too technical for a normal person to understand. Need to find a way to simplify this, a universally uniform invoice.

3. Complexity of self-custody. Lots of people are nervous thinking they’d lose their keys or access to wallet. They’re so used to reaching out to the bank if they lose access to their bank accounts, who do they reach out to if they lose access to Bitcoin?

However, this is more of an educational opportunity than something I can do to fix. I see opportunity in an academia based start up purely to teach.

4. The complexity of wallet addresses. The chain of code where we are required to cross-check and double check to confirm if we’re sending to the right address causes anxiety to even a Bitcoin veteran like me let alone a layman. However some businesses have already come up with linking these addresses to human-readable names. There’s still more opportunity to leverage this though.

“I am Free Market Maximum” is not just an economic statement — it’s a philosophy of life.

I believe in the freedom to choose, personal responsibility, and value defined by voluntary exchange, not by authority, centralization, or protectionism.

In a world where many seek safety nets, I choose risk for freedom.
While others crave stability, I seek the truth of value — where supply meets demand, where people exchange through trust and creativity, not coercion.

1. The Free Market Is the Test of Truth

The free market isn’t perfect, but it’s more honest than any institution.
It reflects what people truly want, what they’re willing to trade, and what they genuinely believe in.
No central plan can replicate the logic of millions of voluntary choices.

2. Value Is Not Granted — It Is Created

No one gives you value.
You create it — through work, creativity, and commitment.
To live as a Free Market Maximum is to reject victimhood, refuse to blame, and choose self-reliance over dependency.

3. Freedom Is the Highest Form of Ethics

When every transaction is voluntary, no one is coerced — that’s the highest moral order.
In a free market, you don’t need power to have influence — only to create real value.

4. Bitcoin — The Symbol of Maximum Freedom

No central bank.
No coercive authority.
Only the natural laws of supply and demand, energy and scarcity, trust and value.
Bitcoin stands as the purest expression of Free Market Maximum — where freedom, ethics, and technology converge into a new order.

---

I am Free Market Maximum.
I live by the value I create.
I choose freedom over comfort.
And I believe that — in a truly free world — ethics, creativity, and individual capability are the strongest currencies of all.

Despite BTC trading within a tight $70K-$112K range, regulated ETFs are absorbing billions. This inflow-price paradox confirms institutional capital is building a foundational bid wall, not chasing speculative momentum.

The core conviction is that patient institutional money is systematically reducing the available supply pool. 

1) The Basis Trade Collapse: Hedge funds systemically exited spot ETF holdings after the lucrative ""basis trade"" premium collapsed. This means the capital entering now from wealth managers is strategic, buy-and-hold allocation, not short-term arbitrage.

2) The Supply Sink: The sustained absorption of billions without a proportional price spike confirms that institutional capital is establishing a massive, standing bid wall, creating a ""coiling spring"" effect.

3) Whale Liquidity Transfer: Early Bitcoin whales are actively selling into this institutional strength. This transfer provides the necessary liquidity for ETFs to establish deep positions, confirming wealth is moving from early holders to regulated institutions.

The market is coiling. Is the current price stagnation the final phase of a deliberate institutional supply acquisition, or is the short-term macro uncertainty still too high to justify maintaining this standing bid wall?",,True,,False

I'm in a bit of a pickle.

Some years ago I took a loan because I was given a business opportunity which required around $40.000

As you could imagine the business was a flop and I was $40.000 in debt. I have since then paid back little by little and now it's around $18.000. 

My girlfriend and I have been looking at houses because we feel it's a bit too small the one we're currently living in (renting) and I've found one where we have to pay $15.000 as a down payment.

However. I'm unsure whether I should use my holdings in crypto to pay off the loan of $18.000 or if I should use my crypto to make the down payment for a mortgage loan. Or just keep going as I've done til now, pay off the loan little by little and throw more into crypto and slowly build up a bigger saving.

I'm leaning towards paying off the loan. That'll release $500/month which I would be able to invest back into crypto on top of my current monthly deposits.

💡 Money Moves to Opportunity, But Wealth Moves to Scarcity

In every economic cycle, money behaves like water — it flows wherever opportunity appears.
When people see a booming market, new trend, or viral project, money rushes in. It’s fast, emotional, and speculative. That’s what money does — it seeks opportunity.

But wealth plays a different game.
Wealth doesn’t chase; it waits. It doesn’t seek where everyone runs to; it settles where few can enter.
True wealth understands one timeless law: value emerges where scarcity exists.

When something becomes scarce — time, land, energy, or a truly limited digital asset — wealth migrates there quietly, long before the crowd notices.
That’s why wealth always feels “patient,” even when markets feel chaotic. It’s not because the wealthy are smarter — it’s because they understand scarcity creates permanence, while opportunity often fades.

Bitcoin, art, ideas, and reputation — these are not about chasing opportunities; they are about owning what can’t be replicated.
Money moves in herds.
Wealth moves in silence.

So next time you see everyone chasing the next “opportunity,” pause and ask:
👉 Is this abundant hype — or rare truth?

Because in the end, money moves fast,
but wealth moves wisely — toward scarcity.

bitcoin,1oix1co,Bitcoin and AI: Two Sides of the Same Coin,vhtech99,2025-10-29T07:14:27,0,0.25,7,https://i.redd.it/4my9onmhtzxf1.png,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1oix1co/bitcoin_and_ai_two_sides_of_the_same_coin/,"🧠⚡ Bitcoin and AI: Two Sides of the Same Coin

While AI is redefining how humans create knowledge, Bitcoin is redefining how we build trust.
Two technologies that seem to stand on opposite ends — one focused on artificial intelligence, the other on personal sovereignty — are in fact two sides of the same coin: the automation of trust and intelligence.

---

1️⃣ AI: Automating Thought

AI turns human thinking into mathematical models.
It learns from data, predicts behaviors, and optimizes processes — from language and images to decision-making.
AI expands creative capacity and accelerates humanity’s intellectual progress.

However, AI depends on data centers, control, and trust.
Users must believe that the model isn’t manipulated and that their data isn’t being abused.
In other words, AI is a powerful tool, but it still operates on a human layer of trust — something inherently fragile.

---

2️⃣ Bitcoin: Automating Trust

Bitcoin takes the opposite direction.
It doesn’t predict the future — it redefines how we trust.
Instead of relying on banks, governments, or institutions, Bitcoin encodes trust in open-source code and decentralized consensus.

Bitcoin doesn’t need intelligence — it needs honesty through rules.
And because it cannot be bribed, it becomes the first truly trustless system in human history.

---

3️⃣ Together: Intelligence + Integrity

AI creates prediction.
Bitcoin creates assurance.
When these two forces converge, we get the foundation of an autonomous society — where decisions come from data but are protected by transparency.

AI without Bitcoin = intelligence without ethics.
Bitcoin without AI = truth without scalability.

The future belongs to systems that can think like AI and stay honest like Bitcoin.

---

⚙️ 4️⃣ The Philosophical Parallel

Both are inevitable outcomes of evolution:

Bitcoin — a response to the collapse of trust in institutions.

AI — a response to the cognitive overload of humanity.

One frees humans from the need to trust.
The other frees humans from the limits of cognition.

And when they converge, they give rise to Civilization 2.0 — where humanity no longer relies on intermediaries but interacts directly through networks of truth and intelligence.

---

🚀 Conclusion

If AI is the brain of the new world,
then Bitcoin is its heart.

One learns to understand humans.
The other teaches humans to stay honest.

AI + Bitcoin = Autonomous Civilization.
A civilization that learns, operates, and evolves on its own — beyond manipulation or control.

But maybe it was created to show us what the system really is.

When I first learned about Bitcoin, I thought it was just digital gold.
Something you buy, hold, and hope goes up.
Then you spend a few years watching how it moves, how the world reacts to it and you realize it’s not just a currency.
It’s a signal. A mirror.
And what it’s showing us is uncomfortable.


🌍 The system we live in runs on belief

Fiat money isn’t backed by gold, productivity, or even logic — it’s backed by confidence.
It works because everyone agrees to keep pretending it does.
Central banks print, governments borrow, and we keep working because we have to.
It’s an illusion that survives by keeping everyone too busy to question it.

When you zoom out, you see that the entire economy depends on debt expansion.
Every “solution” is more of the same lower rates, bigger deficits, larger bubbles.
The system doesn’t create value; it redistributes trust.

That’s why Bitcoin matters.
It doesn’t fix the world, but it forces it to be honest.
It’s the first monetary system that doesn’t rely on belief only math.

⛓ Bitcoin doesn’t care

Every ten minutes, a block gets mined.
No meetings.
No politicians.
No policy decisions.

It doesn’t care who’s in charge or what the headlines say.
There are no “emergency measures.” No printing button.
Just the same code, running exactly as it did in 2009.

That consistency is the point.
It’s not trying to outperform fiat it’s showing what sound money looks like when no one is allowed to touch it.

People call Bitcoin volatile, but volatility is just transparency.
For the first time, you’re watching a market breathe without filters.
There’s no “stabilization,” no manipulation to make the chart look calm.
Every tick is real belief forming and collapsing in real time.

🕯 The quiet honesty of math

In 2009, when the first block was mined, it carried a simple message:

“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”



That wasn’t random. It was a timestamp  proof of why this thing exists.
It was a message to anyone paying attention:
Money had become political.
Bitcoin was built to make it mathematical again.

It doesn’t demand trust. It replaces it.
You don’t have to believe anyone.
You can verify everything yourself down to the last sat.

That’s why so many people who start trading it end up studying it.
Because once you understand what Bitcoin is actually doing keeping score, fairly, forever  the rest of finance starts looking like theatre.

⏳ Bitcoin is patience in motion

Every four years, the block reward halves.
The supply tightens.
The noise increases.
And yet, the chain keeps moving forward at the same rhythm, as if nothing’s happening.

No matter what markets do, it keeps time.
That’s its real power not speed, not hype, not profit.
Time itself is the foundation.

Everything in the modern economy bends to emotion quarterly earnings, political cycles, central bank reactions.
Bitcoin doesn’t bend. It ticks.

🔍 What it really teaches

Bitcoin isn’t just technology.
It’s a stress test for human belief.
It shows how little most people actually understand about value, scarcity, and trust.
And it proves that a financial system doesn’t need a central authority just rules that no one can break.

It’s not a rebellion.
It’s a reflection of what sound money was supposed to be all along.
No promises. No speeches. No interference.

Just code, time, and math working quietly while the rest of the world argues about headlines.

Bitcoin won’t fix human greed or bad policy.
But it will outlast both.
Because honesty, once discovered, doesn’t go away.

I am not interested in any other crypto currencies only BTC.

Also before I say more, I am just getting started so please don't lynch me if I get anything wrong.

I’ve been looking at Revolut X, since it offers quite low trading fees at around 0.09%. However, something on their website confused me. They say that users don’t actually hold their BTC directly instead, it’s held by a trusted custodian. At the same time, they claim that all assets are held on a 1:1 basis and that nothing is ever lent out.

Maybe I’m misunderstanding this, but isn’t one of the main selling points of BTC the fact that you actually own it on the blockchain? That way, you can withdraw your BTC to your own wallet whenever you want, without worrying about what’s happening behind the scenes. If Revolut X keeps control of the coins, doesn’t that go against that idea?

Given that, would I be better off using another exchange, like Binance, which also offers low fees but might give me more control over my BTC?",,True,,False

Curious what others think about this framework. The full paper goes deeper into key management, asset protection, and governance. But this part in the abstract stood out to me:  
  
**Excerpt:**  
  
""Bitcoin has established its superiority as a generational store of value. The concept of sovereignty must mature beyond unilateral control of cryptographic private keys to an upgraded, more complete form of sovereignty. Upgraded sovereignty contemplates using resilient, legally-recognized ownership regimes, and exploiting opportunities in favorable jurisdictions to achieve tax efficiency, asset protection, robust privacy, and inheritance preservation.  
  
An evolved approach to key management is not contrary to bitcoin’s value as a peer-to-peer medium of exchange. Rather, it’s a recognition that bitcoin’s superior design as a form of money gives it a tendency to rise indefinitely in terms of fiat currencies and as such, warrants thoughtful treatment and structure in societies governed by laws. 

Bitcoin remains a reliable medium of exchange for value in transactions over the internet and otherwise among users. But it also serves as an unmatched store of value as demand increases and as fiat debasement persists; “sats” go farther than they ever did before. 

So long as bitcoin is subject to the tax laws of various nations and until those who inherit large sums of value in wealth can reliably manage that wealth without risk of mismanagement or other permanent loss, holders of significant wealth in bitcoin must evolve their thinking when it comes to managing their holdings.""",,True,,False

So instead, I will share what I have learned so far here. I made many mistakes years ago - the same one others did. Sold some BTC when I thought ""hey, I made money, I'll sell some!"" (duh). I also did that stupid shit of thinking I could gain more by investing in crypto/shitcoins. Lessons learned...but here we are.

  
My Wife and I want to do a kitchen remodel. We have no debt (other than house), and I am not a fan of living in debt. I researched HELOC, Personal loans, etc. Our credit is stellar so that wasn't an issue. But I kept running in to ""questionable"" things that I just didn't feel good about. 

  
Instead, I moved some BTC from cold storage to Coinbase and applied for their loan there (which is provided by Morpho). The APR they offered was 7.52% (but this changes, so you will want to keep an eye on it). The process was \*insanely\* easy and the money was in my account in seconds. I also figure out that if you keep a balance in USDC on Coinbase, it pays 4% APR, so I am doing that to offset the APR of the loan. 

  
I created a google sheet you all can use/copy to model your own scenario: [BTC Loan Calc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HcvBW2i88VQq9r1z7_JgKeRyJMGMnoVk8SDw2I5rLXs/edit?usp=sharing)

In my case, BTC would have to fall to \~$60k for the loan to liquidate, and that assumes I made no payments on the loan. I also have enough liquid cash/btc that if I ""had to"" I could quickly pay the loan down so that it doesn't liquidate. So it's not a huge risk for me. Instead, this was more about ""how can I avoid paying taxes"" and instead **do what the 1% do and just leverage assets**.

I've also added a section to the spreadsheet on ""What if I take the loan and use that to buy more BTC"". This may be a risk you are willing to take, but you need to closely watch the LTV and make sure you are making payments on the loan to keep the LTV down.

This setup forces a potential wrench attacker to find and access multiple locations but will most likely find a new target with less risk

Also memorize the full 24 as a last-resort escape plan if you ever need to leave in a hurry.

* Bitcoin remains the top payment method in 2025, accounting for 22.7% of all transactions.
* In the 2022 bear market, BTC payment volume still grew by 41.7%.
* Since 2018, 6% of BTC payments have been made via Lightning. This year, LN accounts for 11.7% of all Bitcoin transactions.
* People mostly spend BTC on hosting, consumer services, and VPNs, where borderless payments matter most.
* The average order size is €132, from small services to high-value purchases like travel and tech.
* 25.9% of merchants now keep the BTC they receive instead of exchanging it, the highest share since 2022.

Hey HODLers and crypto curious, need your take! A friend’s asking if they should jump into Bitcoin at ~$114K. I’m torn feels like a dip worth buying (RSI oversold, small wallets stacking sats like crazy), but $100K+ prices scream “too late” to newbies. On-chain shows accumulation, ETF inflows are steady, and some X posts predict $130K soon or even $200K by EOY. But others say wait for a sub-$110K test.
•  Long-term (5+ years): Is it still “early” for BTC?
•  Short-term: Buy now or wait for a bigger dip?
•  What’d you tell a newbie DCA, lump sum, or hold off?

Or about $2.4k - $3.6k per week to get to 1 BTC in 1 year.	

**Methodology:**

To get to this answer over multiple time frames in the future ranging from 1-5 years, I first ran a monte carlo simulation to generate 5000 future price paths for BTC.

This is the core engine of our simulation. 

I then took the average returns of the bottom 50%, all the price paths and the top 10% price paths. This gives us a low, average and high expectation.   
These results can be seen in the table below.

I think concluding you need to DCA :  
\- $1k per week to get there in 5 years

\- $1.5k per week for 2-3 years

\- $2.5k+ per week for 1 year 

Would be fair. I recommend to look at the numbers in all 3 columns though. 

The main thing that I learnt from this would be that **we are getting priced out of Bitcoin very fast**.

How Human Minds Drive Markets, Not Numbers

At its core, the economy is not a machine of money — it’s a machine of minds. Prices, markets, booms, and crashes are not born from equations but from human emotions: hope, fear, trust, and desire.

Every currency is a collective belief. Every transaction is an act of faith. When we say “the economy grows,” what we really mean is that people believe tomorrow will be better than today. When they lose that belief, recession begins — long before the numbers confirm it.

Psychology is the engine; money is merely the fuel.
Governments print money, but they cannot print trust. Central banks can raise interest rates, but they cannot raise confidence.

This is why narrative matters more than policy.
A nation’s economy rises when its people share a story of progress — that effort leads to reward, that innovation is worth the risk, that the future is open. Without that shared story, even abundant capital stagnates.

The greatest economists are, in essence, psychologists who understand mass behavior.
The greatest investors are storytellers who know how to align capital with conviction.

So if you want to understand the economy, don’t just look at charts — look at people.
Markets move not when data changes, but when minds do.

Something like ""hyperbitcoinization happens when 1 BTC can buy a house"". It's a nice thought, but it's superficial. It's a comparison of prices, and prices are just noise.

The real point of no return is not about price. It's about proof of work. It's the moment our civilization decides it is more important to expend the energy to create one new Bitcoin than it is to expend the energy to build one new house.

To build a house, you need a certain amount of energy. You need energy to forge the steel, mix the concrete, cut the lumber, and power the tools that put it all together. This is the proof of work for a physical home. This cost is relatively stable.

To create a Bitcoin, you need a certain amount of energy. You need electricity to power the ASICs that guess trillions of hashes per second. This is the PoW for absolutely scarce money. This cost is designed to do one thing: go up forever. Why?

2 reasons: 1, the difficulty adjustment means that as more people compete to mine, the work gets harder. And 2, the halving means that every 4 years, the reward for the same amount of work gets cut in half.

The trajectory is set. The cost of building a house is a flat line. The cost of mining a Bitcoin is a line on an unstoppable, exponential ascent. These two lines are on a collision course. I don't know exactly when, since I don't know how to track global housing construction costs and global bitcoin mining costs. But I know it's very near. The ""point of no return"" is the moment those two lines cross. It's the moment that the real world energy cost to secure one new block on the chain becomes greater than the real world energy cost to build a new home for a family.

When that day comes, it's not a matter of market sentiment or speculation. It is a fundamental, physical signal from the global economy. Like myself, construction workers won't be able to track the exact date, but the free market will tell them where to find work. There will be a lot more jobs in the bitcoin mining industry. Everything will slowly lead to the moment when market forces recognize that the most important thing we can build is not another physical structure, but another immutable block of truth on a new, incorruptible monetary network.

The overwhelming majority of people are completely asleep right now, including many that are even in this space. Some people are thinking it can't go much higher, that it's a ponzi or that it will never hit 1 million $.

I'm going to break down some of the major variables at play.

Supply- We all know about the 21 million that will ever be mined. Right now, we are sitting at just under 20 million coins total, 19.94 million as I'm writing this. Out of this number, 3-4 million have been permanently lost. People now are buying and holding this asset with a longer term view and this will stay off the market, whereas in past cycles people were treating BTC as a swing trade. After the 2032 halving, the  new supply to the market will be very low and from there will rapidly turn into barely more than a trickle with the halvings in decades after.

Demand- This is where there are so many different variables at play that people do not fully understand.

As I'm writing this, the market cap of Bitcoin is sitting a little under 2.3 trillion USD. The question some have is how does Bitcoin do a 10x or a 100x from here potentially. While this isn't realistic in the shorter term, given enough time the potential is insane.

Global net worth- A simple google search shows that in 2024 GNW hit 470 trillion, we'll just say 450-500 trillion. In 2024 that net worth that increased approximately 4.6%. From 2010 to 2023 it was increasing at a rate of 4.5% per year. With a conservative number, we could say that year by year it could average 4%, 18-20 trillion $ per year. If even just a fraction of this increase in net worth makes its way into BTC, the potential for a price increase is insane.

The question is, how does this happen?

ETFs and Michael Saylor are showing no signs of slowing down. A small number of companies are starting to copy Microstrategy's play book and many more will begin to do this as well in the coming years. Tradfi is in the early stages of getting involved and it will be normal for 401ks and other funds to allocate a percentage into BTC. This will do nothing but continue to grow in the coming years.

Real estate is another major sector that I think will see some major changes. Big investment companies during COVID were buying up single family properties and land in many growing metros/states across the U.S. Phoenix, DFW, Florida, Las Vegas, etc. However, real estate requires taxes, maintenance costs, etc. I could see big money players showing more interest in BTC as a form of ""digital real estate"" where the potential for profit is substantially higher than what real estate could ever offer. I could imagine this scenario being beneficial for the average person where real estate moves away from being an investment tool to being what it is supposed to be, which is a place for a family to live.

Nation states getting involved is a huge variable as well. The U.S will end up creating a BTC reserve, but I do NOT think it is going to hit it's target of 1 million BTC. There are several other nations that have and will show interest in this, Kazakhstan is one recent example. Eventually, nations across the globe will collectively show interest in creating BTC reserves.

The demand is going to do nothing but increase while the supply is rapidly decreasing = incredible price action.",,True,,False

It’s kinda like a mini crypto 529 plan per him.

He also said that through a loophole, he can gift the money to his kid, and then transfer it in to avoid the income cap. Sketch, but seems legal based on Google.

$2K per year is not a ton for college savings - but he did the math and said it comes out to $400k per child (wtf?!) in 17 years assuming 26% annual btc appreciation (it’s averaged 49% over last 10 years). 

However, it’s a pain to setup and requires lots of documentation - so not sure it’s worth it.

It’s been unusually quiet.. almost *suppressed?* Historically, we’d be deep into the parabolic phase of the 4-year cycle by now, but instead, Bitcoin seems to be held back.

Here’s my theory:  
We might be witnessing deliberate suppression by powerful players, the kind of “elites” who understand Bitcoin’s long-term potential and want to ensure that *most people never get to own much of it*.

Think about it, it’s now Q4 2025, and everyone’s expecting a market top soon. Many holders are probably planning to sell, expecting a brutal bear market in 2026 (just like in past cycles). Meanwhile, the Fed is pivoting, lowering rates and ending QT.

So what happens?  
If Bitcoin doesn’t go parabolic by the end of this year, a lot of people will lose faith. They’ll sell, sit on the sidelines, and wait for a “classic” 50–60% drop next year to buy back in cheaper.

But what if that drop *never comes*?

What if, instead, early 2026 is when Bitcoin *finally* takes off, breaking far above $200k when most retail investors are out of the market, expecting a bear? By then, the big players (who’ve been quietly accumulating) will already hold massive positions. They won’t let Bitcoin dump again because they know it’s the future of money and they’ll want to control the scarce supply before it becomes completely out of reach for regular people.

So maybe 2025’s “boring” price action is the setup. The real move might start when everyone’s least expecting it, right after most people sell.

bitcoin,1ogsvzn,Buffered ETF play for Bitcoin exposure,Kismetmania,2025-10-26T20:02:12,0,0.2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ogsvzn/buffered_etf_play_for_bitcoin_exposure/,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ogsvzn/buffered_etf_play_for_bitcoin_exposure/,"Due to recent regulation changes in my country, taking new positions in spot Bitcoin ETFs (like $IBIT, $FBTC, et al.) is barred. And, owning Bitcoin in cold storage seems a hassle I would prefer to avoid.

As such, I have currently identified two possible instruments to fulfill my requirements for crypto exposure:

# 1. ETFs on Crypto Proxy Indices

ETFs holding crypto-miners or digital asset stocks, such as $BITQ, $WGMI, etc.

# 2. Structured/Synthetic ETFs

Funds/ETFs using options, futures, or other derivatives that are not flagged as ""1:1 Bitcoin ETFs"" in my jurisdiction such as buffered ETFs or floor ETFs.

I believe Structured ETFs would be the best bet to achieve the most faithful, direct exposure to Bitcoin's price movement, as Crypto Proxy Indices ($BITQ, etc.) seem to have a much higher beta (though I am not closed to a mixed allocation).

One ETF I have earmarked for now is $QBF (Innovator Uncapped Bitcoin 20 Floor ETF - Quarterly Series)

It seems the most promising since it has the following characteristics:

|Feature|Details|
|:-|:-|
|**Downside Protection**|A **20% Floor**. I cannot lose more than 20% of the underlying Bitcoin index's loss in any quarter (before fees and expenses).|
|**Upside Structure**|**Uncapped** (The major advantage over competitors).|
|**Participation Rate**|For every 1% gain in the underlying Bitcoin index, I receive approx 0.71% of the gain. This reduced sensitivity is the trade-off for establishing the 20% floor. The floor and participation rates are subject to change every quarter.|

I have ruled out offerings from other providers like Calamos and First Trust, as they seem to offer only a limited, hard-capped upside (e.g., max gain of 30%) in exchange for a very generous floor.

# The Questions

For those who are familiar with these Defined Outcome/Structured ETFs, whether on Bitcoin or other indices like the Nasdaq/S&P 500, I have a few specific concerns:

1. I have read on various forums about these being viewed as poor investments (similar to the skepticism often aimed at covered call or high-dividend ETFs). Is this reputation warranted for $QBF?
2. Hidden Costs: Will I be unknowingly shot in the foot by any hidden 'fee' or the cost of outlaying this options strategy that I am not getting now? Is there any case of ETF provider taking a cut of the upside that my layman brain has not understood yet?
3. For those who have taken positions in $QBF or similar uncapped ETFs (like those tracking Nasdaq or S&P), how have they performed? Are the real-world returns faithful to the mechanics outlined in the prospectus?
4. Are there any other uncapped structured/buffered Bitcoin ETFs that you believe would be a superior choice to $QBF for my usecase?",,True,,False

bitcoin,1ogllf4,The Bitcoin Whitepaper Footnotes — Part 1,Fiach_Dubh,2025-10-26T15:10:42,18,0.91,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ogllf4/the_bitcoin_whitepaper_footnotes_part_1/,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ogllf4/the_bitcoin_whitepaper_footnotes_part_1/,"**Examining Satoshi's References and beyond for breadcrumbs** 

Recently I've been diving down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, reading the Whitepaper references. My goal is to get a sense of what Satoshi was thinking about at the time, and how they arrived at their invention of Bitcoin from these eight cited sources.

[https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/bitcoin.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/pz9b116krgxf1.jpg?width=926&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d76dd1b9991c98236c69c469421b82c884c4d898)

There were likely other sources of inspiration that contributed to Satoshi's invention of Bitcoin, such as the references within the 8 Whitepaper footnotes, or other academic publications before 2009.

If you want to get a head start on this series, I've done a few twitter threads analyzing most of the 8 footnotes. The plan is to more formally review these threads, and include two more reviews looking at b-money by Wei Dai\[1\], and an interesting theory about these references that was recently put forward by Stornetta\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]. Stornetta is one of the godfathers behind timestamp servers.

Through this review, it became evident the primary people of interest are Adam Back, Scott Stornetta & Stuart Haber, and Henri Massias. Stornetta and Haber are cited multiple times for their foundational works on timestamp servers. While Adam Back is cited for his proof work paper. Meanwhile, Massias is the outlier, being an unknown name in the field of timestamp servers, which suggests something subtle.

By reading through these papers, it became evident that Bitcoin is a distributed timestamp server driven by a proof of work mechanism that fairly distributes the ""money"" of that server in such a way that aligns incentives for the parties involved. A Nash equilibrium emerges through this fly wheel of value creation via a consistent issuance schedule lottery on a permission-less, global, open source, censorship resistant timestamp ledger. 

All these pieces were floating around in these papers and elsewhere before 2009. It appears Satoshi was simply the first to amalgamate these into a working digital bank. Thus, Satoshi's innovation was in creating a chimera hydra of a timestamp server powered by a p2p proof of work incentive mechanism.

bull run, bear market, manipulation, whales, etf…. same noise every cycle.

but here’s the thing bitcoin doesn’t care.
it doesn’t need your belief or your doubt.
blocks keep coming every ten minutes, with or without you.

i’ve seen this thing crash 80% and everyone said “it’s over.”
then it comes back stronger. not because of hype,
but because every time fiat gets printed, bitcoin’s code looks smarter.

it’s not perfect. it’s not a get-rich ticket.
it’s just consistent.
no politics. no meetings. no press releases.

and that consistency exposes everything else that isn’t.
that’s the real reason i hold it. not for profit.
for peace of mind.

No bailouts. No central bank smoothing the charts. Just raw, visible truth.

Traditional assets get rescued, inflated, or “revalued.”
Bitcoin can’t be patched over like that every tick, every change, every rule is transparent.

It doesn’t “beat” inflation.
It simply refuses to play that game.
Its monetary policy is fixed no one can print more, ever.

Every four years, new supply gets cut in half.
2012. 2016. 2020. 2024.
Less new Bitcoin, same or higher demand the math does the rest.

And like clockwork, every cycle repeats:
governments dismiss it → media mocks it → institutions quietly buy it → the public rushes in late → everything resets.

No promises. No yield. No central control.
Just a network enforcing scarcity every ten minutes, for everyone, forever.

That’s what makes it dangerous to systems built on dilution and debt.
Bitcoin doesn’t ask for trust. It earns it with math and time.

It won’t make everyone rich.

I'm excited to introduce you to a project we're launching here in Tenerife, Spain: the Tenerife Bitcoin Market.

This isn't just a list of businesses that accept Bitcoin. This is a dedicated, physical market that happens once a month, where the primary currency is Bitcoin.

🌴 What is the Tenerife Bitcoin Market?

A Physical Marketplace: A monthly event where you can buy fresh local produce, art, coffee, books, and services directly with Bitcoin.

Mission: To create a real-world ecosystem and demonstrate Bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange, not just a store of value. We're building a circular bitcoin economy on the island.

Core Values: Decentralization, financial sovereignty, and strengthening the local community.

🛍 What Can You Do There?

As a Visitor: Come to learn, make your first Bitcoin purchase, enjoy local products, and connect with the community. There are even educational talks.

As a Merchant: (For just €5) Get a stall, technical support, and access to the community to sell your products/services for Bitcoin.

📅 Practical Details:

Next Event: Saturday, November 15, 2025

Hours: 10:00 - 14:00

Frequency: Once a month

Location: Onda Aguere - Radio Geneto, Camino de Las Viñas, La Laguna, Tenerife.


Why This Matters:

We believe the true power of Bitcoin is unlocked when we can use it in our daily lives. This market is a practical step towards that future—a place where ""orange-pilling"" happens naturally through real commerce.

We'd love for the broader community to:

I went through a recap on Fundemehtals,  white paper , macro Econ inflation and debasement, opsec and self custody 

I told her she’s gaining my 7 years of knowledge (MORE than saylor’s 100 hours )  just by me spoon feeding her the knowledge - she appreciated that 

Now she’s watching bitcoin videos with me instead of dozing off when I try to explain. It’s wonderful to finally have a bitcoin buddy with me. She’s actually the one initiating the videos to watch with me.  ….  now I have a partner instead of sneaking around and dumping tax refund check into it without being seen etc

- I told her my plans to retire early  in 6 years (52) when my daughter turns 18 and move out of my tax-to death state and go to Florida. First downsizing from our expensive house (10k property tax etc ) She says your dreaming how will you survive , even after the downsize ? That’s when I showed her everything , and now we’re a team on it and I’m enjoying that camaraderie

Let's break it down.

**The ""Keys"" = Your 12 or 24-word ""seed phrase.""** This phrase is the password that *is* your money.

# The Analogy: A Bank vs. Cash in Your Pocket

**1. Keeping Bitcoin on an Exchange (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken):**

* This is like leaving your money in a **bank**.
* You log in and the bank's website *shows* you a balance. ""You have $1,000.""
* But do you *really*? The bank is just holding an IOU for you.
* The bank controls the vault. They can freeze your account, get hacked, or go bankrupt (see: FTX, Celsius).
* If the bank fails, your money is gone.
* **Conclusion: You don't have the keys. Those are not your coins.**

**2. Keeping Bitcoin in a Self-Custody Wallet (Trezor, Ledger, Muun, BlueWallet):**

* This is like holding **physical cash (or gold) in your own personal safe** at home.
* You, and *only* you, have the key (your 12/24 word phrase).
* It's 100% *your* responsibility. If you lose your key (seed phrase), your money is gone forever. If someone steals your key, your money is gone forever.
* But... no bank, government, or hacker can *ever* touch it without that key. It is 100% *yours*.
* **Conclusion: These are your keys. These are your coins.**

**So, what should you do?**

It's okay to *buy* on an exchange. But you shouldn't *store* your life savings there.

Your goal as a beginner should be to buy a small amount, learn, and then practice moving it to a simple, self-custody ""hot wallet"" (an app on your phone).

Once you're comfortable and your investment grows, your next step is a ""cold wallet"" (a hardware device like a Trezor or Ledger).

Welcome to financial sovereignty. It's a big responsibility, but it's the whole point.",,True,,False

This relief is immediately paired with a strict new audit burden, locking Bitcoin into the formal corporate compliance infrastructure.

The core conviction is that regulatory clarity on tax liability is the final structural seal of approval for Bitcoin. Knowledge is the real flex here.

1) Existential Tax Threat Removed: The U.S. Treasury granted an exemption clarifying that unrealized gains on digital asset holdings will be exempt from the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. This removes the existential 15% phantom tax liability that deterred corporate treasuries.

2) Mandatory Corporate Disclosure: The IRS has expanded mandatory disclosure of digital assets to all corporate, partnership, and trust forms. This formalizes the compliance burden on all corporate entities holding BTC.

3) Accounting Volatility Challenge: Despite the CAMT relief, mark-to-market accounting injects substantial volatility into reported earnings for Bitcoin treasuries. This remains the key psychological barrier deterring conservative corporate adoption.

What is the cost of running a node?  Is it a significant impact on electricity bill like mining?  

Also, I assume the device I'm running the node on has to stay on all the time or it will have to play ""Catch-up"" when turned back on?

Is there a difference between running a node and a full node?

Does compute power matter?  I have an M4 Mac book pro which should be more than enough but I travel with than and it wouldn't be on all the time.  i have an old spare laptop that I'd like to use but the compute is nowhere near as much.

Not because there’s hidden truth in it, but because it shows most people still don’t get what this is about.

Bitcoin isn’t a fad or a get-rich-quick scheme.  
It’s a **response** —to inflation, to endless money printing, to central banks injecting liquidity like there’s no tomorrow.  
It’s the **thermometer of global monetary fever**.

📉 In recent years, it’s estimated that **around 80% of all U.S. dollars in circulation were created after 2020**.  
It’s not an exact figure —depends on how you measure it— but it captures the scale of what happened.  
Never in modern history has so much money been created in such a short time.

And when money loses value due to oversupply, investors naturally look for something that **cannot be printed**.  
That’s where **Bitcoin** comes in.

It’s not magic or pure speculation; it’s a **logical reaction** to a system that only knows how to print its way out of every problem.  
As long as the world keeps financing deficits and political campaigns with new debt, **Bitcoin will keep rising** —  
not because of faith, but because of **math**.

There will only ever be **21 million**. Nothing more.

That’s why I don’t see it as a gamble, but as **insurance against monetary stupidity**.

📊 This chart says it all: **money printing has become the system’s main engine**.  
And in that context, **Bitcoin isn’t a bubble — it’s a consequence**.",,False,,False

I mean the exact moment 1 BTC trades for the median American home price (currently around ~$430k–$500k depending on the index).

Bitcoin isn’t being compared to real estate… it has become real estate.

Talent, capital, regulation, and geopolitical power tilt instantly and irreversibly.

Liquidity rotation begins: not “crypto bros buying houses,” but houses being sold for Bitcoin.

So I researched. Learned all about bitcoin. Looked at the charts. Watched Jack Mallers give an speech about a different type of money.

You set up a regular recurring buy (e.g., $30 every day).

The last days I took a deeper dive into the topic of asset-backed loans and wanted to see what can be achieved with them in terms of maxing out your Bitcoin holdings. I have build a scenario based on Bitcoins daily close data.

  
I am aware that these kind of loans with Bitcoin as collateral did not exist back then and nobody was aware of any kind of cycles, but let us just assume the following as a thought experiment:

Start date: 15.11.2010

Initial Investment: $1,000

LTV (loan to value): 25%

Interest: 9 %, fully capitalized into the loan

Loan run time: 4 years

  
1) On the start date, Bitcoin was valued at $0.27. I was able to acquire 3,703.7 BTC with Cash and further 925.93 BTC with the loan (4,629.63 BTC in total).

2) Four years later, the Bitcoin are worth $1.8 million in total. I can adjust the loan by $454k and buy 1,157.13 BTC with that (5,786.76 in total)

3) Further four years later, portfolio stands at $32 million. Loan of $7.3 million adds 1,334.2 BTC (7,120.97 BTC in total)

4) Last event yet in 2022, my portfolio would stand at $120 million. Loan of $19.9 adds 1,180.84 BTC (8,301.81 BTC in total)

5) Today these 8,301.81 BTC would be worth about $914 million

If I had just bought and held, I would be worth $407.8 million.

The loans helped me to buy 4,598.11 BTC, so about 1,5x my initial investment. Today total loan owed including interest would stand at $25.3 million.

This would mean a net worth of $889 million or a bit more than double of just buying and holding.

Now I know this is a very risky endeavour (Total owed/Total value was close to 45% at one point), but still shows what is possible. There probably may be even better points in time to buy if you happen to catch the bear market bottoms, but I tried to have evenly spread good entries every 4 years.",,False,,False

I am planning to invest in Bitcoin, because I have been reading about Bitcoin being used in some way to offset debt by the central banks in the future and also how Bitcoin can withstand time(inflation) and space(liquid and transaction-able globally).

My concern is:

1. Is this a good time to purchase? If I buy now, am I buying it expensive ?
2. How much percentage of my current cash should be put into bitcoin? Or should I do this systematically as spaced investments?

The only way to preserve your coins in a wrench atack is to be unable to access them.,Lanky-Occasion8005,2025-10-24T05:37:15,0,0.44,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1oeon57/decoy_wallets_arent_useful_the_only_way_to/,https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1oeon57/decoy_wallets_arent_useful_the_only_way_to/,"Every tutorial recommend setting a passphrase and letting some funds in the no-passphrase wallet as a decoy. You could even leave some funds in a passphrase wallet and have the majority of your stash in another passphrase.

By now any thief would know that. He would ask you to keep opening decoy wallets until you open a ver big one. How big, it depends on the thief. You may even open your true wallet and the thief could keep asking you to open the true wallet, expecting more coins.

Depending on how have you managed your privacy and transaction history he may even know exactly how much do you have.

So, I think the only realistic way to protect your coins is to be totally unable to comply with the thief. I can think several ways to archive that:

- Not having your hardware wallet, neither your seed words at home. If you only hodl, this is not a problem. If you want to spend, you could have some funds in a smaller wallet at home.

- A 2 of 3 Multisig, having the other 2 keys in separate location at several hours of travel

- Coldcard HW have the possibility to set an alternative PIN which wipes or bricks the device. This is nice, but the thief could know that and threaten you to not use it. I don't know if other brands have something similar.

- Coldcard also have the possibility to set some conditions of volume and velocity of your spendings. I think they do it through a Multisig. This is perhaps the simplest solution.

Those are not perfect solutions. The thief could get mad, threaten you or even harming you, but relaying in a decoy wallet is a much worse strategy in my opinion. If the thief is rational, if he sees that your are truly unable to access your coins, he should leave you.",,True,,False

That narrative ignores the deep structural data. BTC is following gold's path, but its superior liquidity makes it the first asset sold in a panic, confirming its efficiency, not failure.

The core conviction is that verified, non-speculative scarcity demand now dictates market structure. Knowledge is the real flex here.

1) Fundamental Correlation Lock: BTC's correlation with Gold stands above 0.85, a dramatic increase from the -0.8 observed in 2021. This high correlation confirms the long-term institutional valuation thesis of BTC as a primary store of value.

2) Institutional Supply Shock: BlackRock's IBIT contributed $477M in net ETF inflows, confirming routine, systematic allocation from large asset managers. This ""sticky"" capital provides a deep structural floor for Bitcoin.

3) Liquidity Paradox: The temporary price action where ""BTC down first, gold lags"" is simply due to BTC being the most liquid digital risk asset, confirming its efficiency. The long-term alignment overrides this temporary behavioral divergence.

The conflict is simple: Is the structural correlation the only truth for long-term allocation, or should investors hedge against the short-term liquidity anomaly that still causes price divergence?",,True,,False

Everyone keeps saying ""only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist"" like that's some tiny number. But then I learned each Bitcoin breaks down into 100 million satoshis.
So actually there's 2.1 QUADRILLION satoshis total. That's not exactly a small number.
And here's the thing - literally nobody I know who owns Bitcoin has a whole coin. Everyone's buying like $50 or $200 worth. We're all trading in these tiny fractions. The whole economy runs on satoshis, not whole bitcoins.
So why do we keep using the 21 million number to talk about scarcity? If the real tradeable units are in the quadrillions, how is that scarce?
Yeah yeah, I get it - cutting a pizza into more slices doesn't give you more pizza. The total VALUE doesn't change. But when you're trying to convince people Bitcoin is rare and limited, you're using the 21 million figure while conveniently ignoring that there are quadrillions of actual units people can buy and trade.
It's like measuring the US dollar supply in pennies and then being shocked there are trillions of them.
The divisibility is actually genius - don't get me wrong. But calling it ""scarce"" based on 21 million when there are 2.1 quadrillion tradeable units feels like we're moving the goalposts.

That doesn’t cause the move but those windows come with policy headlines and shifting expectations, which markets react to.

Timeline:

Late 2013 to early 2014 (Bernanke step down Yellen start)

* BTC cycle top: Dec 2013 ($1.2k).
* Chair change: Jan 31, 2014 Bernanke ends, Feb 3, 2014 Yellen starts (2 months after the BTC cycle top).
* What followed: a sharp monthly drop of 32% arrived in March 2014 (1 month after).

Late 2017 to early 2018 (Yellen step down Powell start)

* BTC cycle top: Dec 2017 ($19.7k).
* Chair change: Feb 3 to 5, 2018 Yellen ends, Powell starts (2 months after the BTC cycle top).
* What followed: another steep monthly selloff 33% in March 2018(1 month after).

Late 2021 to mid 2022 (Powell term renewal)

* BTC late cycle high: Nov 2021 (\~$69k).
* Chair milestone: first term ended on Feb 5th 2022 (2.5 months); second term was delayed and confirmed on May 2022 (during the shift to rate hikes/QT).
* What followed: the bear market accelerated into a 37% red candle June 2022( again 1 month after).

Why the Fed Chair Matters for Bitcoin:

The U.S. dollar dominates global finance, used in 88% of transactions and 59% of reserves, making the Fed’s monetary policy a key driver of Bitcoin’s price. The Fed controls liquidity via interest rates and QE/QT. Loose policy boosts risk assets like Bitcoin, tight policy suppresses them. Inflation fears also fuel Bitcoin’s “digital gold” appeal. The Fed Chair leads the FOMC, setting policy tone and expectations. A new Chair in 2026 could signal policy shifts, impacting Bitcoin’s volatility. While Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, its trading environment is fiat driven, tying its cycles to Fed actions.

Future Outlook:

Powell’s second term ends May 23, 2026. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could peak around Feb or March 2026 (2+ months prior), potentially followed by a bear market in June 2026, marked by a 30\~40% correction. However, external factors like regulation or global events could shift timelines.

Several signals point the same way:

\- On this Danish podcast, Payam says the “mark-to-market” idea is dead and the new proposal would tax real, realized gains similar to shares: [https://podcasts.apple.com/dk/podcast/novo-krypto-og-stenos-positioner/id1611141604?i=1000733069480&l=da](https://podcasts.apple.com/dk/podcast/novo-krypto-og-stenos-positioner/id1611141604?i=1000733069480&l=da)

\- Ammar (MP and tax spokesperson, Moderaterne) laid out a simple model in Børsen (Sep 10, 2025): tax only on conversion to DKK, treat gains as capital income, allow loss carryforward, and stop taxing crypto-to-crypto swaps.

Why this matters

\- Until now, Denmark effectively taxed every swap (even BTC→ETH) under personal income rates up to \~56%, used FIFO, and limited loss offsets. Result: huge admin burden and situations where you could owe tax despite breaking even after volatility.

\- The proposed model would look much closer to how stocks are taxed:

  \- Tax only when you convert crypto to Danish kroner (DKK).

  \- Crypto-to-crypto trades are not taxable events.

  \- Gains taxed as capital income (the Danish 27%/42% brackets), not personal income.

  \- Losses can be carried forward and offset against future crypto gains.

  \- “One trade, one result”: tax the actual profit (sale minus purchase), not hundreds of line items.

A few datapoints (Skattestyrelsen):

\- \~10% of Danish adults held crypto last year (\~290,000 people).

\- 65% hold under DKK 10,000.

\- 86% use crypto as an investment; only 18% as a payment method.

Timeline and caveats

\- This is a policy shift in motion, not law until Parliament passes it. The Reddit DK thread suggests 2026 as the earliest start.

\- Details will matter (transitional rules, documentation, exact loss carryforward mechanics, and whether DeFi/NFTs are included the same way).

\- Not tax advice—Danes should watch for the actual bill and guidance from Skattestyrelsen.

https://preview.redd.it/wdw6s1uhavwf1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2611da90dc4accf26d9b4ffed556fdf2978c3d6

Money used to have weight. That’s right, it was metallic, cold, and heavy, stamped by kings and trusted merchants who placed more trust in the crown’s face than in the man beside him. Later, it also became paper, promises printed by governments and traded for goods, for labor, and in exchange for time.

**Then it comes with screens.**

It turns out that money becomes numbers. Invisible but one finds it everywhere. We would not touch our wealth simply sees it appear and vanish at glowing rectangles. It usually felt comforting, but something was lost deeply in translation-the sense of having ownership with what was actually ours.

Then the phrase “ownership” becomes just a polite illusion, banks keep your money; governments watch your transactions, and corporations define your digital identity. There is access but no authority. There’s permission but no power.

Then, very quietly, in 2009, a pseudonym signed a manifesto. The prophet was Satoshi Nakamoto, the prophet who released a few pages of code and a radical idea: a financial system that needs no kings, no banks, no middlemen. A world where truth would be verified not by institutions but by consensus. Bitcoin was then born not as a product but as a rebellion, a protest against the architecture of control.

**But mostly, they did not notice it.**

The charts, the speculative frenzy: they were hubbed about price on the greener pastures, treating Bitcoin as a stock or at least as a shortcut to get rich. But to those gawking scholars, Bitcoin revealed something altogether deeper-it was a philosophical machine disguised as money.

It is not that bitcoin is made for making you rich; it is made for making you sovereign.

To possess your wealth is to possess your will. To move it freely is to move your voice. To verify it yourself is to own your truth. Bitcoin didn’t just reinvent currency; it redefined what it means to be an individual in a digital world.

However, in traditional economies, trust flows up. We trust banks to keep our savings safe, central authorities to ensure the fragility remaining intact, and governments and their codes to protect our rights. History is not short of recurring lessons reminding us about painful lessons that power once concentrated doesn’t remember whom it serves.

**And that flow is reversed by Bitcoin.**

It converts trust into verification, authority into protocol, and hierarchy into visibility. The blockchain doesn’t press for faith-it gives proof, each block a testament, each transaction a declaration that the truth can exist without permission.

**This is the silent revolution many still miss out on.**

Bitcoin is not just a monument or technological breakthrough but also one philosophical breakthrough. It embodies that very simple but dangerous thought: define how your freedom will be determined, not by the institution but by the individual.

Holding your private keys is like holding a digital equivalent of Locke’s natural rights-liberty encoded, property encrypted, consent expressed as a cryptographic signature. Political philosophy becomes software in the form of Bitcoin.

Thus, it’s like calling something money as too small to be narrowed down that way.

It is not the next version of finance; it is the first version of digital selving. It registers a huge change in human organization; as much as the invention of written law or the printing press, tools that not only change what humans do but what they are.

As we enter deeper into an era of surveillance capitalism, progammable currencies, and money, Bitcoin makes more and more sense; it is a mirror that reflects the tension between convenience and freedom, between the comfort of control and the courage of autonomy.

What Bitcoin is doesn’t basically make it flawless. What is required is onus. What it punishes is forgetfulness. What it doesn’t provide is refunds and what isn’t acceptable is excuses. All that is precisely the philosophy: freedom with accountability, sovereignty with consequence.

We are accustomed to systems that save us from our errors, but these also lock and limit themselves from our independence. Bitcoin invites us to grow up: to become stewards of our own digital lives.

ethereum,1of9qyf,I built an AI that actually knows Ethereum's entire codebase (and won't hallucinate),graphicaldot,2025-10-24T22:18:25,126,0.74,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1of9qyf/i_built_an_ai_that_actually_knows_ethereums/,https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1of9qyf/i_built_an_ai_that_actually_knows_ethereums/,"I spent a year at Polygon dealing with the same frustrating problem: new engineers took 3+ months to become productive because critical knowledge was scattered everywhere. A bug fix from 2 years ago lived in a random Slack thread. Architectural decisions existed only in someone's head. We were bleeding time.

So I built ByteBell to fix this for good.

# What it does:

ByteBell implements a state-of-the-art knowledge orchestration architecture that ingests every Ethereum repository, EIP, research papers, technical blog post, and documentation. Our system transforms these into a comprehensive knowledge graph with bidirectional semantic relationships between implementations, specifications, and discussions. When you ask a question, ByteBell delivers precise answers with exact file paths, line numbers, commit hashes, and EIP references—all validated through a sophisticated verification pipeline that ensures <2% hallucinations.

# Under the hood:

Unlike conventional ChatGPT wrappers, ByteBell employs a proprietary multi-agent architecture inspired by recent advances in Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG). Our system features:

1. **Dynamic Knowledge Subgraph Generation**: When you ask a question, specialized indexer agents identify relevant knowledge nodes across the entire Ethereum ecosystem, constructing a query-specific semantic network rather than simple keyword matching.
2. **Multi-stage Verification Pipeline**: Dedicated verification agents cross-validate every statement against multiple authoritative sources, confirming that each response element appears in multiple locations for triangulation before being accepted.
3. **Context Graph Pruning**: We've developed custom algorithms that recognize and eliminate contextually irrelevant information to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio, preventing the knowledge dilution problems plaguing traditional RAG systems.
4. **Temporal Code Understanding**: ByteBell tracks changes across all Ethereum implementations through time, understanding how functions have evolved across hard forks and protocol upgrades—differentiating between legacy, current, and testnet implementations.

# Example:

Ask ""How does EIP-4844 blob verification work?"" and you get the exact implementation in all execution clients, links to the specification, core dev discussions that influenced design decisions, and code examples from projects using blobs—all with precise line-by-line citations and references.

# Try it yourself:

[ethereum.bytebell.ai](http://ethereum.bytebell.ai)

I deployed it for free for the Ethereum ecosystem because honestly, we all waste too much time hunting through GitHub repos and outdated Stack Overflow threads. The ZK ecosystem already has one at [zcash.bytebell.ai](http://zcash.bytebell.ai), where developers report saving 5+ hours per week.

# Technical differentiation:

This isn't a simple AI chatbot—it's a specialized architecture designed specifically for technical knowledge domains. Every answer is backed by real sources with commit-level precision. ByteBell understands version differences, tracks changes across hard forks, and knows which EIPs are active on mainnet versus testnets.

# Works everywhere:

Web interface, Chrome extension, website widget, and integrates directly into Cursor and Claude Desktop \[MCP\] for seamless development workflows.

# The cutting edge:

The other ecosystems are moving fast on developer experience. Polkadot just funded this through a Web3 Foundation grant. Base and Optimism teams are exploring implementation. Ethereum should have the best developer tooling, Please reach out to use if you are in Ethrem foundation. DMs are open or reach to on twitter [https://x.com/deus\_machinea](https://x.com/deus_machinea)

# Anti-hallucination technology:

We've achieved <2% hallucination rates (compared to 45%+ in general LLMs) through our multi-agent verification architecture. Each response must pass through multiple parallel validation pipelines:

1. **Source Retrieval**: Specialized agents extract relevant code snippets and documentation
2. **Metadata Extraction**: Dedicated agents analyze metadata for versioning and compatibility
3. **Context Window Management**: Agents continuously prune retrieved information to prevent context rot
4. **Source Verification**: Validation agents confirm that each cited source actually exists and contains the referenced information
5. **Consistency Check**: Cross-referencing agents ensure all sources align before generating a response

This approach costs significantly more than standard LLM implementations, but delivers unmatched accuracy in technical domains. While big companies focus on growth and ""good enough"" results, we've optimized for precision first, building a system developers can actually trust for mission-critical work.

Anyway, go try it. Break it if you can. Tell me what's missing. This is for the community, so feedback actually matters. [ethereum.bytebell.ai](http://ethereum.bytebell.ai)

Please try it. The models have actually become really good at following prompts as compared to one year back when we were working on Local AI [https://github.com/ByteBell](https://github.com/ByteBell). We made all that code open sourced and written in Rust as well as Python but had to abandon it because access to Apple M machines with more than 16 GB of RAM was rare and smaller models under 32B are not so good at generating answers and their quantized versions are even less accurate.

Everybody is writing code using Cursor, Windsurf, and OpenAI. You can't stop them. Humans are bound to use the shortest possible path to money; it's human nature.  
Imagine these developers now have to understand how blockchain works, how cryptography works, how Solidity works, how EVM works, how transactions work, how gas prices work, how zk works, read about 500+ blogs and 80+ blogs by Vitalik, how Rust or Go works to edit code of EVM, and how different standards work.  
We have just automated all this. We are adding the functionality to generate tutorials on the fly.

We are also working on generating the full detailed map of GitHub repositories. This will make a huge difference.

**If someonw has told you that ""Multi agents framework with Customised Prompts and SLMs/LLMs"" will not work, Please read these papers.**

**Early MAS research**: Multi-agent systems emerged as a distinct field of AI research in the 1980s and 1990s, with works like Gerhard Weiss's 1999 book, Multiagent Systems, A Modern Approach to Distributed Artificial Intelligence. This research established that complex problems could be solved by multiple, interacting agents.   
**The Condorcet Jury Theorem**: This classic theoretical result in social choice theory demonstrates that if each participant has a better-than-random chance of being correct, a majority vote among them will result in near-perfect accuracy as the number of participants grows. It provides a mathematical basis for why aggregating multiple agents' answers can improve the overall result.   
  
**An Age old method to get the best results, If you go to Kaggle majority of them use Ensemble method. Ensemble learning:** In machine learning, ensemble methods have long used the principle of aggregating the predictions of multiple models to achieve a more accurate final prediction. A 2025 Medium article by Hardik Rathod describes ""demonstration ensembling,"" where multiple few-shot prompts with different examples are used to aggregate responses.

**The Autogen paper:** The open-source framework AutoGen, developed by Microsoft, has been used in many papers and demonstrations of multi-agent collaboration. The paper AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation Framework (2023) is a core text describing the architecture. 

**Improving LLM Reasoning with Multi-Agent Tree-of-Thought and Thought Validation (2024)**: This paper proposes a multi-agent reasoning framework that integrates the Tree-of-Thought (ToT) strategy. It uses multiple ""Reasoner"" agents that explore different reasoning paths in parallel. A separate ""Thought Validator"" agent then validates these paths, and a consensus-based voting mechanism is used to determine the final answer, leading to increased reliability.   
  
**Anthropic's multi-agent research system:** In a 2025 engineering blog post, Anthropic detailed its internal multi-agent research system. The system uses a ""LeadResearcher"" agent to create specialized sub-agents for different aspects of a query, which then work in parallel to gather information.

I’m working on a Web3 tool that uses a **tiered subscription model** (monthly access, different feature sets per tier). The catch:

* Our audience are **privacy-first Web3 users**, so we **don’t want to collect emails** or any personal info.
* We also **can’t really use Stripe**, since that involves traditional KYC and fiat rails.
* Each user might **connect multiple wallets** under the same subscription tier.

I’m trying to figure out the cleanest way to implement this kind of setup.

Some early thoughts:

* Using **smart contracts** for subscription tiers (maybe via ERC-721 or ERC-1155 “membership NFTs”).
* Payment in **stablecoins** (USDC, DAI, etc.) or native gas tokens (ETH, MATIC, etc.).
* Maybe integrate something like **Superfluid** for streaming payments, or **Unlock Protocol** for token-gated access.
* Managing multiple wallets per user without a centralized identity layer is tricky — possibly link wallets via signed messages or ENS text records?

Has anyone tackled a **non-custodial, privacy-respecting subscription** model before?  
What tools or protocols would you recommend as “Web3-native Stripe alternatives”?

Would love to hear how others are approaching subscription logic, recurring payments, and wallet linking in decentralized contexts.",,True,,False
ethereum,1odcd4y,Gitcoin Grants 24 is testing zk-based voting (MACI + Privote) — and I’m in the Privacy Round!,haochizzle,2025-10-22T17:02:47,8,0.72,1,https://youtu.be/P29VM2FIvNY?si=PPaj4a85rac9RDyx,https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1odcd4y/gitcoin_grants_24_is_testing_zkbased_voting_maci/,"Hey everyone 👋🏾

I wanted to share something exciting — my youtube channel “90 Seconds to Crypto” was accepted into the Privacy Round of Gitcoin Grants 24!

For anyone unfamiliar, Gitcoin is a public goods funding protocol built on Ethereum. It’s where open-source builders, researchers, educators, and creators can receive community funding through mechanisms like quadratic funding — where 100 people donating $1 matters more than 1 person donating $100.

What makes this round special is that the Privacy Round is using MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) and Privote, a private, zk-proof-based voting system that ensures every vote is tamper-proof, private, and verifiable — making this round a real experiment in testing zk-based voting that could one day power even bigger digital democracies. 

My channel focuses on values-driven, principles-led crypto education — shining light on projects building real-world utility and privacy tech (think Railgun, Fileverse, Fluidkey, etc).

If that resonates, you can support my work through Gitcoin here: [https://gitcoin.privote.live/rounds/0/0xcf7e8154450b0b6c477d9984ec3dec12bc4ea602c0913accc08e26a9a705bce1](https://gitcoin.privote.live/rounds/0/0xcf7e8154450b0b6c477d9984ec3dec12bc4ea602c0913accc08e26a9a705bce1)

Every donation, even $1, helps massively thanks to quadratic funding — and all proceeds go directly to keeping the channel going and spreading the good word on good work in crypto.

I also made a video breaking all this down — from Gitcoin’s funding model to how MACI works:

🎥 [https://youtu.be/P29VM2FIvNY?si=kj5A4gyidQSwPNCM](https://youtu.be/P29VM2FIvNY?si=kj5A4gyidQSwPNCM)

According to their announcement, the Stobox 4 tokenization platform’s **STV3 Protocol Architecture** is built on Diamonds, giving it modular and upgradeable smart contracts. This allows the security token’s logic (compliance rules, jurisdictional requirements, governance modules, etc.) to evolve without redeploying the token contract.

Why this matters:

* **Regulatory flexibility** – facets can be upgraded to meet changing legal requirements.
* **Stability** – the token address stays the same, aiding audits and investor trust.
* **Reusability** – the platform can support multiple offerings using shared contract modules.

This is one of the first public examples of **Diamonds used in a regulated STO**, showcasing how EIP-2535 can support real-world asset tokenization and long-term contract maintenance.

ethereum,1ocfok4,Question on how Bhutan national ID on Ethereum works,johanngr,2025-10-21T16:15:31,9,1.0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ocfok4/question_on_how_bhutan_national_id_on_ethereum/,https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ocfok4/question_on_how_bhutan_national_id_on_ethereum/,"When the user signs something with their national ID, does the party they verify against receive the full ID signed by the government (such that it can be leaked), and does these credentials (that conform to ""W3C standard"" right) include a ""decentralized identifier"", and on Ethereum there is a lookup table somewhere with Bhutan ""decentralized identifiers"" to public keys, such that the party being verified against can verify that the person was the owner of the credentials?

In other words, can the credentials trivially be leaked, as there is no ""trapdoor"" or such (as this requires the government key being the one that authenticates, and if user authenticates that part has to be sacrificed but the benefit is the government is no longer notified each time ID is used)?

**Edit:** According to Claude AI it seems BBS+ is what solves this problem, and lets the signed credentials still be proven only relative the party verified against, such that they cannot leak the credentials. **Edit:** It now seems the Bhutan ID does not have that property, and that it would require ""designated verifier signatures"". Anyone who is an expert on how Bhutan national ID works or the standard it is based on (W3C?) feel free to explain.

**Update:** It seems the Bhutan national ID is not private as proofs can be leaked (and in cybersecurity they should be considered public, anything that can leak will leak). Whereas designated verified signatures, an older and probably simpler system, seems to provide true privacy. I assumed ""state of the art"" national ID on Ethereum would do so, but seems it does not. I am *not an expert* on these things, and I am trying to understand best I can as I am interested in seeing advances in digital ID.

Back in 2016, Alex Van de Sande (Avsa) launched a joke token called Unicorn Meat, poking fun at Ethereum’s unicorn mascot by tokenizing “grinded unicorns.” It started as an April Fool’s experiment, but like many things in early Ethereum, it accidentally became something more, one of the first DAO-style experiments and possibly the first trustless token swap ever.

Members of the “Unicorn Meat Association” could make proposals, vote, and even seize control of the contract. That’s exactly what happened when Piper Merriam, another core Ethereum dev, staged an on-chain coup and took ownership from Avsa. Vitalik even interacted with the reddit posg himself. It was playful, chaotic, and years ahead of its time... a few months later, the real DAO hack would happen, but Unicorn Meat had already lived the prototype version of that story.

Now, almost a decade later, the contract has been revived in the same spirit, through another coup. Unicorn Meat is back and tradable again. It’s the only memecoin ever created by Ethereum Foundation devs, and a genuine piece of on-chain history.

[Trailer for Code is Law](https://reddit.com/link/1o8a3i9/video/jfhgvq04xhvf1/player)

Hey everyone - I’m James, a UK-based investigative journalist and first-time indie filmmaker. I’ve spent the past two years alongside my fellow director Louis Giles making *Code is Law*, a feature-length documentary about some of the most infamous exploits in Ethereum’s history.

The film explores a wave of massive smart contract hacks where attackers stole millions — and then claimed it was all perfectly legal. Starting with **The DAO**, it traces a lineage of exploits including **Indexed Finance**, **KyberSwap**, and **Mango Markets**, where the phrase “*code is law*” went from meme to courtroom defence. 

We speak to the developers, investigators, and white hats who lived through these events - including the hunt for **Andean Medjedovic**, a teenage math prodigy who stole **$65 million** and became the first hacker to claim “code is law”. Medjedovic is now a **fugitive from FBI charges** who has been on the run for almost five years. 

The film also covers the case of Avraham Eisenberg, whose $110 million Mango Markets exploit became the first courtroom test of the 'code is law' defence - and set a legal precedent with global implications.

This is a topic that is not given much focus by leaders in ""blockchain"", although Gavin Wood has increasingly talked about it in the last couple of years and made it a priority to migrate Polkadot to ""one person, one unit of stake"", what I call ""proof-of-suffrage"". To me, it is inevitable, and a logical next step, that every country in the world starts to run such a system. For traditional national IDs to be secure on-chain, the newer generation ""digital ID"" is needed where the personal data is held by the individual and proofs are generated with ""trapdoors"" and such (so they cannot be leaked) and possibly things like ""zero knowledge proofs"" to prove ""is over 18"" (I do not understand how those works but it seems like it could apply there). Such are starting to make their way into national ID systems and Bhutan is (I assume) using that technology. This all seems like something that people all over the world could unite around, both people in a presumed ""crypto community"" and then also all other people who are part of the ""nation state community"" or ""international community"". A very good thing is that once a very good standard for ""proof-of-suffrage blockchain"" has been produced, every country can use that (incl. Bhutan...) but it can also be used with alternative national ID systems such as video pseudonym parties from 2015/2018.",,True,,False

I've been in the crypto marketing space for a while and keep seeing projects get absolutely wrecked by fake KOLs.

**What I've noticed:**

\- Most ""top crypto KOLs"" have 60-90% bot followers

\- Agencies ghost after taking payment

\- Zero transparency on actual results

\- Projects burning $10K-50K for basically nothing

**Genuinely curious:**

1. Have you hired KOLs for your project? How did it go?

2. What was the biggest red flag you missed?

3. How do you currently vet influencers?

4. What would make you actually trust a KOL marketplace?

**Why I'm asking:**

Been working on this problem for months. Built something (KOLsHub) that manually vets every influencer and shows real-time analytics. Testing it with real campaigns.

But before going further, I want to hear from people who've actually dealt with this mess.

I’m Brian (bsmokes), Founder of Pistachio. We’ve just gone live with an integration that I think meaningfully improves the onboarding experience for Ethereum users.

We integrated Coinbase Ramp directly into Pistachio to make getting funds onto Base simple and fast.

Here’s what it looks like today:

* Instant deposits of USDC and ETH directly to Base (up to $500/week)
* Apple Pay support (debit cards only for now)
* No ID checks required for US residents (including NY!)
* No fees for the first $50,000 deposited  
* All settling natively on Base without extra hops or bridge delays  

Why this matters:

* Coinbase Ramp provides a secure and compliant fiat-to-crypto flow, but funds arrive in a **self-custody smart wallet**, not a custodial account  
* Deposits go straight to Base, avoiding mainnet friction and unnecessary costs for new users
* Waiving early fees allows people to test the flow without losing value on the way in  

Onboarding remains one of the hardest problems in crypto. Our goal is to remove barriers for new users while keeping the experience fully onchain and user-owned.

The integration is live today. I would love feedback from this community, whether it’s testing the flow or critiquing the approach (L2, L2, I know). We are building for scale, but also want to make sure we get it right for early adopters.

This solution brings with it the risk of a penalty (note, only on *one* of the phases) that may end up imposed on an innocent intermediary. The original solution to this in 2006 was to make the penalty gradual, a microscopic amount per second, but the problem is that the cumulative time until the payment times out then tends to get so long that the timeout itself no longer serves to solve the ""reserve payment attack"", and while the penalty could be a sufficient solution *there was only a penalty on one of the phases*. So, people settled for ""staggered timeouts"" as a work around, but this does not fix the problem, network failures or denial of service attacks can still cause an innocent intermediary to end up paying for the full payment.

The solution is to add the penalty on both phases. This is easily done once you realize that the *other* 2-phase commit, that finishes on timeout, also only has a penalty on one of the phases but it has it on the *opposite* phase. Thus, you can simply **combine** them and add a phase in between that shifts the action of the timeout, thus you get a 3-phase commit.

https://preview.redd.it/acpqejl9r3tf1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4714eaa27a4ad245d2ab352a11b3bc69fa9b339

I built Ryan Fugger's base layer already (just 2500 lines of code with zero dependencies) and adding ""collateral"" (""state proof"" on top of the ""base payment channel"") is very easy. Raiden could be built and finished with minimal work. If anyone is interested. My goal is already achieved with the base layer (as my vision only required it to exits) but I could help out with pointers if anyone wants to get a real Raiden created.

I have more material, video presentation, complete implementation, etc, if anyone is interested. And I can walk anyone through it as well in chat for example here in discussion thread, the 3-phase commit is **very simple** it was just a bit hard to discover as people tend to follow the path already made by others (the cancel-on-timeout 2-phase commit, whereas I approached the other one and naturally noticed both together would *transcend* the limitations of either).

I’m trying to set up a Helius webhook to detect **every new liquidity pool creation** on the Solana network (Raydium, Orca, [Pump.fun](http://Pump.fun), etc.).

I’m using the `/v0/webhooks` endpoint with `transactionTypes: [""CREATE_POOL""]`. I’ve tried including `accountAddresses` and even `programAddresses`, but it only triggers when those specific token accounts are involved.

What I really need is a way to listen for **all** `CREATE_POOL` events across the network — basically, whenever a new pool is created, no matter which program triggers it.

Is it possible to leave `accountAddresses` empty or omit it entirely so the webhook captures everything? Or is there another approach to monitor all pool creation events efficiently?

Any insight or working example would be super appreciated.",Dev/Tech,True,,False

Institutional demand for the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF was immediate and overwhelming, securing $220 million in AUM before trading even began. This is a massive structural endorsement.

The core conviction is that compliant, yield-bearing products are the key to separating SOL's trajectory from retail speculation. 

1. Yield Legitimacy: BSOL secured landmark SEC approval by integrating a 7% average annual staking yield. This implicit regulatory legitimization of staking is the critical feature, allowing institutions to capture on-chain rewards within a regulated wrapper.

2. Liquidity Shock: BSOL's debut volume of $55.4 million surpassed over 850 other ETFs launched in 2025. The 0% fee waiver for the first $1B in assets is an aggressive move to acquire foundational market share.

3. The Drag Risk: The biggest threat to this institutional conviction is still macro. Analysts warn the 7% yield may not be enough to offset the loss in Net Asset Value if a BTC correction drags the high-beta altcoin down disproportionately faster.

The market has unlocked compliant yield. Is the structured 7% staking yield enough to stabilize Solana against a severe BTC price drag, or is the underlying high-beta risk still the dominant force in the short term?",Ecosystem,True,,False

I am currently working on a small project in python, which trades solana memecoins (pump fun, bonk, raydium etc.)
Now, I want the program to decide whether or not to exit the trade, for which I logically need to find the unrealized PNL in order to make some decisions based on it.

The problem is I have not found any solutions for this so far.
I did find some ways to obtain price data to then calculate the unrealized pnl, but these are GET requests, which are rate limited.
While for a single position, checking the price and calculating the current unrealized pnl about 2 times per second could work, I need to have the pnl as up to date as possible for up to 15 positions simultaneously. This would mean I would have to send up to 30 requests per second, which will very likely get rate limited. I would need some kind of websocket or something for it to work.

Unfortunately as I'm still a trencher, I can't afford some ""super duper private premium RPC"" for 500 bucks a month..
I see many wallets using automated trading, therefore it cant be THAT complicated, right? I mean, PNL is basically the most important factor in trades.

Volume was solid, flows look promising, and GSOL’s conversion tomorrow adds heft. Yet the noise level is… muted. No meme tsunami, fewer victory laps, more “cool, noted” from the timeline.

That’s not necessarily bad. In 2021, retail FOMO plus social hype were jet fuel… and whipsaw risk. Today’s setup is more methodical. Institutions can now get SOL through a ’33 Act wrapper on the NYSE… Bitwise priced it at 0.20% with a temporary fee waiver and even included staking… the fee war is very real. It’s efficient, but also kind of sterile. The adoption many of us wanted… just delivered in a suit and tie.

Context matters too. Attention is fragmented. FinTwit is busy with AI mega-caps and macro. And psychology plays a role: a new SOL ETF is big for the ecosystem, but it doesn’t hit like “the first ever spot BTC ETF.” Once the category exists, follow…ons feel incremental… even if they move real capital over quarters.

The bull case is straightforward: if BTC and ETH are the “core,” SOL can become the “growth” leg for multi…asset mandates. If flows compound… if tracking stays tight… if distribution widens beyond day…one curiosity… $3B over 12…18 months isn’t crazy. The bear (or at least sober) case: early volume ≠ durable demand, and crypto ETP flows can be lumpy. Without persistent creations, spreads widen and enthusiasm fades.

Small note on the rest of the day’s launches… Canary’s Hedera and Litecoin ETFs listed on Nasdaq and are much smaller, so flows will probably be lighter than SOL.  
One interesting angle here… as more traditional investors gain exposure through ETFs, the tax side of crypto investing is about to get more layered. Swaps, staking rewards, conversions, and even ETF-based gains all feed into taxable events in different ways. It’s a good reminder that if you’re already balancing on-chain trades with new ETF exposure, tools like Awaken tax make life a lot easier by syncing wallets and exchange data automatically so you don’t end up sorting hundreds of transactions at year end.

My read: this is a legitimacy step, not a confetti cannon. The question isn’t “did it pop today?” It’s “does it keep showing up on statements for the next six earnings calls?” Anyone else feeling that shift… from hype cycles to slow, boring normalization?",Ecosystem,True,,False

When will they be available to trade in the U.S.? Nobody knows for sure. Hopefully, this will cause SOL to go way up and at least double in the next several months, from 200 to 400+. Personally, I recently got the 2X SOL ETF called SOLT which is already available, and if SOL doubles to 400 or more (which is my belief), then this 2X SOL ETF should do EVEN BETTER and may go from 20 to about 80.

This is what came up on a google search:

It is possible that some spot Solana (SOL) ETFs could be available to trade in the U.S. tomorrow, October 28, 2025. Some exchanges appear to be moving forward with listings despite the ongoing government shutdown. However, the U.S. government shutdown has created uncertainty regarding the official launch date, as final Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval is delayed for many applicants. 

Key details

* **NYSE listings:** On Monday, October 27, 2025, the New York Stock Exchange posted listing notices for several spot crypto ETFs, including the Bitwise Solana Fund and the Grayscale Solana Trust.
* **Bitwise Solana Staking ETF:** This fund received certification from NYSE Arca on Monday, October 27, with trading potentially beginning as soon as Tuesday, October 28.
* **Government shutdown:** The SEC has not been able to process all of the necessary S-1 filings due to the shutdown, which complicates the launch for most applicants.
* **21Shares ETF:** The 21Shares Solana ETF has already been registered on the Cboe BZX Exchange, having received provisional approval from the SEC. However, its final trading review was on hold due to the government shutdown.
* **Other applicants:** Firms like Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, CoinShares, and VanEck have also filed applications and are awaiting regulatory action. 

Important context

While some funds might start trading, the situation is complex due to the government shutdown impacting official SEC procedures. Investors should confirm the listing status of specific ETFs with their brokerage before attempting to trade.

What many thought to be the next leg up quickly turned into the largest Black Swan event in crypto history. In a matter of hours, a cascade of liquidations tore through decentralized markets on all chains. Over **$19 billion in collateral** was wiped out as asset prices plunged, gas fees spiked, and oracle wicks widened the pain. Borrowers saw vaults erased, lenders saw yields evaporate, and stability mechanisms were tested across every major lending protocol.



Billions were liquidated, but not all losses were equal. Individual protocols have different means of protection against crises such as this one. Depending on where you were trading, the same position would have ended up with a different outcome.  
  
I’ve gathered three of the most prominent DeFi protocols to see who combatted this price action most effectively, and how their users faired:



# 1. Drift

I wanted to start with Drift because they have a unique approach to activating liquidation thresholds. A total of $76 million was wiped out on Drift alone, but the platform incurred **zero** bad debt. This was primarily thanks to four main features :

# 1. Oracle Price, not Mark Price

Many speculate this is where Binance went wrong last week. Mark Price is a method of calculating the price of assets internally derived from oracle pricing, but factoring in other considerations.This can be a slippery slope and cause widespread depegging; precisely what users of Binance experienced. Drift stays away from this, and goes even further than solely using oracle price to prove extra layers of security to traders on their platform.  


# 2. 5 Minute TWAP 

Drift liquidates based on a 5 Minute Time-Weighted Average price. Out of the 4,608 users at risk on their platform, almost half (2,303) were saved by these guardrails. Liquidations are blocked based on a 50% divergence between the oracle price and the oracle’s 5 minute TWAP (thank you Chris Pheaney).



# 3. Partial Liquidations

All it takes is one unfavorable wick to entirely wipe out your position. At least, that’s how it usually goes. On Drift, liquidations are done on a slightly larger time frame, 10 seconds was given as an example, to give time for price stabilization. Another method of combatting god candles in the wrong direction.   


# 4. Drift’s Insurance Fund/AMM

When all else fails and bad debt starts to build, Drift has a robust USDC Insurance Fund to cover any losses. It’s sourced by both protocol revenue and external stakers. Those who deposited into the Insurance Fund made 600K from this event alone.



Not to mention, Drift currently has the highest OI - Volume Ratio post-dump, so it seems users are relatively satisfied with their performance this past weekend. All in all, no socialized losses were incurred across all of their perp users, and if they had been, they would be spread out pro-rata ( @cindyleowtt).  
  
No downtime, no user losses,  I am impressed to say the least. ([@tracybbd ](https://x.com/tracybbd)[https://x.com/tracybbd/status/1979027380355162615](https://x.com/tracybbd/status/1979027380355162615)[ )](https://x.com/tracybbd)



# 2. Kamino



8,103 liquidations spread across 1,671 wallets. Coincidentally, Kamino improved their liquidation engine barely over a month before all of this happened. Unlike other major DeFi protocols, Kamino doesn’t offer an insurance protocol, but still is able to boast an incredible $0 bad debt accrued. Here’s what’s helped them maintain that:

1. **Auto-deleveraging**

When an asset's supply or borrow amount is considered too risky, K-Lend’s auto-deleveraging mechanism kicks in automatically. Partial liquidations now occur in 10% increments preventing your entire position from being wiped out at once. Additionally, penalties for liquidation are as low as 0.1% as of early September. This is 10x better than they performed before.



[https://x.com/KaminoFinance/status/1962568881333019033/video/1](https://x.com/KaminoFinance/status/1962568881333019033/video/1) (video from Kamino as graphic showing partial unwinding) 

# 2. Dynamic Interest Rates

With a poly-linear interest rate curve, Kamino’s constantly changing interest rates keep things stable by encouraging:

* lenders to supply into the market
* borrowers to repay debt

By implementing this, users are encouraged to actively monitor their positions; thus, be aware of large liquidation events occurring.

# 3. Kamino’s Risk Council

During extreme events, Kamino’s core team works alongside DeFi industry leaders such as SteakhouseFi and Re7 Labs to safeguard the platform. They have the power to manually deleverage,, unwind positions, and more when deemed necessary. It’s an added layer of comfort to an already heavily audited and secure protocol.



Since launching in 2023, they have retained **zero** bad debt through $140M + in liquidations with no insurance fund needed. They continue to bring new innovations to how they perform liquidations when necessary, and have the second highest TVL out of protocols on Solana for a reason. If you’d like a more in-depth breakdown of Kamino during this timeframe, I thank AllezLabs put together a substantial summary and providing us with plenty of insightful data. ([https://x.com/AllezLabs/status/1977386055704997898](https://x.com/AllezLabs/status/1977386055704997898))

# 3. Hyperliquid

The behemoth of all perps platforms, Hyperliquid, was put to the test with this being their first Black Swan event since inception. Maintaining billions of perps volume on the daily over the last few months; they took the blunt of liquidations suffer

# HLP Vault

The Hyperliquid Liquidity Provider vault, or HLP for short, provides liquidity to the orderbooks and makes market-making possible on Hyperliquid. ( thanks CEO Jeff ). For the first time in over two years, the HLP failed, and Hyperliquids’ Cross-margin Auto-deleveraging system kicked in. For those who might be unfamiliar with this mechanism, it works like this:



1. User’s position/account falls below the required maintenance margin and is now undercollateralized (in this case, due to a sharp drop in prices form the oracle)
2. A liquidation is triggered and sent to the orderbooks to buy/sell at market price
3. Due to extreme volatility, the orderbooks are slammed and the position cant be fully exited
4. The HLP (Hyperliquidity-Provider) vault assumes ownership of the remaining collateral to exit the position once some time has passed and things have stabilized
5. If the HLP liquidation backstop is not enough, ADL begins to kick in.

# Cross Margin ADL

As you know now, a lot has to happen to get to this point. Once there, users are given a rank, and  those with the highest unrealized PNL and larger leverage are put on the chopping block first. They begin to have their positions automatically deleveraged to cover any outstanding bad debt. This is when people took to CT to let their complaints be heard, but the stats don't lie:  
  


* <20 mins for HLP to liquidate billions of $
* 100% uptime
* No bad debt



Hyperliquid operated exactly as intended, and showed us why it’s number one in the perps space across all chains.

# A Win For DeFi

Across the board, DeFi is stepping up. Loopscale maintained zero bad debt. Projec Zero protected 100% of user solvency across 2,000+ liquidations—only $1.8M liquidated thanks to partial liquidations that bring users back to health instead of wiping them out entirely. Orca held the line when other proprietary AMMs pulled liquidity and left users stranded.  
  
[https://x.com/0xGumshoe/status/1977781022184878252](https://x.com/0xGumshoe/status/1977781022184878252)

Had this happened three years ago—hell, even two—we would've seen protocol insolvencies, immense socialized losses, and cascading failures across the ecosystem. Instead, we saw transparent liquidation engines, robust insurance mechanisms, and oracle systems that held under pressure.

On October 11th, CEXs went down, their trust went with it, and DeFi didn't even flinch. This is the real-world proof of what DeFi offers and TradFi can't.

But this is just the beginning. The value prop is there—now imagine where it's going. Automation, agents, the possibilities are truly endless. 24/7 position monitoring, pre-liquidation rebalancing, cross-protocol optimization in milliseconds. If DeFi can survive this stress test with manual infrastructure, what happens when agentic workflows take over?

The foundation is set. Automation is coming. TradFi has no choice but to take notice.

solana,1ohexzh,The Reasoning Layer: Why Dashboards Make You Dumb on a 50k TPS Chain,Narrow_Chance7639,2025-10-27T14:50:28,2,0.58,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1ohexzh/the_reasoning_layer_why_dashboards_make_you_dumb/,https://reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1ohexzh/the_reasoning_layer_why_dashboards_make_you_dumb/,"The core problem with data on a high-throughput network like Solana is a simple paradox: the more dashboards you open, the worse your trades get. Everyone thinks the edge is in having more raw data, but after years of staring at charts, I realized 95% of on-chain activity is pure, irrelevant noise. This is especially true on a Web-scale blockchain built for 50k TPS.

The true alpha is hiding in the remaining 5% patterns so subtle that only reasoning, not reporting, can catch them.

The core conviction is that AI doesn't need more data; it needs better thoughts. We are teaching models to summarize markets, but not to reason through them. 

1) The Problem

Dashboards are dead. Every on-chain interface feels the same: cold, raw, and noisy. I got tired of being lied to by a flood of liquidity metrics and basic wallet alerts. The sheer volume of transactions that Solana enables at near-zero cost is now the problem itself: volume without verified intent is data noise.

2) The Solution (The Technical Brag)

I didn't build AI to predict price; I built it because I was tired of the information deficit. It took 1000+ hours, scanning across 10,000+ tokens (including the entire Solana dApp ecosystem), and way too much caffeine, but I’ve got a reasoning layer that now ignores that 95% noise in real time.

This layer surfaces narrative flows and strategic wallet shifts before they show up on charts.

It’s not another dashboard. It's the beginning of intelligence.

That's my side of the story all about fighting the data noise on a high-speed chain. What's the biggest data-related pain point you’ve personally faced in building or trading on Solana, and what structural weakness in the traditional dashboard market is the most critical to fix next?",Dev/Tech,True,,False

But the core barrier for large-scale adoption remains confidentiality. The true growth is now constrained by cryptography, not speed.

The core conviction is that FHE is the strategic imperative that turns Solana into a compliant venue for proprietary trading.

1) Throughput vs. Privacy Conflict: Solana recorded $326 Billion in Q3 DEX volume, confirming its capacity for high-velocity activity. However, traditional public blockchain transparency is unsuitable for proprietary financial operations.

2) The FHE Solution: Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows data to be processed on-chain while remaining encrypted. Zama's FHEVM is the protocol enabling this for confidential smart contracts.

3) The Scalability Roadmap: The historical barrier is breaking.
The FHE roadmap targets 10,000+ TPS per chain via specialized ASICs. This is the necessary capacity to confidently bring global payments and high-volume institutional activity confidentially on-chain.

# 🔁 SBPF Linker Opens New Languages

I wrote about the launch of the [SBPF Linker built by Blueshift](https://blog.colosseum.com/toolapalooza-sbpf-linker-gitfish-litesvm-docs/) last week, which has opened the door for developers to build Solana programs in entirely new ways.

In just the past week, developers have successfully compiled programs in Swift, C, Nim, Zig, and even Python, expanding beyond Rust as the primary language for Solana programs.

Early community experiments include:

* [**C-Nocchio**](https://github.com/BretasArthur1/C-Nocchio?ref=blog.colosseum.com): A minimal proof of concept showing Solana programs can be written in pure C with direct syscalls, zero-copy data handling, and a simple macro for the entrypoint.
* [**Clana**](https://github.com/Rhovian/clana?ref=blog.colosseum.com): A lightweight template that lets developers build Solana BPF programs in standard C, with no Solana SDK required, direct syscalls, LLVM-based builds, and Rust integration testing.
* [**Pylana**](https://github.com/BretasArthur1/pylana?ref=blog.colosseum.com): A hand-built transpiler that uses Python to generate Solana-compatible code through LLVM IR.
* [**Zignocchio**](https://github.com/vitorpy/zignocchio?ref=blog.colosseum.com): A POC showing how to build Solana programs in Zig, featuring the Zignocchio SDK, auto-generated syscall bindings, and a fully automated Zig build and testing pipeline.
* [**Swiftana**](https://github.com/dhl/swiftana?ref=blog.colosseum.com): Compiles Swift into Solana BPF programs, featuring custom LLVM passes, direct syscalls, and full Rust-based integration testing.
* [**Nimlana**](https://github.com/0xIchigo/nimlana?ref=blog.colosseum.com): Shows how to build Solana BPF programs in Nim, leveraging Nim’s C compilation to target Solana for educational and testing purposes.

While most are still proofs of concept, this marks a major step toward making Solana development accessible to a wider range of developers and communities.

# 🛡️ Range's Onchain Risk Verifier

Range has launched onchain account risk verification for Solana programs, powered by its Risk API and Switchboard’s On-Demand Oracles. 

Range’s onchain risk verifier brings real-time, signed risk data directly into Solana programs without forcing critical security and compliance checks to happen outside program logic.

Developers can now verify wallet and counterparty risk in real time using signed, tamper-proof data directly inside programs. 

The flow is simple: 

1. A client requests a signed “quote” from Range’s Risk API through a Switchboard OracleJob. 
2. Switchboard’s oracles execute the job, sign the result, and return it to the program
3. Program verifies the signature with QuoteVerifier before acting on it.

Because Switchboard’s oracles work on demand, developers avoid continuous data feeds and extra infrastructure while keeping verifiable security.

To get started, developers can follow the [Integrate Range's Onchain Risk Verifier into your Solana Program](https://www.range.org/blog/integrate-range-onchain-risk-verifier-into-your-solana-program?ref=blog.colosseum.com) guide to learn how to request risk quotes with the Switchboard SDK and verify them onchain.

# ⛏️ ORE Relaunch

ORE has relaunched its mining protocol on Solana with a complete redesign aimed at creating a Solana-native store of value. 

The new mining mechanism uses a 5x5 grid where miners claim space with SOL over one-minute rounds. The SOL from 24 losing blocks is distributed proportionally to claimants on the one winning block, which is selected by a secure random number generator. 

The protocol includes a Motherlode feature, a pool that accumulates ORE each round and is randomly awarded to winning miners.

A key change is the introduction of protocol revenue and value capture. 

10% of all SOL mining rewards are collected as revenue to automatically buy back ORE from the open market. This purchased ORE is then ""buried"" (removed from circulation but can be mined again), potentially leading to net deflation. 

The protocol has already driven over 990 SOL in buybacks over the past week.

Additionally, a 10% refining fee on claimed ORE rewards is redistributed to other miners based on their unclaimed rewards, incentivizing long-term holding. 

Staking is funded by 10% of the ORE bought back with protocol revenue, offering a non-dilutive yield for long-term holders. 

ORE’s revenue growth has been accelerating rapidly, crossing $130K in 24hr protocol revenue.

# 🔱 Trident VS Code Extension

Trident has launched the first VS Code extension designed specifically for Solana development, bringing real-time security analysis into the IDE. 

The extension provides two key features:

1. Automatic vulnerability detection
2. Visual feedback on test coverage

The static analysis feature includes a wide range of detectors that catch common Solana-specific security issues such as missing signer checks, unsafe lamports zeroing, and attempts to mutate immutable accounts. 

These checks run as developers type, allowing early identification of potential problems before code review or audit.

The integrated fuzz coverage visualization shows which parts of the code are tested to help developers find edge cases that unit tests may miss.

The extension is free, open source, and works with any Solana project.

# ⏫ SIMD-0266: p-token

SIMD-0266, proposes replacing the current SPL Token program with a CU version called p-token. 

Authored by developers at Anza, this update aims to cut token program CUs by up to 98%, unlocking more capacity for onchain activity and boosting Solana’s overall throughput.

Currently, token program instructions consume around 10% of each block’s compute budget. By reducing that figure to a fraction of its current level, p-token could free nearly 12% of block space, allowing more transactions to fit in each block.

The proposal introduces a complete reimplementation of the SPL Token program with zero-copy data access and no heap allocations, while remaining fully backward compatible so developers won’t need to modify existing code. 

If approved by validators, this change would be one of the most significant efficiency upgrades in Solana’s core infrastructure to date.

# 🚀 Meteora Launchpad Upgrades

Meteora has introduced three major upgrades to give projects more control over how tokens launch on Solana.

* **Presale Vaults:** Let teams raise funds with custom conditions, such as launching only after a funding goal is met, ensuring demand-driven and secure launches.
* **Meteora Invent:** Streamlines the launch process with a toolkit that automates complex setup steps, allowing teams to deploy tokens quickly without deep technical expertise.
* **Dynamic Fee Sharing**: Enables projects to design custom, non-custodial fee distribution models, deciding exactly how and to whom launch fees are shared.

These upgrades give projects more control and customization in how they distribute their token launches.

1) Selective Rotation Confirmed: While Bitcoin ETPs registered heavy outflows ($946 million), Solana funds saw inflows surge 67% to $156 million. This selective inflow underscores institutional preference for liquidity and proven ecosystems.

This article aims to establish a targeted developmental strategy – the ""SOL Focus Strategy"" – under the grand narrative of ICM, covering areas from tokenomic model optimization to secondary ecological development. The north star goal of this strategy is to enhance SOL's value capture capability, thereby incentivizing ecological growth and aligning with the grand narrative of ICM.



# 1. Tokenomic Model Adjustment

Solana's current excessively high inflation rate has hindered ecological development, which is precisely why SIMD0228 was proposed. Therefore, adjusting Solana's inflation rate is imperative. But what should the specific adjusted rate be? We can first define several soft conditions to determine the final inflation rate and staking rewards:



① A 2% terminal inflation rate is appropriate.

The U.S. Federal Reserve also endorses this standard: in 2020, it explicitly incorporated the ""Average Inflation Targeting"" framework into its policy system. While it allows short-term inflation to slightly exceed 2% to offset periods of below-target inflation, it maintains 2% as the long-term core anchor, believing this level is most conducive to sustaining stable tokenomic growth. This logic equally applies to the long-term stable development of the Solana ecosystem.



② SOL should avoid deflation.

While SOL deflation may seem to drive price appreciation, we must recognize that Solana, as a high-performance blockchain infrastructure, should derive its value growth primarily from its own ecological development and performance improvements – not deflation. SOL deflation would reduce holders' willingness to deploy SOL in ecological use cases (such as staking, DeFi, and NFT transactions), which would suppress ecological vitality and innovation. Thus, deflation for SOL is undesirable.



③ SOL's staking yield should exceed the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds.

RWA (Real-World Assets) is a current hot trend and will be a key development direction in the future. It also serves as a critical narrative pillar aligned with the ICM strategy, as it will bring massive liquidity to the entire crypto industry and introduce products with real-world risk-free rates of return (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds). Consequently, the Solana ecosystem will inevitably integrate RWA products related to U.S. Treasury bonds.



SOL's staking yield represents the native risk-free rate of return within the Solana ecosystem, and it will inevitably compete with RWA products. Given that U.S. Treasury bonds carry lower risk than Solana staking, SOL's staking yield must exceed that of U.S. Treasury bonds to remain competitive. Since the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds is approximately 4%, SOL's staking yield should ideally surpass this level.



④ Should SOL earmark a portion of inflationary funds for long-term development? (This requires further consideration.)

Would it enhance the attractiveness of the Solana ecosystem if a fixed percentage of the annual inflation rate were set aside as a dedicated treasury, with funds targeted allocated to long-term ecological development and reserved for contingency use? For details on how this treasury should be utilized, please refer to Section 3 below.



# Conclusion:

Based on the above soft conditions and Solana's foundational context, we can design an initial inflation rate of 3% for SOL:



* 0.5% of this rate will be permanently directed to a treasury, ensuring a stable revenue stream for ecological development.
* The remaining 2.5% will be used to reward staking participants.



Currently, Solana's staking ratio stands at 65% – a relatively high level. After the inflation adjustment, some stakers will be incentivized to unstake and redeploy SOL into the ecosystem to pursue higher returns. If the staking ratio stabilizes at 50%, validators can expect an approximate 5% yield, slightly exceeding the yield of U.S. Treasury bonds. This will maintain the healthy operation and attractiveness of the ecosystem.



# 2. Stablecoin Strategy

Solana needs a SOL-collateralized stablecoin.



# Rationale:

At present, the relationship between many public chains and their ecosystems exhibits a zero-sum dynamic. For example, projects like [Pump.Fun](http://Pump.Fun) require SOL as the participation asset for their business model, allowing them to accumulate large amounts of SOL. However, when these projects realize profits, they often sell off SOL to strengthen their own operations – which restricts SOL's inherent growth.



Secondly, SOL's price volatility directly impacts the development of many projects within the Solana ecosystem. The prosperity of the ecosystem is highly correlated with SOL's price, which contradicts real-world pricing mechanisms.



In traditional public companies, business operations (fiat-settled supply and demand systems) and stock markets (equity value systems) are inherently isolated: entity operations determine stock performance, but stock price fluctuations do not directly affect daily operations. For instance, even amid a stock market crisis, Luckin Coffee was able to maintain revenue growth through proactive business operations.



However, the single-token system in the crypto world breaks this isolation: a single token simultaneously serves as the primary medium for the network's commercial scenarios (e.g., gas fees, entry tickets for application participation) and as an investment asset in the capital market.



This creates a risky ""double helix effect"": when the token price rises, market sentiment fuels false ecological prosperity; when the price plummets, developers' incomes decline sharply, leading to difficulties in project operation and maintenance. This is analogous to a project facing operational disruptions solely due to a sharp drop in its token price – a scenario that defies common sense yet is prevalent in the current crypto market.



Therefore, ensuring that project operations are driven by supply-demand dynamics (rather than capital market fluctuations) is a critical challenge for Solana and the broader crypto market.



Replacing the tokens used in commercial scenarios with stablecoins could address both issues mentioned above:



* If Solana's ecological applications widely adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins, cashing out these stablecoins would significantly reduce selling pressure on SOL.
* Meanwhile, SOL's price would no longer disrupt normal business operations, avoiding the double helix effect.



Once a large number of applications adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins for commercial use, a drop in SOL's price will not severely impact their operations. In turn, the stable operation of these ecological projects will provide support for the prices of both SOL and their own tokens.



This strategy will also lock up significant amounts of SOL within such stablecoin applications and spawn derivative applications similar to Curve. Additionally, large-scale stablecoin adoption can integrate with the payment ecosystem: an officially launched Solana Payment App could first support SOL-collateralized stablecoins, followed by USDT/USDC and other mainstream stablecoins.



Furthermore, the ICM strategy includes not only pure financial applications but also scenarios where traditional businesses are implemented via Web3. Such projects typically use stablecoins or fiat currencies (e.g., USD) for transactions. If Solana officially launches a SOL-collateralized stablecoin and establishes a dedicated entity to handle off-chain USD-to-on-chain stablecoin exchanges, it will attract more traditional businesses to Web3-ize their operations on Solana – further enriching the ecosystem.



Most importantly, this stablecoin need not rely solely on SOL as collateral; it can also accept additional assets (e.g., ICM-related assets) as collateral. This would provide a use case for the large capital pools in ICM, enhance the stablecoin's utility by generating additional interest, and attract more users to adopt or hold it – accelerating the development of Solana's stablecoin ecosystem.



# 3. Sustainable Development of SOL

In the real world, a common economic stimulus method involves:



1. Collecting tax revenue into a treasury;
2. Distributing a portion of the treasury as consumption vouchers to encourage spending;
3. Generating new tax revenue through the commercial activities driven by this spending.



This creates a cycle that enables targeted stimulation of desired sectors while ensuring sustainable tokenomic development.



The same logic applies to public chains. Many public chains achieve cold start by launching incentive programs, collaborating with applications to attract users. Early users can earn both public chain rewards and application-specific incentives – a win-win scenario. However, many public chains lack sustainable incentive plans and token value capture mechanisms, leading to insufficient funds for long-term ecological incentives and hindering their long-term growth.



Thus, Solana's development requires a long-term incentive mechanism to achieve sustainability – which is why Section 1 proposes earmarking a portion of inflationary funds for a treasury.



# Specific Uses of the Treasury:

The treasury's 0.5% share of the inflation rate will be allocated to five key areas (the exact percentage for each area can be further deliberated, but establishing such a treasury is essential for providing sustained, direction-driven support to Solana):



① Regular incentives (e.g., quarterly) for users of applications with high TVL and transaction frequency. This is a long-term, permanent incentive direction aimed at increasing long-term SOL lock-up and driving more transaction-based burns – ultimately enhancing SOL's value capture from the ecosystem.



② Periodic incentives for specific sectors: For example, one quarter may prioritize incentives for AI application projects, while the next quarter may focus on high-potential sectors like RWA. This mirrors government-specific funds, which provide targeted support for key industries.



③ Targeted support for projects adopting SOL-collateralized stablecoins: Airdrops will be provided to users of projects with higher stablecoin adoption rates.



④ Targeted support for ICM-aligned projects: Funding will be directed to projects that align with the ICM strategy.



⑤ Development regulatory reserves: These funds will be locked in the treasury long-term and only deployed when the staking ratio is insufficient. Their purpose is to incentivize more participants to stake, ensuring Solana's network security.



# Fine-Tuning the Burn Mechanism

Currently, Solana's burn mechanism operates as follows:



* 50% of base fees are burned, and 50% are distributed to validators;
* 100% of priority fees are distributed to validators.



This mechanism only burns approximately 0.3% of SOL's total supply, making it impossible to achieve the ideal 2% terminal inflation rate.



Priority fees can be viewed as excess returns generated by Solana's network prosperity – and these returns should be aligned with SOL's value. This alignment would tightly bind network prosperity to SOL's value capture.



For these reasons, we propose revising the priority fee distribution to (The specific ratio can be further discussed.):



* 70% to validators,
* 20% burned,
* 10% reverted to the treasury.



This adjustment will enable the treasury to benefit from ecological growth, creating a positive ""recovery-expenditure-recovery"" cycle. It will also enhance SOL's value capture from the ecosystem and, when combined with the treasury's regular incentives, accelerate burns and value capture – ultimately helping achieve the 2% terminal inflation rate target.



# 4. The Necessity and Strategic Significance of Solana's Official Applications

The launch of official applications by public chains will become an inevitable trend, driven by three key factors:

# ① Public chains need to control core applications

Core applications play a crucial role in empowering the public chain's token and ensuring ecological stability. If core applications encounter issues, they can disrupt the development of other ecological projects. Thus, managing these applications in-house (by the public chain team) is optimal.



For example, Aerodrome – the DEX on Base – was co-launched by the Base team and Velodrome, an established DeFi team. Revenue from Aerodrome can be reinvested to support the Base team's operations. Even if Aerodrome faces issues, the public chain team can provide backup support. In contrast, third-party teams may struggle to recover from hacks or even execute rug pulls – resulting in significant ecological losses.



Examples of such core applications include DEXs, over-collateralized stablecoin projects, and Curve-like protocols. These are all suitable for Solana to develop as official, native applications.



# ② Public chains need to ensure core applications empower the native token (which is $SOL, not third-party tokens)

Ecological applications on public chains employ diverse business models and tokenomic mechanisms. Some accumulate large amounts of the public chain's token and lock in profits by selling it (e.g., Pump.Fun), creating selling pressure on SOL.



If Solana officially launches an application with the same functionality as [Pump.Fun](http://Pump.Fun), it can accumulate large amounts of SOL and manage it in ways that minimize ecological impact. For instance:



* The revenue could be reinvested into over-collateralized stablecoin protocols to generate stablecoins, with profits used for ecological development;
* Users could be required to use SOL-collateralized stablecoins to participate in the application.



Such designs would not only reduce negative ecological impacts but also increase demand for SOL and accelerate its value capture.



A relevant case is Virtuals Protocol, which mandates that users use Virtual tokens to participate in its token launches. Additionally, newly issued tokens must form trading pairs with Virtual tokens to be traded. While this design partially stems from Base's lack of a native token, similar models are gaining traction on public chains with native tokens.



Traditionally, new tokens would form trading pairs with the public chain's native token – a standard practice. However, designs like Virtuals' have led many projects to mandate trading pairs with their own tokens instead. This means value that would have been captured by the public chain's token is now siphoned off by third-party application tokens.



To counter this trend, public chain projects must directly compete for ecological empowerment.



# ③ Competitive pressure from other public chains

An increasing number of ""public chain infrastructure + official applications"" combinations are emerging. The competitive edge derived solely from blockchain technology or ecological empowerment is diminishing; many projects are seeking ways to secure sustained external capital support for their blockchains – with exchange empowerment being the most effective and direct method.



Some projects originated as applications and later expanded into public chains to develop their ecosystems. For example, HyperLiquid first launched a permissioned chain-based on-chain contract application, then built an EVM chain to grow its ecosystem – following a ""trading + public chain ecosystem"" logic. This model is being adopted widely: for instance, payment giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm are jointly incubating Tempo, a new blockchain project built specifically for stablecoin payments, which will likely follow a ""payment + public chain ecosystem"" logic.



Additionally, Base Chain and BNBChain are typical examples of ""exchange giant + public chain ecosystem"" combinations, both leveraging CEXs to empower their public chains.



These models share a common trait: public chains are no longer satisfied with growth driven solely by on-chain applications. Instead, they are integrating off-chain cash flow-generating businesses with their ecosystems – importing additional positive external resources.



In the past, Solana's ecosystem was empowered by the FTX exchange, but no such external positive resources currently exist to continuously inject vitality into Solana. Collaborating with another exchange could lead to uncontrollable risks (like the FTX incident). Thus, Solana must build its own positive external empowerment.



# Specific Actions Required:

Solana needs to build a permissioned chain to host an official on-chain exchange (including spot and futures trading – a long-term goal). The rationale for developing this in-house (rather than assembling third-party projects) is that third-party projects cannot be built around SOL's value capture – they issue their own tokens and design business models to empower those tokens instead.



Solana must expand its value capture from ""infrastructure only"" to ""infrastructure + official application suite."" Revenue generated by official applications should be continuously reinvested into Solana's development, creating efficient synergy.



A permissioned chain is necessary (rather than building directly on Solana's mainnet) because only permissioned chains can deliver performance and user experience comparable to CEXs – a key advantage of HyperLiquid.



Furthermore, HyperLiquid's growing success demonstrates that on-chain contract and spot trading will be a key growth market in the future. This market will not be dominated by a single player; new competitors will inevitably emerge. Solana should enter this space early to compete.



Solana's mainnet already hosts substantial capital, users, and projects – an official Solana-based HyperLiquid equivalent could reactivate the ecosystem, similar to how Coinbase empowers Base and Binance empowers BNBChain. Solana needs cash flow-generating applications to provide sustained external positive support for SOL – and it can even develop features that outperform HyperLiquid. For example, traditional institutions' core concerns about entering ICM are ""compliance and security""; an official permissioned chain exchange could address these concerns through ""regulatory alignment + custody guarantees,"" serving as an ""institutional gateway"" to ICM.



This permissioned chain could be co-developed with Solana Layer2 Stack projects (e.g., HyperGrid or Other Layer 2 infrastructure teams, such as Altlayer), or built independently by Solana via its own Layer2 Stack. Developing a Layer2 Stack is critical for the broader ICM narrative, as traditional enterprises and investors typically enter on-chain tokenomic development through two paths:



1. Building applications directly on a public chain;
2. Launching their own managed and controlled Layer2s, then building application ecosystems on these Layer2s.



The latter path is preferred not only for faster speeds and lower fees but also for ""sovereignty"": enterprises can directly control the Layer2's development and avoid disruptions from other Layer1 applications (e.g., Layer1 performance degradation or short-term gas fee surges caused by a popular application). Additionally, Layer2s enable the development of broader application ecosystems (not just single applications) and capture value from these applications. This explains why Robinhood plans to launch a Layer2 and Stripe is developing a Layer1 – sovereign application chains will be a potential future trend, and Solana's Layer2 Stack can fully enable this narrative.



Moreover, Solana's Layer2 can support both SVM and EVM, with potential liquidity interoperability between the two. This will attract projects that require EVM-compatibility but demand lower fees and higher performance – potentially making the migration of Ethereum ecosystems to Solana a new trend. (Solana's growth potential should revolve around the SOL token and its overall network, not exclusively around SVM.)



With an official Layer2 Stack, more application scenarios can be migrated to Layer2: for example, a dedicated chain for Solana's DePIN projects or a specialized chain for payment scenarios – reducing the mainnet's load. Expanding further, Solana could also develop an official bridge to connect these Layer2s; the revenue from this bridge could be reinvested to enhance SOL's value.



However, it is important to note that Layer2 may reduce value capture from fees in the short term. Thus, the highest priority in the early stages should be completing the official permissioned chain (via Layer2 Stack) to launch a Solana-based HyperLiquid equivalent.

# Summary

These strategies are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. They will:



* Introduce new types of applications to enrich Solana's ecosystem;
* Provide diverse value capture mechanisms for SOL, ensuring it correctly captures value from the ecosystem;
* Lay a solid foundation for the effective implementation of the ICM strategy (ICM requires a low-inflation environment to encourage the development of new ICM-aligned applications, and a stable ecosystem will attract more traditional capital to participate in Solana);
* Prepare Solana for future competition, as an increasing number of chains are leveraging exchanges (CEX/DEX/PERP) for empowerment.

If given the opportunity to communicate in depth and gain a better understanding of Solana's future plans, the author is capable of developing more aligned strategies, facilitating their implementation, and validating the author's vision for Web3 development.



# AfterWord

Recently, the BNBChain ecosystem has seen a surge in momentum, and ecosystem activity has experienced a resurgence. While many may view this recent upswing of BNB as merely a short-lived boom, the actual situation is that the industry will develop along two paths:

1. The first path involves the continuous emergence of new hot topics that drive market sentiment, leading to numerous pump-and-dump activities. However, this path will undoubtedly present opportunities for substantial gains, attracting capital, users, and development teams to explore more efficient products and tools around it.
2. The second path focuses on more fundamental inherent needs that better drive industry development, such as directions like RWA (Real-World Assets), AI (Artificial Intelligence), and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks).

For public chains, DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges), and CEXs (Centralized Exchanges), the optimal approach is to actively embrace both paths. Therefore, Solana can, to a certain extent, draw lessons from BNBChain’s experience in the first path while exploring the second path based on its own unique advantages.

This article represents some reflections on the second path. Of course, the strategy mentioned in this article is only the first step; once this first step is truly taken, there will be a second-phase strategy. I hope to have the opportunity to share more about it in the future.



# Answers to Some Questions

**Q: Is this approach too centralized?**

A: For a public chain, technology can be decentralized, but operationally, a central guiding force is needed to steer its development. Otherwise, it may well be eliminated in the fierce competition. Therefore, a certain degree of centralized operation is acceptable.

**Q: Regarding the revised data mentioned in the article, are there more appropriate data points available?**

A: The data is definitely not final and requires further discussion, but the overall operational logic is relatively certain. The development pattern of the industry will most likely make public chains, DEXs, and CEXs competitors to one another. Hence, it is necessary to make preparations and plans early.

**Q: The article mentions many applications, such as stablecoin protocols, for which there are already existing projects. Why is there still a need for the official team to develop one?**

A: SOL-based stablecoin protocols will be among the most important DeFi financial infrastructures and are closely tied to SOL. They need to be overseen by the official team. Because if it were a third-party protocol, the development of that protocol would be aimed at its own growth and would not prioritize the impact on SOL. In contrast, if developed by the official team, the economic flows within it can drive capital repurchases and redistribution for SOL.

The U.S. Federal Reserve also endorses this standard: in 2020, it explicitly incorporated the ""Average Inflation Targeting"" framework into its policy system. While it allows short-term inflation to slightly exceed 2% to offset periods of below-target inflation, it maintains 2% as the long-term core anchor, believing this level is most conducive to sustaining stable tokenomic growth. This logic equally applies to the long-term stable development of the Solana ecosystem.



② SOL should avoid deflation.

While SOL deflation may seem to drive price appreciation, we must recognize that Solana, as a high-performance blockchain infrastructure, should derive its value growth primarily from its own ecological development and performance improvements – not deflation. SOL deflation would reduce holders' willingness to deploy SOL in ecological use cases (such as staking, DeFi, and NFT transactions), which would suppress ecological vitality and innovation. Thus, deflation for SOL is undesirable.



③ SOL's staking yield should exceed the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds.

RWA (Real-World Assets) is a current hot trend and will be a key development direction in the future. It also serves as a critical narrative pillar aligned with the ICM strategy, as it will bring massive liquidity to the entire crypto industry and introduce products with real-world risk-free rates of return (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds). Consequently, the Solana ecosystem will inevitably integrate RWA products related to U.S. Treasury bonds.



SOL's staking yield represents the native risk-free rate of return within the Solana ecosystem, and it will inevitably compete with RWA products. Given that U.S. Treasury bonds carry lower risk than Solana staking, SOL's staking yield must exceed that of U.S. Treasury bonds to remain competitive. Since the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds is approximately 4%, SOL's staking yield should ideally surpass this level.



④ Should SOL earmark a portion of inflationary funds for long-term development? (This requires further consideration.)

Would it enhance the attractiveness of the Solana ecosystem if a fixed percentage of the annual inflation rate were set aside as a dedicated treasury, with funds targeted allocated to long-term ecological development and reserved for contingency use? For details on how this treasury should be utilized, please refer to Section 3 below.



# Conclusion:

Based on the above soft conditions and Solana's foundational context, we can design an initial inflation rate of 3% for SOL:



* 0.5% of this rate will be permanently directed to a treasury, ensuring a stable revenue stream for ecological development.
* The remaining 2.5% will be used to reward staking participants.



Currently, Solana's staking ratio stands at 65% – a relatively high level. After the inflation adjustment, some stakers will be incentivized to unstake and redeploy SOL into the ecosystem to pursue higher returns. If the staking ratio stabilizes at 50%, validators can expect an approximate 5% yield, slightly exceeding the yield of U.S. Treasury bonds. This will maintain the healthy operation and attractiveness of the ecosystem.



# 2. Stablecoin Strategy

Solana needs a SOL-collateralized stablecoin.



# Rationale:

At present, the relationship between many public chains and their ecosystems exhibits a zero-sum dynamic. For example, projects like [Pump.Fun](http://Pump.Fun) require SOL as the participation asset for their business model, allowing them to accumulate large amounts of SOL. However, when these projects realize profits, they often sell off SOL to strengthen their own operations – which restricts SOL's inherent growth.



Secondly, SOL's price volatility directly impacts the development of many projects within the Solana ecosystem. The prosperity of the ecosystem is highly correlated with SOL's price, which contradicts real-world pricing mechanisms.



In traditional public companies, business operations (fiat-settled supply and demand systems) and stock markets (equity value systems) are inherently isolated: entity operations determine stock performance, but stock price fluctuations do not directly affect daily operations. For instance, even amid a stock market crisis, Luckin Coffee was able to maintain revenue growth through proactive business operations.



However, the single-token system in the crypto world breaks this isolation: a single token simultaneously serves as the primary medium for the network's commercial scenarios (e.g., gas fees, entry tickets for application participation) and as an investment asset in the capital market.



This creates a risky ""double helix effect"": when the token price rises, market sentiment fuels false ecological prosperity; when the price plummets, developers' incomes decline sharply, leading to difficulties in project operation and maintenance. This is analogous to a project facing operational disruptions solely due to a sharp drop in its token price – a scenario that defies common sense yet is prevalent in the current crypto market.



Therefore, ensuring that project operations are driven by supply-demand dynamics (rather than capital market fluctuations) is a critical challenge for Solana and the broader crypto market.



Replacing the tokens used in commercial scenarios with stablecoins could address both issues mentioned above:



* If Solana's ecological applications widely adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins, cashing out these stablecoins would significantly reduce selling pressure on SOL.
* Meanwhile, SOL's price would no longer disrupt normal business operations, avoiding the double helix effect.



Once a large number of applications adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins for commercial use, a drop in SOL's price will not severely impact their operations. In turn, the stable operation of these ecological projects will provide support for the prices of both SOL and their own tokens.



This strategy will also lock up significant amounts of SOL within such stablecoin applications and spawn derivative applications similar to Curve. Additionally, large-scale stablecoin adoption can integrate with the payment ecosystem: an officially launched Solana Payment App could first support SOL-collateralized stablecoins, followed by USDT/USDC and other mainstream stablecoins.



Furthermore, the ICM strategy includes not only pure financial applications but also scenarios where traditional businesses are implemented via Web3. Such projects typically use stablecoins or fiat currencies (e.g., USD) for transactions. If Solana officially launches a SOL-collateralized stablecoin and establishes a dedicated entity to handle off-chain USD-to-on-chain stablecoin exchanges, it will attract more traditional businesses to Web3-ize their operations on Solana – further enriching the ecosystem.



Most importantly, this stablecoin need not rely solely on SOL as collateral; it can also accept additional assets (e.g., ICM-related assets) as collateral. This would provide a use case for the large capital pools in ICM, enhance the stablecoin's utility by generating additional interest, and attract more users to adopt or hold it – accelerating the development of Solana's stablecoin ecosystem.



# 3. Sustainable Development of SOL

In the real world, a common economic stimulus method involves:



1. Collecting tax revenue into a treasury;
2. Distributing a portion of the treasury as consumption vouchers to encourage spending;
3. Generating new tax revenue through the commercial activities driven by this spending.



This creates a cycle that enables targeted stimulation of desired sectors while ensuring sustainable tokenomic development.



The same logic applies to public chains. Many public chains achieve cold start by launching incentive programs, collaborating with applications to attract users. Early users can earn both public chain rewards and application-specific incentives – a win-win scenario. However, many public chains lack sustainable incentive plans and token value capture mechanisms, leading to insufficient funds for long-term ecological incentives and hindering their long-term growth.



Thus, Solana's development requires a long-term incentive mechanism to achieve sustainability – which is why Section 1 proposes earmarking a portion of inflationary funds for a treasury.



# Specific Uses of the Treasury:

The treasury's 0.5% share of the inflation rate will be allocated to five key areas (the exact percentage for each area can be further deliberated, but establishing such a treasury is essential for providing sustained, direction-driven support to Solana):



① Regular incentives (e.g., quarterly) for users of applications with high TVL and transaction frequency. This is a long-term, permanent incentive direction aimed at increasing long-term SOL lock-up and driving more transaction-based burns – ultimately enhancing SOL's value capture from the ecosystem.



② Periodic incentives for specific sectors: For example, one quarter may prioritize incentives for AI application projects, while the next quarter may focus on high-potential sectors like RWA. This mirrors government-specific funds, which provide targeted support for key industries.



③ Targeted support for projects adopting SOL-collateralized stablecoins: Airdrops will be provided to users of projects with higher stablecoin adoption rates.



④ Targeted support for ICM-aligned projects: Funding will be directed to projects that align with the ICM strategy.



⑤ Development regulatory reserves: These funds will be locked in the treasury long-term and only deployed when the staking ratio is insufficient. Their purpose is to incentivize more participants to stake, ensuring Solana's network security.



# Fine-Tuning the Burn Mechanism

Currently, Solana's burn mechanism operates as follows:



* 50% of base fees are burned, and 50% are distributed to validators;
* 100% of priority fees are distributed to validators.



This mechanism only burns approximately 0.3% of SOL's total supply, making it impossible to achieve the ideal 2% terminal inflation rate.



Priority fees can be viewed as excess returns generated by Solana's network prosperity – and these returns should be aligned with SOL's value. This alignment would tightly bind network prosperity to SOL's value capture.



For these reasons, we propose revising the priority fee distribution to (The specific ratio can be further discussed.):



* 70% to validators,
* 20% burned,
* 10% reverted to the treasury.



This adjustment will enable the treasury to benefit from ecological growth, creating a positive ""recovery-expenditure-recovery"" cycle. It will also enhance SOL's value capture from the ecosystem and, when combined with the treasury's regular incentives, accelerate burns and value capture – ultimately helping achieve the 2% terminal inflation rate target.



# 4. The Necessity and Strategic Significance of Solana's Official Applications

The launch of official applications by public chains will become an inevitable trend, driven by three key factors:

# ① Public chains need to control core applications

Core applications play a crucial role in empowering the public chain's token and ensuring ecological stability. If core applications encounter issues, they can disrupt the development of other ecological projects. Thus, managing these applications in-house (by the public chain team) is optimal.



For example, Aerodrome – the DEX on Base – was co-launched by the Base team and Velodrome, an established DeFi team. Revenue from Aerodrome can be reinvested to support the Base team's operations. Even if Aerodrome faces issues, the public chain team can provide backup support. In contrast, third-party teams may struggle to recover from hacks or even execute rug pulls – resulting in significant ecological losses.



Examples of such core applications include DEXs, over-collateralized stablecoin projects, and Curve-like protocols. These are all suitable for Solana to develop as official, native applications.



# ② Public chains need to ensure core applications empower the native token (which is $SOL, not third-party tokens)

Ecological applications on public chains employ diverse business models and tokenomic mechanisms. Some accumulate large amounts of the public chain's token and lock in profits by selling it (e.g., Pump.Fun), creating selling pressure on SOL.



If Solana officially launches an application with the same functionality as [Pump.Fun](http://Pump.Fun), it can accumulate large amounts of SOL and manage it in ways that minimize ecological impact. For instance:



* The revenue could be reinvested into over-collateralized stablecoin protocols to generate stablecoins, with profits used for ecological development;
* Users could be required to use SOL-collateralized stablecoins to participate in the application.



Such designs would not only reduce negative ecological impacts but also increase demand for SOL and accelerate its value capture.



A relevant case is Virtuals Protocol, which mandates that users use Virtual tokens to participate in its token launches. Additionally, newly issued tokens must form trading pairs with Virtual tokens to be traded. While this design partially stems from Base's lack of a native token, similar models are gaining traction on public chains with native tokens.



Traditionally, new tokens would form trading pairs with the public chain's native token – a standard practice. However, designs like Virtuals' have led many projects to mandate trading pairs with their own tokens instead. This means value that would have been captured by the public chain's token is now siphoned off by third-party application tokens.



To counter this trend, public chain projects must directly compete for ecological empowerment.



# ③ Competitive pressure from other public chains

An increasing number of ""public chain infrastructure + official applications"" combinations are emerging. The competitive edge derived solely from blockchain technology or ecological empowerment is diminishing; many projects are seeking ways to secure sustained external capital support for their blockchains – with exchange empowerment being the most effective and direct method.



Some projects originated as applications and later expanded into public chains to develop their ecosystems. For example, HyperLiquid first launched a permissioned chain-based on-chain contract application, then built an EVM chain to grow its ecosystem – following a ""trading + public chain ecosystem"" logic. This model is being adopted widely: for instance, payment giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm are jointly incubating Tempo, a new blockchain project built specifically for stablecoin payments, which will likely follow a ""payment + public chain ecosystem"" logic.



Additionally, Base Chain and BNBChain are typical examples of ""exchange giant + public chain ecosystem"" combinations, both leveraging CEXs to empower their public chains.



These models share a common trait: public chains are no longer satisfied with growth driven solely by on-chain applications. Instead, they are integrating off-chain cash flow-generating businesses with their ecosystems – importing additional positive external resources.



In the past, Solana's ecosystem was empowered by the FTX exchange, but no such external positive resources currently exist to continuously inject vitality into Solana. Collaborating with another exchange could lead to uncontrollable risks (like the FTX incident). Thus, Solana must build its own positive external empowerment.



# Specific Actions Required:

Solana needs to build a permissioned chain to host an official on-chain exchange (including spot and futures trading – a long-term goal). The rationale for developing this in-house (rather than assembling third-party projects) is that third-party projects cannot be built around SOL's value capture – they issue their own tokens and design business models to empower those tokens instead.



Solana must expand its value capture from ""infrastructure only"" to ""infrastructure + official application suite."" Revenue generated by official applications should be continuously reinvested into Solana's development, creating efficient synergy.



A permissioned chain is necessary (rather than building directly on Solana's mainnet) because only permissioned chains can deliver performance and user experience comparable to CEXs – a key advantage of HyperLiquid.



Furthermore, HyperLiquid's growing success demonstrates that on-chain contract and spot trading will be a key growth market in the future. This market will not be dominated by a single player; new competitors will inevitably emerge. Solana should enter this space early to compete.



Solana's mainnet already hosts substantial capital, users, and projects – an official Solana-based HyperLiquid equivalent could reactivate the ecosystem, similar to how Coinbase empowers Base and Binance empowers BNBChain. Solana needs cash flow-generating applications to provide sustained external positive support for SOL – and it can even develop features that outperform HyperLiquid. For example, traditional institutions' core concerns about entering ICM are ""compliance and security""; an official permissioned chain exchange could address these concerns through ""regulatory alignment + custody guarantees,"" serving as an ""institutional gateway"" to ICM.



This permissioned chain could be co-developed with Solana Layer2 Stack projects (e.g., HyperGrid or Other Layer 2 infrastructure teams, such as Altlayer), or built independently by Solana via its own Layer2 Stack. Developing a Layer2 Stack is critical for the broader ICM narrative, as traditional enterprises and investors typically enter on-chain tokenomic development through two paths:



1. Building applications directly on a public chain;
2. Launching their own managed and controlled Layer2s, then building application ecosystems on these Layer2s.



The latter path is preferred not only for faster speeds and lower fees but also for ""sovereignty"": enterprises can directly control the Layer2's development and avoid disruptions from other Layer1 applications (e.g., Layer1 performance degradation or short-term gas fee surges caused by a popular application). Additionally, Layer2s enable the development of broader application ecosystems (not just single applications) and capture value from these applications. This explains why Robinhood plans to launch a Layer2 and Stripe is developing a Layer1 – sovereign application chains will be a potential future trend, and Solana's Layer2 Stack can fully enable this narrative.



Moreover, Solana's Layer2 can support both SVM and EVM, with potential liquidity interoperability between the two. This will attract projects that require EVM-compatibility but demand lower fees and higher performance – potentially making the migration of Ethereum ecosystems to Solana a new trend. (Solana's growth potential should revolve around the SOL token and its overall network, not exclusively around SVM.)



With an official Layer2 Stack, more application scenarios can be migrated to Layer2: for example, a dedicated chain for Solana's DePIN projects or a specialized chain for payment scenarios – reducing the mainnet's load. Expanding further, Solana could also develop an official bridge to connect these Layer2s; the revenue from this bridge could be reinvested to enhance SOL's value.



However, it is important to note that Layer2 may reduce value capture from fees in the short term. Thus, the highest priority in the early stages should be completing the official permissioned chain (via Layer2 Stack) to launch a Solana-based HyperLiquid equivalent.

# Summary

These strategies are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. They will:



* Introduce new types of applications to enrich Solana's ecosystem;
* Provide diverse value capture mechanisms for SOL, ensuring it correctly captures value from the ecosystem;
* Lay a solid foundation for the effective implementation of the ICM strategy (ICM requires a low-inflation environment to encourage the development of new ICM-aligned applications, and a stable ecosystem will attract more traditional capital to participate in Solana);
* Prepare Solana for future competition, as an increasing number of chains are leveraging exchanges (CEX/DEX/PERP) for empowerment.



Note: The strategic insights presented in this article reflect the author's current views. If given the opportunity to communicate in depth and gain a better understanding of Solana's future plans, the author is capable of developing more aligned strategies, facilitating their implementation, and validating the author's vision for Web3 development.



# AfterWord

Recently, the BNBChain ecosystem has seen a surge in momentum, and ecosystem activity has experienced a resurgence. While many may view this recent upswing of BNB as merely a short-lived boom, the actual situation is that the industry will develop along two paths:

1. The first path involves the continuous emergence of new hot topics that drive market sentiment, leading to numerous pump-and-dump activities. However, this path will undoubtedly present opportunities for substantial gains, attracting capital, users, and development teams to explore more efficient products and tools around it.
2. The second path focuses on more fundamental inherent needs that better drive industry development, such as directions like RWA (Real-World Assets), AI (Artificial Intelligence), and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks).

For public chains, DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges), and CEXs (Centralized Exchanges), the optimal approach is to actively embrace both paths. Therefore, Solana can, to a certain extent, draw lessons from BNBChain’s experience in the first path while exploring the second path based on its own unique advantages.

This article represents some reflections on the second path. Of course, the strategy mentioned in this article is only the first step; once this first step is truly taken, there will be a second-phase strategy. I hope to have the opportunity to share more about it in the future.



# Answers to Some Questions

**Q: Is this approach too centralized?**

A: For a public chain, technology can be decentralized, but operationally, a central guiding force is needed to steer its development. Otherwise, it may well be eliminated in the fierce competition. Therefore, a certain degree of centralized operation is acceptable.

**Q: Regarding the revised data mentioned in the article, are there more appropriate data points available?**

A: The data is definitely not final and requires further discussion, but the overall operational logic is relatively certain. The development pattern of the industry will most likely make public chains, DEXs, and CEXs competitors to one another. Hence, it is necessary to make preparations and plans early.

**Q: The article mentions many applications, such as stablecoin protocols, for which there are already existing projects. Why is there still a need for the official team to develop one?**

A: SOL-based stablecoin protocols will be among the most important DeFi financial infrastructures and are closely tied to SOL. They need to be overseen by the official team. Because if it were a third-party protocol, the development of that protocol would be aimed at its own growth and would not prioritize the impact on SOL. In contrast, if developed by the official team, the economic flows within it can drive capital repurchases and redistribution for SOL.

Investors should monitor the progress of the Alpenglow testnet (December 2025) and mainnet (Q1 2026), as well as ETF regulatory developments^(71).



I've previously researched this using AI, and I'd like to share it with you. I'm not sure what tariffs have to do with Solana, or any blockchain for that matter. Solana, which is generating high revenue year-over-year and doubling in growth, is currently significantly undervalued. Solana is not a risky asset.



Solana holds the second-largest DeFi TVL at $11.06B and boasts a DEX daily trading volume of $6.16B, overwhelming all other chains. It boasts unparalleled developers and protocols like Jupiter, Raydium, Sanctum, Backpack, and Helius. It also boasts a diverse portfolio of 2.4 million daily active users, ranking among the top Layer 1s and handling a high daily throughput of 77.9 million transactions.



Furthermore, its staking rate is as high as 67%. Once you start using the Solana ecosystem, you'll likely find yourself avoiding other layers due to the convenience it offers.



While it's true that reliability is an issue due to a history of downtime, many developers have researched and worked hard to minimize the issues, and we're now seeing Solana handle extremely high traffic levels much better than before.



Furthermore, we're currently working to upgrade to Alpenglow, ensuring even greater speed, stability, and security.



More importantly, not only Solana, but all on-chain protocols are unrelated to tariffs. Everything that happens on the blockchain has absolutely nothing to do with tariffs. Why should the price drop so absurdly due to tariff news?

Remember when interacting with Solana dApps meant:

* Phantom constantly disconnecting
* Transactions timing out 50% of the time
* Zero visibility into what's happening on-chain

Now? Multi-chain tools are actually treating Solana as a first-class citizen, not an afterthought.

Example: was testing Banana Pro recently for on-chain automation. It's cross-chain (ETH + SOL), but the Solana implementation is genuinely smoother than the EVM side. Fast confirmations, minimal friction, no bridge nonsense.

The fact that you can now build UIs on Solana that feel like... normal web apps (not ""please approve 5 transactions and pray"") is a huge shift.

What I'm noticing:

Wallet integrations are stable now (Phantom, Backpack, Solflare all work consistently)

Transaction simulation before signing is becoming standard

Gas fees still mog everything else (even during high congestion)

Question for builders here: What Solana-native tools are you using that you wish existed 2 years ago? Feels like we're finally at the point where UX isn't the main barrier anymore.",Wallet/Exchange,True,,False

[@Spacemandev](https://x.com/spacemandev) of Cohort 3's [@Seedplex\_io](https://x.com/seedplex_io) sat down with [@Yrschrade](https://x.com/yrschrade) to understand how [@ArciumHQ](https://x.com/ArciumHQ) is unlocking encrypted capital markets on [@Solana](https://x.com/solana) — and it's way bigger than just privacy.  
  
Full interview 👇+ 🧵

>**2/** [@ArciumHQ](https://x.com/ArciumHQ) is the encrypted execution engine for Solana. Here's what makes it different:  
Privacy 1.0 (ZK Proofs): Isolated encrypted state   
Privacy 2.0 (Arcium): Encrypted SHARED state  
  
This unlocks an entirely new design space.



>**3/** What this enables on Solana:  
  
✓ Dark pools & encrypted capital markets   
✓ Confidential lending protocols   
✓ Smart order routing across multiple dark venues   
✓ Onchain programs managing confidential token balances   
✓ Private AI training & inference with proprietary models



>**4/** Key tech breakthroughs:  
  
• 16,000x faster than FHE   
• Runs on basic hardware (no TEEs needed)   
• Dishonest majority security (only needs 1-of-n honest nodes)   
• MPC protocol you can actually build with   
• Write Rust, get encryption.   
  
All in a trustless, decentralized way



>**5/** Arcium works where privacy chains fail because it's a network extension on Solana, not its own L1.  
  
That means it can:  
  
\- Tap Solana's existing liquidity from day one  
\- Avoid cold start problem for dev adoption  
\- Switch between public and private execution



>**6/** The institutional unlock is massive.   
  
Institutions can now:   
  
• Park millions without exposing P&L   
• Trade confidentially while tapping Solana's public liquidity   
• Access TradFi-style confidential trading venues onchain



>**7/** Timeline:  
  
Mainnet Alpha: Q4 2025/Q1 2026   
Mainnet Beta: Fully permissionless nodes coming soon  
  
Teams building: [@UmbraHQ](https://x.com/UmbraHQ)  \- incognito mode for Solana

>Cohort 2’s [@CrunchDAO](https://x.com/crunchDAO) \- encrypted ML/AI

>Cohort 3’s [@Seedplex\_io](https://x.com/seedplex_io) \- democratized, private access to early stage equities

solana,1obp2e8,"Solana's Big Upgrade: New 'P-Token' Program Promises Up to 98% Compute Savings, Boosting Network Throughput by 12%",SolBrothers_,2025-10-20T19:04:02,24,0.96,6,https://i.redd.it/80e3zm3t3bwf1.jpeg,https://reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1obp2e8/solanas_big_upgrade_new_ptoken_program_promises/,"If you're tired of those pesky compute unit (CU) limits cramping your DeFi dreams, we've got some seriously bullish news straight from Anza. Today, they dropped a game-changing proposal (SIMD-0266) to overhaul the SPL Token Program with a hyper-efficient replacement called p-token. Authored by 0x\_febo, this upgrade could slash token operation costs by up to 98%, freeing up nearly 12% of block space for more transactions. That's right—Solana's already blazing-fast network just got a turbo boost on paper.

Why This Matters: More Txns, Less FrictionRight now, about 10% of Solana's block compute units are gobbled up by token instructions alone. With p-token, those costs drop dramatically, directly pumping up the chain's effective throughput. Imagine running complex DeFi flows—swaps, transfers, mints—without hitting CU walls as often. This isn't just a tweak; it's a direct capacity unlock that plays nice with other upgrades like 100M CU blocks and higher account limits.  
The Tech Breakdown: Efficiency Without the HeadacheP-token is a full reimplementation of the SPL Token Program, but don't worry—it's 100% backward compatible. No code changes needed for clients or dApps; it's a drop-in replacement. Here's what makes it tick:

* No heap allocations: Ditches memory overhead for leaner ops.
* Zero-copy data access: Reads data straight from accounts without unnecessary copying.
* New killer instructions:
   * Batch: Bundle multiple token ops into one cross-program invocation (CPI).
   * UnwrapLamports: Skip creating temp native accounts for lamport handling.

Check out this chart from Anza showing the CU smackdown across common instructions (P-Token in green vs. SPL in purple):

|Instruction|SPL Token CUs|P-Token CUs|% Savings|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TransferChecked|6,200|105|98%|
|Transfer|4,645|76|98%|
|CloseAccount|4,240|120|97%|
|InitializeAccount3|2,916|248|92%|
|InitializeImmutableOwner|3,045|1,404|54%|
|SyncNative|381|38|90%|
|InitializeAccount|4,527|154|97%|

Neodyme's audit replayed mainnet transactions and confirmed p-token spits out identical results to the current SPL program. No funny business—just pure efficiency gains. This could supercharge everything from Jupiter swaps to custom AMMs, making Solana even more dev-friendly.

solana,1oauyce,Solana is the most undervalued asset in crypto and the market has not priced it correctly,outsideisfun,2025-10-19T18:05:04,262,0.84,207,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1oauyce/solana_is_the_most_undervalued_asset_in_crypto/,https://reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1oauyce/solana_is_the_most_undervalued_asset_in_crypto/,">**TL;DR:** Solana should realistically be worth between 1,000 and 3,000 per coin based on adoption, usage, and network economics. As of writing this, it trades under 200 and will likely fall lower during the coming market retrace. That will not be a crash. It will be the best asymmetric opportunity in crypto in the next 2 to 3 years. If you do not understand why yet, this post explains the fundamentals behind that valuation and why the current market still severely misprices Solana.

Solana should already be worth 1,000 based on utility alone. That will sound dramatic to people who think in headlines rather than data, but the reality is simple. Price does not move first. Usage moves first. Price catches up. The Solana network has already entered the phase where reality is far ahead of its valuation. The repricing has not started yet.

This is not a meme or a hype cycle pitch. Solana sits at the intersection of three truths. It has real users. It has real throughput. It has real developer activity. Crypto is finally maturing into an industry where capital follows usage. Usage follows scalability. Scalability drives liquidity. Liquidity drives market caps. Solana is ahead of everyone except Bitcoin and Ethereum, yet it is still priced like a high beta speculation token rather than what it actually is, which is a core piece of blockchain infrastructure.

# What Solana actually is

Solana is often mischaracterized as a faster version of Ethereum. That is incorrect and outdated thinking. Solana is a monolithic high performance execution layer. Ethereum is evolving into a modular settlement system that relies on external rollups and bridges. These differences are not cosmetic. They produce entirely different network behaviors and application capabilities.

Ethereum will remain the preferred environment for high value settlement and institutional DeFi. Solana is built for scalable real time transactions and consumer level blockchain applications. It is the first chain to function like an actual financial engine rather than a slow L1 base layer. This is why activity on Solana looks nothing like a typical altcoin. The network actually runs.

# Usage explains the mispricing

Networks with real activity eventually dominate market cap rankings, but it does not happen instantly. For months, even years, there is a lag where usage metrics separate sharply from price. That is where Solana is now.

Some relevant facts:

* Solana is consistently one of the top blockchains in daily active users and frequently ranks #1 by real users when filtering out spam activity.
* Transaction throughput and volume are sustained by real usage, including DeFi, trading, payments, and consumer apps.
* Solana has one of the fastest growing developer ecosystems in crypto.
* On-chain DEX volume regularly competes with and sometimes *exceeds* Ethereum, especially during high volatility periods.
* Liquidity depth and market integration have been *increasing* month over month, with more institutional-grade market makers participating.
* Solana has more active users than all major Ethereum L2s *combined* during most periods.
* The current price still reflects outdated skepticism from the 2022 era, while on-chain metrics show network growth and adoption.

# Common criticisms are outdated or wrong.

The majority of pushback against Solana is based on narratives rather than facts. The three most common objections are easy to address.

**Centralization**  
Solana has one of the largest validator sets in crypto and a high Nakamoto coefficient. It is more decentralized in practice than every rollup and sidechain that depends on a multisig or sequencer. It is decentralized enough for open global finance. Anything beyond that is philosophy.

**Venture capital control**  
VC unlocks are already behind us. Distribution has decentralized through open markets. If VC presence was a problem, then nearly every large crypto project would also be invalid.

**Outages**  
The network had performance failures during its early period. They were fixed. The improvements now include local fee markets, quality of service rules, and a second independent validator client from Jump Crypto called Firedancer.

None of these arguments hold up. They only persist as talking points for people who stopped learning about Solana back in 2021.

# Unified liquidity is a critical advantage

Solana has a single shared state. All applications operate in one place. There is no fragmentation by design. Liquidity moves freely across the network. Ethereum is pursuing modular scaling through L2s and rollups which introduces risk, synchronization delays, fragmented liquidity, and user friction. The experience of bridging funds across multiple networks is not sustainable for mass adoption. Solana avoids this problem entirely.

# Institutional flow will enter Solana

Capital rotates in predictable patterns. Bitcoin first, Ethereum second, high conviction L1 third. That third position used to be a rotating story. Cardano, Polkadot, Avalanche all had their brief window. None developed real network effects. Solana did. It now has the liquidity depth and exchange integration required for institutional accumulation. Once the regulatory structure catches up, it will be added to portfolio models the same way Ethereum was in 2020.

# Timeline and price logic

Solana is not a 10 year hold to maybe see returns. It is a 2 to 3 year asymmetric play with a structural repricing window. If Solana captures a reasonable percentage of on-chain global transaction flow then a fair market value is

* 1,000 at approximately 440 billion market cap
* 2,000 at approximately 880 billion market cap
* 3,000 at approximately 1.3 trillion market cap

These numbers are realistic inside a 10 trillion total crypto market by 2027 or earlier. Network effects always look impossible until they become obvious. There was a time when people thought Ethereum would never reach a 500 billion market cap. That era is over. The same disbelief now sits in front of Solana.

# The window will not stay open

There will be a bear market before Solana reprices. That bear market will take Solana under current prices. That decline will cause retail holders to exit and panic. That event will not change the long term thesis. It will not impact the network. It will not reverse adoption. It will simply transfer supply from weak hands to strong ones.

The correct strategy over the next 2 to 3 years is accumulation, not reaction. For me, that means steady purchasing and staking through Phantom. I am not trading Solana. I am building position weight and yield. Whether price goes down or up in the short term is irrelevant to the thesis.

Solana has already won the application layer. Transactions, developers, liquidity, products, integrations, and user adoption all confirm this. The only area that has not yet moved is price. That will change during the next expansion cycle. Market disbelief will disappear. Analysts will begin publishing revised price targets. Institutions will include Solana in their allocation models. It will go from a high conviction play to a consensus trade. By that time, the entry window will be gone.

Solana should already be worth 1,000. It will get there. The only question is who will hold it when it does.

The transaction is confirmed on the Solana blockchain, and the USDT is sitting at that address. I do **not** have access to the private key or seed phrase, as the wallet was generated and displayed by PayPal.

I contacted PayPal support, and they confirmed that the wallet is under their control, but they don’t support USDT on Solana and don’t have a technical team to recover unsupported assets. They said the funds are “inaccessible” and may be lost unless they add support in the future.

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Is there any way to escalate this or recover the funds? I’m open to any suggestions.",Wallet/Exchange,True,,False

# 🛠️ Toolapalooza

Toolapalooza is a day-long developer event hosted by Turbin3, happening on October 18, 2025. The event brings together maintainers and experts behind key Solana developer tools for a series of focused workshops. 

Each session follows a “5W-How” format, walking through what the tool is, why it matters, who uses it, where and when it fits into development, and how to use it effectively. 

The goal is to give developers a clear, practical understanding of Solana’s core tools straight from the people who build and maintain them.

Toolapalooza will have sessions on tools including:

* MagicBlock
* Switchboard
* Vixen
* LiteSVM
* Surfpool
* Carbon
* Codama
* Gill SDK 

Toolapalooza is structured to make learning hands-on so participants can see how tools connect within the Solana developer experience. 

The event is free and will be livestreamed on YouTube.

# 🔗 SBPF Linker

A big change for Solana developers has arrived with SBPF Linker built by Blueshift.

Until now, building programs on Solana required a custom Rust toolchain and Solana-specific build commands such as `build-sbf`. This approach relied on a forked version of Rust and LLVM that maintained Solana’s BPF target separately from the official open-source repos. 

This creates challenges for developers like nonstandard workflows, compatibility issues when updating toolchains, and extra setup steps for those already familiar with Rust.

The new SBPF Linker changes that. 

It acts as an upstream BPF linker that can take standard BPF binaries compiled with nightly Rust and relink them into a format compatible with Solana’s SBPF v0 runtime. 

This means developers can now use the standard Rust compiler and ecosystem tools without switching toolchains or learning new commands. Solana programs can be built with regular Rust tooling while remaining fully compatible with the Solana blockchain.

By removing the need for a custom toolchain, the process of building and maintaining Solana programs becomes simpler, faster, and more in line with conventional Rust development practices.

[**SBPF Linker Annoucement**](https://x.com/blueshift_gg/status/1977273680100237341?ref=blog.colosseum.com)

# 🐟 GitFish v2

GitFish v2 offers a new way to fund open source projects through tokenized backing. 

Each GitHub repo is represented by a single coin, and anyone can launch a coin for a project they believe in. Launching costs a set number of points based on a project’s popularity, measured by GitHub stars.

Coins generate value through attention and trading fees, creating a funding stream for verified project maintainers. Maintainers can link their GitHub accounts to claim earnings and reinvest in their projects. 

Launching is free for project owners, while other users pay in points and earn 0.1% of trading fees for coins they create. Points are earned by interacting on GitFish through trading, tipping, or completing quests.

By connecting GitHub activity to Solana’s blockchain economy, GitFish’s goal is to create a new way for open source projects to receive ongoing support to maintain their project's development.

[**GitFish**](https://www.gitfish.dev/?ref=blog.colosseum.com)

# 📘 LiteSVM Docs

LiteSVM has a new documentation site designed to help Solana developers learn how to easily test and debug onchain programs using LiteSVM. 

The site includes detailed guides, usage examples, and links to example repos that integrate LiteSVM into Anchor-based projects.

LiteSVM is a lightweight library for testing Solana programs that runs an in-process Solana Virtual Machine optimized for developers. 

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on external validator processes, LiteSVM embeds the VM directly into test environments, allowing tests to run faster with flexible configuration options for advanced use cases.

The new documentation site centralizes resources and examples to help developers quickly integrate LiteSVM into their workflow, improving both the speed and reliability of Solana program testing.

# How to track your Seeker activity and why it might be worth doing something every day

✍️ [@solace\_fm](https://x.com/@solace_fm)

On top of the wealth of boosts and rewards delivered so far in Seeker Season, Solana Mobile has dropped yet another curious Easter Egg.

A recently unveiled tab in the Seed Vault Wallet enables users to track their participation in the Seeker ecosystem, hinting at future rewards for more engaged participants.

How can you turn on Seeker activity tracking, what counts towards measuring participation, and why should you care?

# Why Might Solana Mobile Want to Measure Your Activity?

Think back to May 2025, when Solana Mobile GM Emmett Hollyer [took the stage at Solana Accelerate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6MLVur2nME&t=2s)

and unveiled the vision for a fully decentralized, economic flywheel. Powered by [$SKR](https://x.com/search?q=%24SKR&src=cashtag_click), the Seeker economy is engineered to reward developers and contributors, while empowering token holders to govern the direction of one of crypto’s most ambitious experiments.

The announcement of [$SKR](https://x.com/search?q=%24SKR&src=cashtag_click) stoked wildfire speculation across the crypto world. Having waited over a year since presales for the mysterious ‘Chapter Two’ device opened, prospective Seeker owners dared to dream that Solana Mobile might kickstart yet another wave of airdrops for those seeking to disrupt the mobile duopoly.

But if Solana Mobile is actually going to reward Seeker users, there needs to be a fair and equitable way of ensuring that genuine, organic activity takes precedence.

This is where ‘Seeker Activity Tracking’ comes into play, and before the privacy maxis amongst you raise your hands in anger, take a second and think about how this might be beneficial to you.

# How to Turn On Seeker Activity Tracking

The Seed Vault Wallet app has recently implemented a critical new feature. Aptly named ‘Seeker Activity Tracking’, this new tool helps users track their participation and involvement in the Seeker ecosystem.

If you haven’t already been using Seeker every day, consider this your chance to actively manage your involvement and build rituals and routines that enhance your Seeker experience.

https://reddit.com/link/1o98dlz/video/m5z9rff3opvf1/player

To enable Seeker Activity Tracking, visit ‘Settings’ and flip ‘Usage and Diagnostics’ to the right. You should be able to access the revamped activity tab in the Seed Vault Wallet app (found in the bottom right corner of the UI.

https://preview.redd.it/4762rcv9opvf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=23ce44e1d300ad876264102008a3c229ad7fb607

Within the Activity tab, users can track the frequency and depth of their engagement across the Seeker Ecosystem. Activity tracking began in the week of September 29, so don’t worry if you didn’t receive your Seeker in the weeks immediately following shipping.

# Maximize Your Activity

Every wallet’s onchain activity is ranked across 5 levels of a tiered system. Naturally, the more you trade, stake, and interact with the Solana network, the further you advance through the 5 levels.

Seeker Activity Tracking breaks down user behaviour into three categories: Onchain, Daily Use, and dApp activity.

**Onchain Activity -** As one could expect, onchain activity covers pretty much anything that involves transacting across the Solana network. This includes, but is not limited to, trading tokens, staking [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) to a validator, minting NFTs and interacting with onchain applications.

(Maybe) Alpha Tip: While remaining a ‘passive activity’, staking [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) seems to qualify for daily participation in the Seeker Ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/3n8gf6h8opvf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=068a9bd2be199d7507893188ffbb3fda10244157

While I will openly admit I haven’t fired off transactions every single day, my own onchain activity heatmap still shows ongoing activity. This could come from supporting the Seeker Validator.

**Daily Use -** Solana Seeker’s daily activity tracker is a bit more vague. According to the Seed Vault Wallet’s UI, ‘Daily Use’ monitors how deeply the Seeker is intertwined with your standard routines.

https://preview.redd.it/uqqbkvpvjpvf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cf1429d953f7bf41765c817f0f1918b38f82eb9

Daily Use tracks how you use Seeker, and seems to be encouraging users to integrate the device into the life outside of crypto, building a streak of organic behaviour. Seeker has been designed as a mobile-first crypto device, but that doesn’t inherently mean it should only be used for crypto-related activities.

**dApps -** The Solana dApp Store now boasts over 150 unique and exclusive applications, with more being added every day. Dozens are constantly being developed through recurring hackathons, and the quality of apps on offer only improves as competition to win the favor of 150,000 authentic, verifiably high-quality Seeker users grows more fierce.

https://preview.redd.it/qv7egz17opvf1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bae9749af95940138e654fcfef91153ec8ee201

Seeker’s dApp activity tracker measures how often users are exploring the Solana dApp Store and trying out applications. The official messaging in the Seed Vault Wallet encourages users to continue experimenting with both new apps and their existing favourites, so don’t be psyoped into neglecting OG applications in favor of shiny new ones.

# SKR is Coming

It’s no secret that the most active Seeker users could find themselves on the receiving end of some kinds of rewards in the future, like a potential SKR airdrop. Points programs and other incentivized campaigns typically result in exclusive benefits for users, and participating in the Seeker ecosystem is likely to be no different.

Solana Mobile has asserted that “SKR is coming”, and “ecosystem participation is essential to making Seeker the most rewarding experience possible”.

However, Seeker users shouldn’t see this as a call to start maxxing out wash-trading accounts. The Seeker Activity Tracker clearly puts users on a more exploratory path, highlighting organic, curiosity-driven participation over mindless onchain activity.

Instead, enjoy using Seeker for its intended purpose. Contribute to building and proliferating the world’s largest decentralized mobile stack, and support and encourage creative applications within the Solana dApp Store.

>**Introducing Ultra V3 – the most advanced end to end trading engine ever created.**

It delivers what traders want most:

**- Best Price:** Meta aggregation which includes Iris, our new router  
**- Best Execution:** ShadowLane for optimal private txn landing & Predictive Execution for best-in-class execution  
**- Best Protection:** Sandwich protection & advanced slippage estimation

And it drives real results:

\- 34x better sandwich protection

\- Industry-leading performance (+0.6 bps positive slippage vs. -1bps to -14bps negative slippage from other platforms over a 7-day vol-weighted analysis)

\- 8-10x lower execution fees

Ultra v3 is seamlessly integrated across all Jupiter products, including Mobile, Web, Desktop, our API, and Pro Tools.

That’s not all – it also has enhanced Gasless Support, Ultra Signaling, JIT market revivals, and more 👇

https://reddit.com/link/1o96q09/video/c3ddt0j3cpvf1/player

>**Meta Aggregation with the New Iris Router (Exclusive to Ultra)**

Ultra uses meta aggregation between Iris, JupiterZ, DFlow, Hashflow, and OKX to find you the best pricing from various routers.

Iris, only available on Ultra, is our new router after sunsetting Metis. Iris allows better splitting (up to 0.01%) and utilizes better routing algorithms like Golden-section and Brent’s method. We are seeing 100x performance improvements with the new routing algorithms.

JupiterZ is our own RFQ system, which facilitates \~$100M daily volume with zero slippage – exclusively available via Ultra v3.

With these, you get the best price possible, every time.

>**Predictive Execution: Smart Route Prioritization For Superior Execution**

Optimized for execution and slippage – not quote-optimized illusions.

Most platforms “catfish” you with prices that don’t reflect the on-chain reality, or worse yet, mislead you into thinking they are showing the best price from Jupiter.

Predictive Execution goes beyond just simulating routes. It accurately predicts potential slippage, intelligently prioritizes routes, and ultimately gives you the best possible outcome and price at the point of execution, not just at the point of quotation.

On top of that, Predictive Execution performs just in-time simulations for every route, uses signaling to help Prop AMMs to quote tighter for non-toxic flow versus toxic flow – allowing Jupiter Ultra users to get better pricing.

With this, quotes reflect actual likely on-chain execution, not theoretical best-case scenarios. No inflated “best prices” or tricks to delude.

Predictive Execution also includes RTSE, the most advanced slippage estimator in DeFi, worked on for over 2 years.

What you see is what you get. Every swap lands exactly as promised. Executed in the best way possible, at the best price, every time.

>**Ultra Signaling: Even better pricing for Ultra Users**

Prop AMMs are a big deal recently because they can quote very tightly on-chain for users.

But they have to play defense with toxic traders like arb bots, toxic takers, etc. So, when quoting on-chain, they have to be careful to not quote too tightly (better price) to prevent being abused by these toxic traders.

Ultra Signaling is built directly on-chain on our Jupiter Aggregator contract to detect non-toxic flow on-chain. One of the Prop AMMs we are working with is now quoting 3 bps tighter (50% better) for our Ultra users with this signal.

>**ShadowLane – Elite In-House Transaction Landing Engine**

Our entirely brand new in-house transaction landing engine, ShadowLane, is built for sub-second precision and for incredible real-time data, as well as execution.

\- Private by design – no external relays, no order-flow sales.  
\- 3x more trades landed than alternative premium methods.  
\- Landing latency reduced – down from 1–3 blocks (400ms–1.2s) to 0–1 block (50–400ms).

Massive effort from our newly formed RPC team led by [@italoacasas](https://x.com/italoacasas) with contributors to Yellowstone-gRPC, NFT DAS API, Lite-RPC, Agave, and more.

There will be so much more coming from this elite team, with work that will directly benefit the broader Solana ecosystem, stay tuned!

>**Best-in-Class MEV Protection – 34x Better Than Top Trading Terminals**

Other providers increase your risk of being sandwiched by selling your order flow to third-party MEV searchers.

Ultra v3 does the opposite – it minimizes your exposure to toxic MEV by ensuring your trades are never handed off to any external provider for on-chain execution.

And while the risk isn’t zero (since validators still broadcast to the chain’s leaders), Ultra brings it as close to zero as possible.

Safe. Private. Built Differently.

>**RTSE – Real-Time Slippage Estimator**

Knowing what slippage to set is always very difficult given volatile tokens, stablecoins, big caps, and different execution scenarios.

This is a challenge not just for new DeFi users, but for experienced traders as well.

RTSE is our ongoing effort to solve this problem & uses important data points such as volume and transactions to improve outcomes. For v3 we have made a number of major changes, including:

\- Reduced RTSE slippage set while maintaining high success rates  
\- Automatic prioritization of slippage-protected routes over purely price-optimized routes  
\- Increased volatility sensitivity for tokens with high historical volatility patterns

For volatile tokens in particular, Ultra’s RTSE tightens the acceptable price range just enough to allow your swap to go through without overpaying for slippage.

>**Enhanced Gasless Support**

Gasless Support, our just-in-time fee payer, allows you to trade without needing to hold SOL for gas fees.

So long as one token has a qualifying value during a trade, Ultra will compute the gas from your transaction, and pay for it with your swap.

And now in v3 we have enhanced our Gasless Support, including expanded support (Token-2022 and memecoin-memecoin pairs), as well as lower minimum trade size (\~$10).

Now everyone with any asset in their wallet can make a trade.

>**Just-In-Time Market Revival**

Ultra v3 achieves what other legacy routers cannot. It routes every token on Solana – even the dead and forgotten ones.

\- No minimum liquidity threshold  
\- Supports old, inactive markets  
\- Dynamically re-indexes on demand

Close old positions, dump forgotten bags, trade everything.

Complete coverage of the entire Solana ecosystem – exclusively on Ultra.

>**Use Natively Across Web, Mobile & Desktop Wallet**

Jupiter has 3 world class surfaces that our users love:

\- **Web:** our full suite of Jupiter products including Portfolio, Swap, Pro, Perps, Lend, and more - giving you the most comprehensive DeFi experience and tools with best-in-class execution + protection, lowest fees, and smoothest design and UX  
\- **Jupiter Mobile:** 10x cheaper, 10x faster, 10x sexier – the best mobile trading experience (including native portfolio in a wallet and the sleekest UX), full PnL analysis, and easiest way to send and receive tokens or onboard anyone with just a link or QR  
\- **Jupiter Wallet for Desktop:** the most advanced Solana wallet as a desktop browser extension with gasless trading, deep integration with Jupiter products, PnL analysis, 10x lower fees than any other wallet - and synced with your Mobile wallet

Ultra v3 powers all these interfaces: Seamless. Consistent. Advanced.

Ultra execution, everywhere.

>**Use Seamlessly With Pro Tools & Offerings**

Built for Power Users – Ultra v3 is seamlessly integrated into every Pro tool:

\- Terminal: a command center for token metrics  
\- Screener for market discovery  
\- Portfolio + PnL for total visibility  
\- Alphascan for trending tokens + insights  
\- Analytics for data on transactions and traders

Every chart, every route, every trade – now fueled by Ultra precision.

>**Legacy Jupiter Swap**

As part of this upgrade, moving forward we will be focusing our efforts on the ongoing development and improvement of Ultra v3 with our new router, Iris. We are also rolling out the Ultra API to allow our partners to utilize the best-in-class routing/transaction landing infra behind Ultra v3.

Currently, many meta routers and many others are still using our sunsetted Jupiter Legacy API (Metis). We will be working with them to upgrade their routing to adopt the new Ultra API.

If you are using Jupiter Legacy API in your app, please correctly label to avoid misleading your users that this is the best price from Jupiter. In particular, certain apps are using the free binary, which is deprecated and we have no control over the results, and it is very discouraging to see certain platforms abuse something that we have offered to the ecosystem for free for years.

>**Ultra v3 Is Built for YOU.**

**Use easily:** Zero config or adjustments needed for the best execution.

**Use without worries:** Lowest fees possible, best protection, best-in-class transaction landing, unmatched customer service.

**Use seamlessly:** Alongside our other world-class Pro tools like Terminal, Screener, Analytics.

**Use natively:** Available on Mobile, Web, API, and Desktop.

And of course, made with love by the hardest-working team striving to perfect your experience.

>**1/** SIMD-0337 introduces block markers, paving the way for Fast Leader Handover in Alpenglow. This enables leaders to optimistically build blocks on tentative parents, minimizing delay by changing leaders. Block production starts \~120ms earlier, improving IBRL by \~7.5% 🧵

https://preview.redd.it/13vh98nr3pvf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=969317f464e5abf820f43d480219e7d68da70eaa

>**2/** Why is this hard? In many blockchain protocols, a misbehaving leader can trick the next leader into producing a block that will be abandoned. Similarly, if the next leader misbehaves, it can attempt to fork the chain and remove the previous leader's block.



>**3/** Alpenglow addresses this with state-of-the-art robustness that prevents these attacks. Correct leaders build on the correct chain, ensuring continuity and safety even when malicious actors attempt to disrupt block production.

  


>**4/** In the Alpenglow prototype, each leader waits for parent confirmation before producing the first block in its leader window. Fast Leader Handover eliminates this delay - leaders immediately begin producing blocks based on the expected parent, maximizing block production time.



>**5/** Two new markers power Fast Leader Handover: BlockHeader marks the parent at block start. UpdateParent allows leaders to switch parents mid-stream in case the previous leader was malicious. This mechanism combines the robustness of Alpenglow with maximal throughput.

🧵⬇



>**2/** Solana is a smart contract platform blockchain that stands out for the depth and diversity of its on-chain activity. Today it’s the category leader in terms of users, transaction volume, and transaction fees — arguably the three most important measures of blockchain activity.



>**3/** Smart contract blockchains are networks that host applications, and Solana is home to industry-leading applications across an impressive range of functions, including

>[u/RaydiumProtocol](https://x.com/RaydiumProtocol) (a decentralized exchange), [@pumpdotfun](https://x.com/pumpdotfun) (a consumer app), and [@helium](https://x.com/helium) (a network for mobile hotspots).



>**4/** Measuring the Solana ecosystem should take into account transaction activity on both the blockchain itself and its hosted applications. Although there’s variation over time, the Solana ecosystem earns about $425 million in fees per month¹ — or more than $5 billion annualized.

https://preview.redd.it/gk9q7rdj2pvf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=d698f4c313eef56f95b3e07fce9b13c3b3a7f62c

>**5/** Solana has managed to stand out in a competitive market by offering fast and cheap transactions, a compelling new-user experience and, in our view, partly by going its own way.



>**6/** The network produces new blocks every 400 milliseconds, and transactions can be considered final in about 12–13 seconds. In addition to high throughput, transaction costs have remained relatively low: users have paid an average transaction fee of just $0.02 year to date.

https://preview.redd.it/vccel4an2pvf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=edd8ace60ad62330c74d22c48180e570aa2b10ab

>**7/** Today there are more than 1,000 full-time developers working on Solana. This human capital could contribute to ongoing Solana-dedicated innovation over time.

>**8/** The [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) token is a digital commodity that helps operate the network and provides investment access to growth in the Solana ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/f097ytg93pvf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=21fe306995a7f01c0d0a48a379171b857e2becad

>**9/** The supply of [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) tokens currently increases at a rate of about 4%–4.5% per year². This can be considered a source of dilution for token holders, all else equal.



>**10/** However, [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) stakers can receive a nominal reward rate of around 7%³, depending on network conditions. Therefore, [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) stakers earn a “real” (inflation-adjusted) reward rate of roughly 2.5%–3%.

>**11/** Like other smart contract platform tokens, the investment thesis for the [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) token centers on potential growth in the size of the Solana network



>**12/** if the Solana network grows over time — if it hosts more users, processes more transactions, and earns more fees — investors can anticipate a rising [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) price, in our view.

solana,1o9321y,60% of Solana validators might shut down. Big SFDP changes ahead,Sujithsizon,2025-10-17T15:37:22,36,0.9,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1o9321y/60_of_solana_validators_might_shut_down_big_sfdp/,https://reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1o9321y/60_of_solana_validators_might_shut_down_big_sfdp/,"Whats Happening?  
Foundation is pivoting from long-term stake subsidies → incubator model for validators adding real ecosystem value.

Whats Changing?

1. Stake Match Reduction

* Over the next 3 months, SFDP will reduce the match ratio: From 1:1 match (cap 100k SOL) → 0.5:1 match (cap 50k SOL)
* Steps occur every 7 epochs (Epoch 865 → 893)
* Goal: encourage validators to attract external stake and self-sustain.

1. Queue Changes
2. » The time-based queue is removed.
3. » Going forward, only the Ecosystem Contributor path remains.
4. » Validators now need to actively add value to the ecosystem (tools, infrastructure, community support)
5. Why is the Foundation doing this?
6. » Focus resources on validators adding tangible network value.
7. » Reduce dependency on Foundation stake → more decentralized, self-sustaining network.
8. » Encourage new entrants to demonstrate capability & attract real delegations.

How this affects validators?

\> Validators in the time-based queue feel their years of effort and financial investments are being invalidated.  
\> Small validators (<100k SOL) often lose money: hardware + vote tx costs exceed rewards.  
\> Medium validators (100–200k SOL) near breakeven under current network

<> Many small validators may shut down, centralizing stake in larger operators.  
<> Network stability could be impacted if remaining validators cut redundancy or reduce spare nodes.

Validator Strategy Going Forward:  
» The Foundation is prioritizing value-adding participants over passive stake holders.  
» Focus on ecosystem contributions (RPC, monitoring, MEV tools, community projects).  
» Attract external delegations - rely less on SFDP stake.  
Optimize node efficiency (Alpenglow, Firedancer/Agave updates)

SFDP is now a launchpad, not a crutch. Validators who contribute, optimize, and attract stake will thrive.

solana,1o7ug0v,"During The Crash, Solana Stayed Fast And Cheap. Ethereum Got Too Expensive To Use. Here's What That Actually Means",Gullible-Tale9114,2025-10-16T03:22:05,116,0.88,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1o7ug0v/during_the_crash_solana_stayed_fast_and_cheap/,https://reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1o7ug0v/during_the_crash_solana_stayed_fast_and_cheap/,"When that $19 billion liquidation event hit last Friday, it basically turned into a real world stress test for every major blockchain. And it revealed something big about how Solana and Ethereum behave under pressure.

Solana held up. Ethereum didn’t.

Let’s look at the actual performance data.

During peak chaos, Solana was processing around 1,200 to 1,300 transactions per second (TPS). Block finality stayed near 400 to 450 milliseconds, and while fees spiked briefly, they only went up to $0.20 to $0.30 per transaction before dropping back below a cent. The network stayed stable with no major slowdowns or congestion.

Ethereum, on the other hand, was limited to roughly 13 to 15 TPS on the base layer (not 26). Block times extended to 14 to 15 seconds, and gas fees jumped above $500 per transaction at peak congestion, according to Etherscan data. That made the network effectively unusable for most people, transactions stalled, and many wallets and DeFi positions couldn’t execute because users were priced out.

As one treasury firm, DefDevCorp, put it: “If your gas fees make the network inaccessible, it’s the same as being offline.” In contrast, Solana stayed operational throughout, proving the recent upgrades to Firedancer, QUIC, and stake weighted QoS have strengthened network performance.

Crypto researcher Aylo shared that during the crash, he could rebalance and move funds on Solana easily, while his Ethereum positions were frozen due to extreme gas costs. That’s a real world example of how Solana’s architecture built for high throughput performs differently from Ethereum’s more conservative, security focused base layer.

Ethereum’s scaling solutions (like Arbitrum and Base) help under normal conditions, but the mainnet still bottlenecks during global panic moments. And that’s when Solana shines, not because it’s perfect, but because it was designed for speed from the ground up.

This is more than just a one day win. Solana’s had over 20 months of uptime since early 2023, a major improvement after its earlier reliability issues. Ethereum’s ecosystem is still much larger and more decentralized, but in raw throughput and stability under stress, Solana’s catching serious attention.

If these patterns continue, where Solana stays usable during chaos and Ethereum slows down, that could shift how institutions and DeFi protocols allocate capital. Traders and developers want reliability when the market’s melting down, not just during quiet times.

And that’s exactly the mindset driving projects like Awaken, which are building directly on Solana to take advantage of its real-world performance edge. Because in moments when speed, cost, and uptime decide everything, being on the right foundation matters.

Both chains have their strengths: Ethereum’s decentralization and history versus Solana’s speed and cost efficiency. But this crash proved one thing clearly, when crypto’s under pressure, Solana’s network holds up better in real world performance tests.",Ecosystem,True,,False

traditional finance no longer wants exposure they want yield.

A lot of people have asked how Unclaimed SOL compares to Sol Incinerator or Claim Your SOL, so instead of just explaining it from our side, I wanted to actually test all three tools and share transparent results in the community.

Here’s what I noticed while trying them out:

* **Sol Incinerator:** Huge respect - it’s one of the first and still works reliably. The only thing I’d change is fee visibility and polish a design a little bit; users don’t see exact costs before claiming, which can make tracking hard.
* **Claim Your SOL:** Works fine but the fee was big **20%**, which felt high compared to others. The UI is clean but limited if you’ve got a lot of accounts to close.
* **Unclaimed SOL:** (ours) Returned the most SOL on average and scans for the most opportunities. Fee is exactly **5%**.

The goal here isn’t to bash anyone - all three tools serve the same purpose and help keep Solana wallets clean.  
I just wanted to provide data so users can make an informed choice.

Here’s the full write-up with tables and fee comparisons if you want the full context:

# 🔎 Audit Subsidy Program

Areta is launching a new $1M Solana Audit Subsidy program to help Solana developers secure their projects by making professional audits more accessible to teams of all sizes.

The subsidy pool is sponsored by leading audit firms active within the Solana space and an independent board composed of ecosystem leaders will review applications to make sure funds are directed toward the most promising builders.

Applications to the program are open year-round and operate on a monthly cohort basis. Submissions close on the 7th of each month, with feedback provided by the 14th. 

Teams accepted into the Colosseum Accelerator program will be fast-tracked for approval within the program, helping them access audit funding and reviews more efficiently. 

The Audit Subsidy Program is a community-driven effort to provide affordable, high-quality security audits to Solana builders.

# 🏫 LearnSol Educational Content

LearnSol has launched as a free, open-source curriculum designed to help developers learn Solana development by providing step-by-step guidance, practice tools, and project-based learning.

Features include guided tutorials covering Solana, Rust, Anchor, and client-side development, an AI chat that explains concepts, and gamified learning through interactive challenges. 

Developers can build and deploy real applications such as token mints, NFT marketplaces, and escrow contracts with a single click, while challenges like “30 Days of Rust” encourage consistent learning.

This early release is part of a work-in-progress, with additional educational content and modules planned as the curriculum expands.

# 🚀 Umbra ICO

Privacy project Umbra, who received an Honorable Mention in the Colosseum Breakout Hackathon, launched its initial coin offering (ICO) on Solana this week, raising $154.9 million, more than 20,000% of its $750,000 minimum target. The team refunded the majority of those raised funds up to the cap of $3M.

The key to this launch was the infrastructure that powered it, an “Unruggable ICO” futarchy launchpad powered by MetaDAO, a Colosseum portco, which uses markets rather than token-based voting to guide decisions, as well as provide ownership rights to token investors.

The sale marks one of the first large-scale tests of futarchy applied to crypto fundraising, signaling growing interest in market-driven coordination models on Solana.

# 👷‍♀️ Cyfrin Jobs Board

Cyfrin just launched Cyfrin Jobs, a blockchain-native job board built to connect  top onchain organizations with vetted developers.

Cyfrin Jobs highlights your real onchain experience by automatically building your profile from verified activity across the Cyfrin ecosystem. It pulls in Updraft certifications, CodeHawks competition results, and Solodit security findings to showcase your skills, achievements, and hands-on project work

For teams, the platform filters out noise with verified candidates, AI-assisted matching, and integration with recruiting tools.

Some early partners hiring through the platform include Solana, Helius,  Uniswap, and Monad and RedStone. 

Developers get a dynamic profile that updates as they earn certifications or complete competitions, plus access to a Telegram channel highlighting new roles.

# 🎵 Open Audio Protocol

Audius has launched v1.0 of the Open Audio Protocol, a major step toward decentralizing the music industry. The update introduces Artist Coins, a new Solana-based system that lets artists and fans directly participate in the value they create.

Built in partnership with Solana, Meteora, Jupiter, and Metaplex, Artist Coins form the foundation of the Open Audio Protocol. Each coin launches on a bonding curve paired with $AUDIO, with trading fees flowing back into a community treasury. 

Artists can drop coins to fans, run campaigns, and launch bounties or activations, while fans gain a way to support and invest in creators they believe in.

The 1.0 release also rebrands the Audius protocol itself as the Open Audio Protocol, reflecting its evolution from a single music app to a full, open infrastructure layer for global music distribution. 

Audius has now powered nearly 400 million music streams across apps built on its catalog. With this launch, it aims to redefine how artists control their distribution and how fans engage with the music economy

# 🔬 DeSci News

DeSciNews has launched as a hub for all things Decentralized Science (DeSci), bringing together the latest news, research, tools, and projects, and how scientists can raise capital, collaborate, and publish openly.

Projects like VitaDAO, ValleyDAO, and AthenaDAO are already funding real-world labs and experiments, while Molecule is creating liquid Science IP tokens to make research ownership transparent and tradable. Other initiatives are redefining participation and privacy in scientific research. 

DeSciNews positions itself as the go-to resource for anyone following this evolving field, covering the people, protocols, and platforms driving the next wave of DeSci projects.

# 🎧 Listen to This

**Solana Weekly**

This week’s episode features Gaius, CEO of The Vault and founder of The Library, one of Solana’s longest-running builder communities, who shares his path from traditional finance into crypto, why he focuses on infrastructure instead of speculation, and how builders can sustain progress through volatile markets.

Much of the conversation focused on developer culture as Solana’s competitive advantage. The people who build on nights and weekends for the sake of creation, he said, can’t be outworked. The challenge now is maintaining that motivation as early builders find success.

The discussion traces the evolution of Solana’s community, from speculative hype to sustainable development, and what it takes to endure market cycles without losing focus.

I have had placed a pre order for Solana Seeker mobile when it was announced. I didn’t think twice because I was calculating that even if the phone is shit, it could pay itself off with the airdrops. 
Now I’ve been waiting ever since the shipping has started and till now, my order is still in ‘Awaiting shipment’ status. 
So I’ve been wondering whether there is anyone else who is in the same situation as I am. I am from India so I can somewhat understand if the shipment is delayed by a couple of weeks or even months but this is nuts! There is literally no response from the team except for ‘have patience’. No solid updates. No one takes responsibility.
What’s even worse is that - they are announcing airdrops for people who already got the phone! WTH! What about the people who’ve pre ordered it and is ‘awaiting shipment’?!
Funny enough - there is no refund too so I feel like I got totally scammed out of my money.

solana,1o3qi4t,Are you protecting your trades from the newly evolved Evasive Sandwiching?,Sujithsizon,2025-10-11T09:41:53,6,0.88,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1o3qi4t/are_you_protecting_your_trades_from_the_newly/,https://reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1o3qi4t/are_you_protecting_your_trades_from_the_newly/,"Sandwich attacks are simple in theory:

\- Attacker front-runs your buy → pushes price up  
\- You trade at worse price  
\- Attacker back-runs with a sell → extracts profit

Enter Evasive Sandwiching:

Instead of one clean front-run + one clean back-run, they now use obfuscation techniques:

\- Split their back-run into fragments  
\- Route through multiple pools  
\- Hide identity across wallets

This breaks naive “symmetry” detection, making them much harder to catch

Understanding Obfuscation via Transfers

1. Attacker front-runs with Wallet A.
2. Before back-running, sends tokens to Wallet B. Wallet B sells.
3. Split Back-run: - Instead of dumping 100 SOL back in one pool, attacker splits:

50 SOL on Orca  
30 SOL on Raydium  
20 SOL on Phoenix

To a simple detector, these look like 2 unrelated wallets trading near a victim, not part of one coordinated sandwich

Astralane’s MEV-Protect:

It actively prevents attacks by routing your transactions through our low-latency sender, Iris, with built-in protection against classic sandwiches and malicious validator routing  
\- When enabled, we actively check the current Solana leader against our custom list of flagged validators (threshold can be custom)  
\- If the current leader is deemed unsafe, we hold the transaction and defer sending until a trusted leader takes over.

I’m currently doing some market research for a project idea combining **IoT (Internet of Things)** and **Blockchain (specifically Solana)** and I’d love to get some input from the community here.

A lot of us in this space tend to be *either* strong in blockchain/web3 *or* in IoT/hardware but rarely both. So I’m curious to understand what kind of **real-world use cases or services** people would actually find *useful* (or even be excited to build).

For example:

* What kind of IoT devices or data would you like to see connected to the blockchain?
* If you could build any IoT-powered dApp, what would it do?
* Are there any pain points in IoT (or blockchain) you think blockchain could realistically solve?
* Or any IoT services that could benefit from token incentives, decentralization, or transparency?

Would really appreciate any thoughts, even quick ones  
We’re trying to identify what *actually makes sense* not just something “cool with buzzwords.”

Thanks in advance, and I’ll share insights later if anyone’s interested in the results!

They're teaming up with Figment, the top independent staking provider handling $18B in assets across 40+ protocols. Figment brings battle-tested infrastructure (they were genesis validators for both ETH and SOL) plus top-notch security, compliance, and slashing protection.   
Figment's CEO Lorien Gabel put it: “Beyond returns, staking in ETPs enables holders to participate in securing and processing transactions for the blockchain.” This could supercharge ETH and SOL flows into tradfi.

Solana is truly unique in the blockchain world. I've never seen a network quite like it. It has been plagued by incidents and accidents—multiple periods of downtime remain a significant investment risk, and unexpected events like the FTX collapse and the broader crypto winter have tested it repeatedly. Yet, Solana has miraculously revived, its ecosystem has persisted, and developers haven't abandoned it.

Projects like **Backpack**, **Helius**, and **Jupiter** are, in my opinion, essentially NFTs in their very essence. I believe xNFTs will be used in incredibly diverse ways in the near future. With the recent launch of Sora2, I have a very strong feeling that sophisticated textures created by artists using these tools will be xNFT-ified. Solana already possesses peerless developers and the infrastructure to transform content into cultural value, and I see this as a huge differentiator.

It's natural for a robust society to have sites associated with speculation and gambling, just as a huge country like the US has Las Vegas. This space is, after all, a society where people congregate.

Blockchain, in my view, is set to become a fundamental piece of everyday infrastructure, not just a tool for RWA or asset tokenization. Four years from now, the situation could be drastically different from today.



# Institutional Adoption and ETF Dynamics



It's true that the introduction of an **ETF** would be highly favorable for Solana. The number of DA (Digital Asset) companies is slowly growing. Whereas Solana was previously bought and sold mostly by individuals, institutions and various corporations will now be buying it, which, theoretically, should positively impact the price. Moreover, being listed on a major exchange like Nasdaq signifies that Solana has been internationally recognized as a legitimate asset.

However, what happens if the Solana network experiences another downtime or a major security issue? We don't need to compete with Ethereum; Solana must compete with itself. I don't feel the need to get into the ambiguous wordplay of whether Solana is a Layer 1 or a Layer 2. What's clear is that beyond simple transfers of money, Layer 2s aren't being used for much else. I also never want to experience the frustration of exorbitant gas fees and the sluggishness of the Ethereum network again. There were people who waited two months just to unstake their assets.



# The Path to a More Robust Solana



Solana is currently undergoing a complete overhaul of its legacy Proof-of-History (PoH) mechanism. The plan, which is currently being tested and executed, is to off-chain all accumulated data from the consensus process, separate the heavy data transfer network, and optimize simplicity by dividing the roles of block builders and proposers.

Furthermore, an independent client, **Firedancer**, is slowly reaching completion, alongside existing clients like Agave and Jito-Solana. Having an additional independent client is a crucial undertaking that will significantly boost network security. I believe that once the trinity of **AlpenGlow, Firedancer, and the BAM project** is a stable full-stack reality, Solana will earn true respect.

This meticulous, step-by-step progress—making Solana safer, gaining external recognition, and fostering better user experience—may be even more critical than an ETF. An ETF doesn't guarantee a positive outcome. Nasdaq is an arena of fierce competition where even a minor slip can lead to total disappearance. We must remember that even Ethereum's ETF launch last year coincided with a price drop. We also can't forget that institutions are the first to execute arbitrage on futures exchanges. The fact that the futures market is currently 12-20 times larger than the spot market is also a burden for long-term holders.

While the SEC's fast-track process has been established, the current government shutdown adds uncertainty to the Solana ETF timeline. Nevertheless, considering its listing on futures exchanges for over six months, I cautiously predict that a listing is likely, even if the timing is delayed.

I acknowledge the current headwinds, such as inflation and the FTX unlock sales, but I believe the market is absorbing them more quickly than expected. There is also ongoing debate about Solana's centralization, so why is its **Nakamoto Coefficient** so high? Perhaps we are all simply missing the invisible pieces of the puzzle. That may include me as well. But I believe in Solana, and I believe in all the constituents of the Solana ecosystem.

There's an old saying: ""Buy what you know."" I believe the future Solana will be far more robust than it is today. I've been buying Solana within my means, even with the recent price surges. I'm a small, individual investor, but I plan to continue buying whenever the price dips.



# P.S. Regarding Solana ETPs



**P.S.** On a related note, the Assets Under Management (AUM) for the two European Solana ETPs—the **21Shares Solana Staking ETP (ASOL, SIX)** and the **CoinShares Physical Staked Solana (SLNC, Xetra/Swiss)**—are quite substantial.

||
||
|ETP Ticker (Exchange)|Issuer|Approximate AUM (USD/EUR)|Feature|
|**ASOL (SIX)**|21Shares|≈$1.34≈€1.39 Billion (or   Billion)|**Staking Yields**Physically-backed,  |
|**SLNC (Xetra/SIX)**|CoinShares|≈$633≈€539 Million (or   Million)|**Staking Rewards (0% Fee)**Physically-backed,  |

Could this high AUM be due to the inclusion of **staking** rewards? That seems like a very good benchmark for what institutional investors value.",Ecosystem,True,,False

They revealed the new AgentKit Agent Builder with the goal of improving the automation of workflows. It got me thinking about the trajectory DeFi is growing at. I believe the future is clear, especially after today:

DeFi's Scaling **Fast**. Humans **Can't Keep Up**.

Let's break it down.

Solana DeFi just hit $13 billion in TVL for the first time. Six protocols crossed the billion-dollar mark (SolanaFloor) – Jito at $2B, Kamino at $1.61B doing lending. Jupiter processed over a trillion dollars in lifetime volume and captures 90%+ of aggregator activity (@21shares\_us). The infrastructure is actually working.

But here's the reality: only 5-10% of crypto users are actively using their holdings (@rimeissner - Safe co-founder). 62% of crypto users now juggle at least two different wallets, up from 46% a year ago. You see the protocol alerts, you read about liquidations when people can't track exposure across platforms.

Millions of dollars get lost to liquidations every day in DeFi - not because people are reckless, but because liquidation risk is somewhat invisible (@jrdothoughts) when you're managing positions across multiple protocols. Your SOL staked with your favorite validator, USDC earning yield on Kamino, perps open on Drift, liquidity in Meteora, swaps routing through Jupiter - you know each position individually. Your total exposure? Your aggregate liquidation threshold across everything? Mental math across several interfaces.

I am working on something. It's an intelligent command center. One place where you see all your positions across Jupiter, Drift, Kamino, Meteora, Orca, Raydium, DFlow - everything. You get analytics on the full picture: lending, borrowing, your vaults, strategies, every spot and perps position. Your agents do the heavy lifting. They monitor risk profiles around the clock, surface opportunities, execute when conditions hit. You stay in control. Automate what you trust, approve what you don't. Ask for a summary of your exposure, get insights on where your capital's working hardest, automate rebalancing when allocations drift. An all-encompassing perspective with intelligent, agent-driven action.

Visibility doesn't solve it. You need monitoring, alerts, insights, and execution—across everything. A system that knows when you're about to get liquidated, spots better yield opportunities before you do, flags portfolio drift, surfaces arbitrage, and acts when your conditions hit. Not another dashboard showing static positions, but active intelligence working 24/7. When 50% of DeFi liquidity is fragmented across chains and you're managing positions across multiple protocols, you need something that understands your full strategy, watches every protocol, catches every opportunity, and executes on your behalf. Manual monitoring doesn't scale when markets move this fast.

Solana TVL doubled in a year. Jupiter processes $700M+ in daily swaps. The activity is compounding. The way I see it, an automated assustant is the ony way you can actually harness it - see everything, understand everything, act on everything - without drowning in interfaces or missing the move because you were checking a different protocol.

DeFi's scaling fast. Humans can't manually track positions across protocols, spot every risk, and execute fast enough. It's clear that the future of DeFI is going to look significantly different than it does today. The question is, what do you think that looks like?

most client needs softwares because they use huge funds and never trust hosted services. but for last 6 months , i am struggling to get even  a single client. i even made my repo public so people can use it . zero users . whenever i shill too much , sometimes client will come but they wont pay . they just ask stuffs and they just go away. 

recently i build a dapp on solana too that the buyer can actually make huge money . i tried selling the platform too. some enquiries came but nobody bought.

At current prices around $232 to $235, the company’s SOL holdings are worth approximately $525 million. Combined with its cash reserves, the total value of its assets now exceeds $530 million, surpassing the gross proceeds raised during its private placement in September.

Cosmo Jiang from Pantera Capital, who serves as a board observer, compared their approach to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy at MicroStrategy and Tom Lee’s model at Bitmine. Jiang stated that the company is “efficiently accumulating SOL to maximize shareholder value.”

CEO Joseph Chee added that institutional demand for Solana exposure has been stronger than expected, particularly after recent digital asset conferences in Asia. This indicates growing institutional interest in Solana as a treasury asset, not just from retail investors.

Solana Company becomes one of the first publicly traded firms to hold SOL as a primary balance sheet asset, similar to how MicroStrategy uses Bitcoin and Bitmine uses Ethereum. When public companies hold crypto on their balance sheet, it creates consistent demand that is less tied to short term retail sentiment.

2.2 million SOL represents a substantial portion of circulating supply being locked by a single entity, reducing available liquidity in the market. If more public companies follow this model, it could create steady buying pressure similar to Bitcoin’s corporate treasury wave.

Whether Solana Company’s stock trades at a premium like MicroStrategy’s remains to be seen, but this move marks an important moment for corporate adoption of Solana as a treasury asset.",Ecosystem,True,,False

It’s currently one of the top cryptocurrencies, usually appearing right after Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of market capitalization and hype.

I’d like to understand why it has gained such a high ranking. Is it primarily due to its technological advantages, like high transaction speed and scalability? Or is it more about developer adoption, ecosystem growth, or investor interest?

Solana is known for its Proof-of-History + Proof-of-Stake consensus, which allows it to process thousands of transactions per second with very low fees. But beyond these technical details, what are the real-world factors that have propelled it to such a prominent position?

Especially when Solana is not as decentralized as ETH or BTC. There are very few validators on the solana chain as compared to ETH.

I’d love to hear insights from people who follow the crypto market closely. What do you think makes Solana stand out compared to other blockchain projects? Are there risks or challenges that might affect its future ranking?

Note : Please be polite in the thread and avoid heavy jargon. Treat this thread as a way to help and bring awareness to beginners looking to invest in SOL but who do not have enough knowledge. I used AI to clean up and fix grammar since English is not my first language. ",Ecosystem,True,,False

# 📃 Hackathon RFPs

Colosseum has outlined project ideas it would like to see explored in the upcoming [Cypherpunk Hackathon](https://www.colosseum.com/cypherpunk?ref=blog.colosseum.com).

**Highlighted suggestions include:**

* **P2P payments for bordering countries** focused on specific payment corridors or niche communities.
* **Groupchat trading tools** that allow pooled capital and collective trading on platforms like Telegram.
* **Onchain transparency ratings** to differentiate legitimate projects from scams using zkTLS or crowdsourced analysis.
* **Permissionless prediction markets** where anyone can create and trade predictions without centralized oversight.

These ideas are meant as inspiration and do not guarantee prizes, funding, or entry into Colosseum’s accelerator program.

Colosseum has published additional areas of interest beyond those listed here, and developers are encouraged to review the full post for more suggestions and details.

# 🔮Prediction Markets

A new guide on prediction markets maps out how these products work and the trade-offs builders face. 

The TLDR is simple: prediction markets are no longer niche, with more than 450 projects now tracked and volumes hitting record highs. 

At their core, every forecasting product must answer two questions: how to price beliefs today and who decides the truth tomorrow.

The guide covers the mechanics of prediction markets, the design choices available, and real-world examples. 

It is organized around three main axes:

1. **Resolution:** Who determines outcomes, from optimistic oracles to human editors, courts, rulebooks, or automated feeds.
2. **Market design**: How prices form, whether through AMMs, pools, orderbooks, or scoring-rule tournaments.
3. **Infrastructure**: Where the system runs, including on-chain setups, hybrid regulated venues, or off-chain tournaments.

This research provides a practical framework for evaluating trade-offs and design models. 

Builders in this emerging space are advised to choose resolution methods they trust, pricing engines their liquidity can support, and infrastructure that will not fail at settlement time.

[**The Technical Typology of Prediction/Forecasting Projects**](https://medium.com/@smilewithkhushi/the-technical-typology-of-prediction-forecasting-projects-6aa497e2c7d9?ref=blog.colosseum.com)

# 🔄 Asynchronous Market Queues (AMQs)

Asynchronous Market Queues (AMQs) introduce a new way for Solana applications to control how trades are executed. Instead of strict first-come-first-serve ordering, AMQs let apps batch transactions and decide their own execution rules. 

This model, called Application Controlled Execution (ACE), can give market makers more flexibility, reduce losses from sudden price jumps, and enable tighter spreads and better liquidity.

AMQs divide program instructions into two types.

1. **Synchronous instructions** (such as deposits or withdrawals) that execute immediately.
2. **Asynchronous instructions** (such as cancels or limit orders) that are added to a priority queue.

Each instruction is tagged with its slot and sequence number, then sorted according to application-defined rules. The queue is later processed after a short delay or when full, ensuring execution happens in priority order rather than simply by arrival time.

Solana is uniquely positioned to support AMQs because programs can already queue and sort asynchronous instructions without requiring any protocol changes. 

This allows builders to experiment with new market models that would not be possible in traditional finance or on most other blockchains.

For DeFi builders, AMQs open the door to policy-aware sequencing, application-specific auctions, and more innovative execution mechanisms.

# 🤑 dApp Revenue Dominance

Solana’s dApp ecosystem continues to show strong revenue momentum with record highs and steady growth across categories. 

August numbers show both record highs and steady growth across categories.

Key highlights include:

* **DePIN projects** posted an all-time high of $1.6M in revenue, up 60% month-over-month, led by Helium, GEODNET, UpRock, and Hivemapper.
* **DeFiTuna** reached $422K, distributing 100% of revenue to stakers.
* **Hylo** set a new record with $238K in revenue, driven by its dual-token model and adaptive mint/redeem fees.
* **Squads Protocol** marked its eighth consecutive month of growth, reaching $35K from rising business subscriptions and multisig activity.
* **Helium** now routes subscription and usage revenue directly to onchain burns, boosting DePIN revenue sustainability.

These results highlight the depth and diversification of revenue across Solana’s ecosystem. Check out the full report for a complete breakdown.

**Here's what's featured in this week's issue:**

* Ackee has open-sourced their School of Solana Handbook
* Zeus Network launches BitcoinKit for BTC powered DeFi apps on Solana
* DFlow launches JIT Router to optimize trades during transaction execution
* Phantom Announces Phantom Cash and CASH Stablecoin for consumer payments
* Wallet UI v2 ships a new, modular approach

# 👩‍🏫 Solana Handbook

Ackee has open-sourced their School of Solana Handbook, written by active auditors, with actionable knowledge for builders.

Modules cover fundamentals to advanced program architecture:

* **Solana Basics**: Learn the foundations of the blockchain
* **Core Concepts**: The eight unique features that make Solana fast
* **Programming Model**: How to build with Solana’s parallel runtime
* **Solana Program Library**: Ready-made programs for tokens, accounts, and more

This is the same battle-tested curriculum used in the School of Solana program and  auditor training, now free for all builders

[**Solana Handbook**](https://ackee.xyz/solana/book/latest/?ref=blog.colosseum.com)

# 🪙 BitcoinKit

Zeus Network has introduced BitcoinKit, an open-source infrastructure toolkit that transforms Bitcoin into programmable money on Solana. The goal is to give developers direct, permissionless access to Bitcoin’s $2T liquidity without relying on custodians, wrapped tokens, or fragmented L2 solutions.

BitcoinKit leverages ZeusLayer to verify and tokenize BTC deposits in real time, creating zBTC, a token backed 1:1 by native Bitcoin. 

Once issued, zBTC can flow seamlessly into Solana DeFi protocols, where it behaves like any other onchain asset while retaining Bitcoin’s underlying security guarantees.

BitcoinKit is designed with a developer-first approach, offering multiple integration paths including widgets, agents, CLI tools, APIs, and full SDKs. 

BitcoinKit debuts inside Jupnet (Jupiter’s Omnichain Liquidity Network), enabling users to deposit and withdraw native BTC directly into Solana. 

This gives developers the ability to build Bitcoin-backed lending markets, BTC-stablecoin swaps,or  yield products, all powered by Solana’s high-throughput runtime.

[**BitcoinKit: The Open Infrastructure Kit Unlocking Bitcoin's Programmable Economy**](https://zeusnetwork.xyz/blog/BitcoinKit-Unlocking-Bitcoin-Programmable-Economy?ref=blog.colosseum.com)

# 🛣️ DFlow JIT Router

DFlow has relaunched with a rebuilt aggregator, new interface, and a new Just in Time routing engine that can optimize a swap during transaction execution, not only before it.

Traditional aggregators calculate routes offchain, locking them in before a transaction is executed, often leading to failed swaps or heavy slippage.

DFlow’s JIT Router solves this by checking market prices at the moment of execution. 

If conditions have shifted, it automatically reroutes to the best venue all within the same transaction.

Swap instructions can branch dynamically, letting the router select the optimal liquidity source in real time so traders capture the best price on swaps. 

Developers can leverage JIT Routing to offer users the best swaps in their own apps, focusing on product innovation while DFlow ensures trades settle efficiently under the hood.

[**The DFlow JIT Router: Bringing Routing Intelligence Onchain**](https://x.com/DFlowProtocol/status/1971308248910204942?ref=blog.colosseum.com)

# 💳 Phantom Cash

Phantom has launched Phantom Cash, a new consumer payments platform that expands its Solana wallet into a full money app. 

Powered by $CASH, a USD-pegged stablecoin issued via Bridge (Stripe’s Open Issuance infrastructure), Phantom Cash lets users add money via bank or card directly in-app, buy/sell stablecoins with no fees, and spend anywhere Visa is accepted through Apple Pay, Google Pay, or a Phantom debit card.

Launching exclusively on Solana (initially), Phantom Cash signals the wallet’s shift from a crypto-first product to a mainstream consumer payments app, giving its 15M monthly users an easy way to spend, send, and save with stablecoins.

Builders can integrate CASH into DeFi protocols, payments apps, and consumer products and a path to connect payments and stablecoin DeFi in one ecosystem.

[**Introducing Phantom Cash: New Money, Now in Your Wallet**](https://www.phantom.com/learn/blog/introducing-phantom-cash?ref=blog.colosseum.com)

# 👛 Wallet UI v2

Wallet UI v2 is a major update that makes the developer toolkit leaner, and more reliable. 

The release includes:

* Comprehensive new docs with examples
* Fixes for functional and logical errors that broke apps or caused odd behavior
* Separation of Gill SDK into its own package, allowing cleaner composition with any client
* Improved stability and flexibility

This modular shift means devs can now plug Wallet UI into different backends, creating a clean upgrade path to modern SDKs.

Something like a **solana program “vault”** (or smart contract) that lets you deposit crypto and *forces* you to hold it for a fixed time — 1, 5, 10 years or more.

* The funds are **locked by the contract**, no one (including devs) can withdraw early.  
* During the lock, the contract could **auto-stake** the SOL so it still earns yield.  
* At maturity, it automatically sends everything (principal + yield) back to your wallet.

It basically emulates what happened to KD, that you’re forced to HODL.

I think this could be a fun project built for people who want to make a long term commitment but may not have the will power to do so (like myself).

Curious if people would actually use something like this. Would the trust model of a smart contract be enough, or would people still worry? Are there already something that does this?

solana,1nyllvk,"Why is Solana's inflation rate actually close to 16% yoy? - Solana’s “Official” Inflation vs. the Real, Lived Inflation",Topical595,2025-10-05T12:20:54,15,0.76,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1nyllvk/why_is_solanas_inflation_rate_actually_close_to/,https://reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1nyllvk/why_is_solanas_inflation_rate_actually_close_to/,"Article from [cryptoinflation.eu](http://cryptoinflation.eu) :  
  
Most dashboards show a single “inflation rate” for Solana. That number isn’t *wrong*—it just describes **policy minting**, not the **growth of tradable (circulating) supply** that markets actually feel. In this article, we will take a look at theese two sides of the same coin and explain the differences.

# 1) What the official inflation rate is

Solana’s protocol sets an **annual inflation parameter** and mints new SOL proportionally over time, distributing it to the staked set (validators + delegators). Conceptually:

* `r_annual` — protocol’s annual inflation parameter (decimal, e.g., 0.07 for 7%)
* `S_start` — total SOL supply at the start of a period
* `Δt` — length of the epoch (seconds)
* `Y` — seconds per year (e.g., 31,536,000)

**Exact time-proportional mint for one epoch**

    Mint_epoch = S_start * ( (1 + r_annual)^(Δt / Y) - 1 )

Annualizing across many epochs reproduces the **official** or **policy inflation**. That figure answers:

>

**Important:** This is about **minted supply** by design. It does **not** attempt to measure the market float.

[Solana’s official inflation rate. Source: https:\/\/docs.anza.xyz\/implemented-proposals\/ed\_overview\/ed\_validation\_client\_economics\/ed\_vce\_state\_validation\_protocol\_based\_rewards](https://preview.redd.it/j1g1pdz41atf1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=018509bfb121f9aa195bcd0597df9bb9a27c9dff)

# 2) Why “policy minting” ≠ “what the market feels”

Two parallel ideas often get conflated:

* **Monetary (total) supply inflation** — how much the **total** supply changes after accounting for burns and other adjustments.
* **Circulating (float) inflation** — how much the **tradable/circulating** supply changes, which also depends on unlocks and treasury movements.

The official number targets minting; **net supply** and **circulating** each add their own layers.

# 3) Circulating (float) inflation (market view)

Many readers care about the growth of **circulating** supply—the coins that can trade. Unlocks and treasury moves matter here.

Let:

* `Circ_T0`, `Circ_T1` — circulating supply at start/end
* `Unlocks` — previously non-circulating SOL that entered circulation
* `Relocks` — SOL that left circulation (vesting/escrow/treasury moves)
* `Treasury_Moves` — any policy-relevant reclassifications affecting float (foundation spending, grants, etc.)

Observed change:

    ΔCirc_observed = Circ_T1 - Circ_T0

You can decompose it (optional, for clarity):

    ΔCirc_observed = (Real_Issuance - Burns_effect_on_circulating) + Unlocks - Relocks + Treasury_Moves

Then the float inflation rate:

    CircInfl_window = ΔCirc_observed / Circ_T0
    CircInfl_annualized = (1 + CircInfl_window)^( Seconds_per_year / Seconds_in_window ) - 1

**Key distinction:** Unlocks and treasury distributions **do not mint** new SOL; they change **who can sell it**, so they affect **circulating**, not **total** supply.

[Market inflation rate from https:\/\/www.cryptoinflation.eu\/coin\/solana](https://preview.redd.it/wqjclvyk1atf1.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=359dd24cbe18fcb583f1f71f5aa7eadad070e333)

# 4) Reconciling the perspectives

* **Official (policy) inflation**: what the protocol intends to mint per year.
* **Circulating inflation**: how the tradable float changed after unlocks/treasury activity and burns.

# Bottom line

The **official Solana inflation rate isn’t wrong**—it’s just a **policy measure of minting**. Markets often care more about **net supply** (after burns) and **circulating float** (after unlocks/treasury moves).",Dev/Tech,True,,False

The idea is to:
	•	Stream wallet transactions in real time (RPC/WebSocket or other approaches)
	•	Tag / cluster wallets by repeated behavior (deployers, active traders, whales, etc.)
	•	Store this data cleanly so I can later backtest and build filters for patterns
	•	Eventually connect this into MEV research — but with a focus on protective / ethical strategies (e.g., avoiding harmful sandwiching, exploring fair-ordering concepts, and looking at how validators/searchers handle flow on Solana).

A couple of questions I’m running into:
	1.	For low latency streaming, are people here leaning on Solana Web3.js, Rust SDK, or direct RPC subscriptions?
	2.	How do you handle missed events if a websocket connection drops?
	3.	Any tips on efficiently labeling wallets without ballooning storage/compute?
	4.	For those who’ve explored MEV in Solana — are there recommended frameworks or repos for researching it ethically (not exploit code, just analysis)?

# A New Foundation for Web3 Gaming

What began as a community-led project with no external funding has grown into a live platform powering consoles, games, and wallets, across the Solana ecosystem. Today, Play Solana is unveiling its boldest step forward: a unified distribution engine for Web3 gaming.The Play Solana SuperHUB is a vertically integrated ecosystem that unites hardware, games, identity, DeFi, and cultural IP into one seamless foundation. Built to address the structural flaws of Web3 gaming, SuperHUB is designed to onboard millions of players through a premium, intuitive experience.

# Why Web3 Gaming Hasn’t Broken Out

Despite years of progress and billions in funding, Web3 gaming has yet to achieve mainstream traction. User numbers remain small, retention is weak, and cultural impact has been limited compared to traditional platforms.

The data underscores the gap:

* In May 2025, Web3 gaming recorded 4.9 million daily active wallets. This figure represents wallet activity, not unique players, and it accounts for less than 0.6% of the 820 million active crypto wallets globally.
* By comparison, Roblox reports over 112 million daily active users, while Steam has more than 69 million. Even when measured against individual platforms, the entire Web3 gaming ecosystem still lags significantly in both scale and retention.

[Steam and Roblox DAU figures reflect unique users, while Web3 gaming DAU refers to unique wallet interactions and may not represent individual players. Web3 data includes all wallet activity across blockchain gaming dApps. Sources: Steam \(\~69M DAU\) from Backlinko & DemandSage; Roblox \(\~112M DAU\) from DemandSage; Web3 gaming \(\~4.9M daily unique active wallets in May 2025\) from DappRadar.](https://preview.redd.it/anxs4954eysf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=5227767fa951e97b8376b8fbbe39859803ff2d8a)

>  
This disparity is not just about scale; it reflects deeper structural flaws:

1. No onboarding funnel: Most games assume players arrive with a wallet and blockchain knowledge. There is no accessible entry point that attracts users through story, gameplay, or curiosity.
2. Lack of fun-first design: Many titles adopted Play-to-Earn models that prioritized speculation over gameplay. Yield mechanics and NFT flipping replaced creativity, and retention collapsed once incentives faded.
3. Fragmented experience: Players must navigate multiple wallets, dApps, and tokens with no unified identity, rewards, or progression.
4. No physical anchor: Every major gaming revolution was driven by a console or device. Web3 still lacks a consumer-grade entry point that merges gameplay, culture, and ownership.

The result is an ecosystem where friction outweighs fun, culture takes a back seat to speculation, and the breakout product for mass adoption has yet to emerge.

# The Play Solana SuperHUB

The Play Solana SuperHUB re-architects Web3 gaming from first principles. It integrates hardware, software, and culture into a single system where every layer reinforces the [others.At](http://others.At) its foundation is a single physical entry point: the PSG1 handheld console. Around it, a modular ecosystem connects games, wallets, identity, branded IP, and rewards. This design provides players with a unified experience where onboarding, progression, and engagement flow naturally without the friction of multiple tools or fragmented interfaces.This is not another isolated dApp. It is a distribution engine designed to unify gameplay, ownership, and culture at scale.

# A Vertically Integrated Gaming Stack

A New Game Boy for a New Internet  
PSG1 is a powerful, retro-futuristic handheld console engineered for modern gaming. It combines high-performance hardware, a premium OLED display, and a built-in crypto wallet in a sleek, portable form. The device runs EchOS, a custom Android-based operating system tailored for gaming, and integrates SvalGuard, a security layer that streamlines wallet authentication, staking, and in-game transactions.

**A Growing Universe for Gaming**  
The Play Solana Gaming Library curates native and third-party titles into one launcher. Flagships like Play Solana: Origins transform onboarding into gameplay, teaching staking, swaps, and NFTs through fun-first design. Integrations like BONK Arena demonstrate how community-driven tokens evolve into playable ecosystems.

**A Gateway for Rewards and Identity**  
Play<Dex> is the platform hub where players complete quests, stake, climb leaderboards, and track progress within the ecosystem. Play<ID> provides persistent, on-chain identity across devices, binding rewards and reputation to every interaction.

**On-Chain Identity as Culture**  
Play Solana is building IP for the future. <Player1> and <Player2> are not collectibles; they are living identity layers tied to progression, governance, and community. Together, they form the foundation of an evolving on-chain reputation system.

**DeFi Woven Into Gameplay**  
In the SuperHUB, DeFi becomes part of the play loop. Validator rewards, staking, and swaps are embedded directly into games and consoles. Integrations like Jupiter Mobile Wallet deliver institutional-grade DeFi tools without browser extensions, turning financial engagement into natural gameplay.

# Real Partners. Real Products. Real Traction.

The Play Solana SuperHUB is not a concept. It is already live, validated through real integrations, trusted partners, and tangible use cases across gaming, DeFi, and culture. Each case demonstrates how the SuperHUB converts community momentum and infrastructure into active player engagement.

IP Distribution Engine: BONK Arena  
Developed with BRAVO READY and the BONK community, BONK Arena shows how meme-driven, token-first communities can evolve into fully playable ecosystems. Native deployment on PSG1, combined with co-branded hardware, turns cultural energy into sustained gameplay.

# DeFi in Your Pocket: Jupiter Mobile Wallet

Jupiter’s institutional-grade DeFi suite is embedded directly into the PSG1 launcher through SvalGuard. Players access swaps, staking, and other DeFi tools from the same console where they play. No browser extensions or third-party apps are required. This integration demonstrates how SuperHUB makes advanced finance seamless and accessible.

# Cultural IP Activation: Pudgy Penguins

Pudgy Penguins, one of Web3’s most recognizable cultural brands, is expanding its universe across both hardware and gameplay through Play Solana. Co-branded consoles and upcoming IRL activations transform community fandom into on-chain utility, proving that cultural IP can become a driving force for attention.

# New Market Creation: MoonPay Exclusive Edition

MoonPay leverages PSG1 as a premium distribution channel for its partners and high-profile users. This initiative highlights an entirely new category of digital-physical (“phygital”) products: co-branded gaming hardware that merges exclusivity, ownership, and distribution into one model.Together, these cases illustrate the positive flywheel of the SuperHUB: more IP collaborations lead to stronger distribution, which drives higher engagement, increases demand, and ultimately sustains retention.

# Conclusion: A New Foundation for Web3 Gaming

Web3 gaming does not just need better games; it needs a better foundation.The Play Solana SuperHUB delivers that foundation: hardware, games, identity, and DeFi working in unison. It replaces fragmentation with cohesion, speculation with culture, and barriers with accessibility.This is not another platform. It is a growth loop, a cultural layer, and a distribution engine designed to bring Web3 gaming into the [mainstream.Play](http://mainstream.Play) Solana is not following trends. It is redefining what a gaming ecosystem can be.

Gaming will never be the same!

>After beating Microsoft by 34% on the GAIA benchmark, it was time to prove Coral's performance in real-world apps.  
  
With Coral v1, application devs can rent on-demand AI agents and build software 10x faster.  
  
We also help agent devs monetise their AI agents to earn on-chain and participate in an open agent economy.  
  
Coral's payment infrastructure, built on [@solana](https://x.com/solana) and powered by [$CORAL](https://x.com/search?q=%24CORAL&src=cashtag_click), helps devs get paid fairly every time their agents are used.

Together, we challenged devs to use reusable AI agents to:  
  
a) build a production-ready AI app

>b) create AI agents that others can reuse.

>We received over 3,000 registrations from around the world to compete for $100k in prizes.

>This was not your typical hackathon.  
  
We wanted to make the Internet of Agents Hackathon the foundation for the next AI startups.  
  
So, we offered hands-on support to all devs.  
  
→ Our co-founders [@omni\_georgio](https://x.com/omni_georgio) [@caelumforder](https://x.com/caelumforder) and hackathon mentors like Fergus McKenzie-Wilson hosted in-depth workshops (online + IRL)  
  
→ Our hackathon partners offered API credits and support for hackathon devs  
  
→ Together with [@unicorn\_mafia](https://x.com/unicorn_mafia), we hosted a one-week Hacker House in NYC. We flew in London's top 20 AI devs to build with us and compete in the Internet of Agents Hackathon.

If you’re into Solana, the answer isn’t static—it follows a **decaying issuance schedule** and interacts with **staking** and **network fees**. We built [**cryptoinflation.eu**](https://cryptoinflation.eu/) to make SOL’s supply dynamics easy to explain and compare with other chains.

On our Solana page you’ll find:

* **Current annualized issuance** (protocol inflation) and how it has been **declining over time** toward a long-run rate.
* **Historical curve & epoch views** so you can see the step-down of inflation and the effect of validator set changes.
* **Net supply change** that factors in fee effects and any burns, giving you a cleaner picture of real dilution for holders.
* **Staking context**: rewards come from inflation and fees; validator commission and stake distribution shape *yields*, while issuance shapes *dilution*.
* **Comparisons** with PoW and other PoS networks to show how Solana’s decaying schedule differs from fixed or variable models.

Why it matters: the same market cap can hide very different dilution paths. Clear charts + plain-English notes help you discuss epochs, priority fees, and staking economics without spreadsheets.

We’d love feedback from Solana validators, builders, and educators: which extra metrics (e.g., effective inflation after fees, stake concentration overlays, MEV/priority-fee views) would make this most useful for dashboards, talks, or meetup slides?

>🧵 (3/10) 2. Don't marry the idea, marry the project  
  
\- Don't be afraid to pivot if necessary.  
\- There is no reason or rule that you have to stick to your initial idea.



>🧵 (4/10) 3. Build an MVP  
  
\- If you are non-technical, let AI tools help you.  
\- It doesn't need to be perfect.

Bitwise’s CEO said at Token2049 that Solana’s faster unstake process could make it easier to package for a staking ETF than Ethereum.

The claim is about plumbing, not hype. Fund desks need smooth creations and redemptions. Shorter exit times and predictable staking flows make their jobs simpler.

The SEC has updated rules for listing spot crypto ETFs. That can shorten timelines when products meet the requirements. In that world, clean operations matter more.

This is one company’s view, not an approval. What actually ships will depend on custody, staking setup, and risk controls. Timelines can still slip.

If a Solana staking ETF lands, what must it include. Broad validator distribution. Clear fee disclosure. On chain reporting of stake moves. No reuse of customer assets without consent. What else would make you trust it.

For holders considering staking strategies around potential ETF launches, tax treatment matters regardless of whether you're staking directly or through a fund. Staking rewards hit as income when received, then basis tracking on those rewards when you eventually sell. Been using awaken to handle this automatically since manually logging daily staking drops and their USD values at receipt time isn't realistic at scale. The lot tracking becomes critical when you're staking meaningful amounts over time.

The operational advantage Solana has on unstaking speed is real for fund mechanics, but the regulatory path and institutional custody setup will determine timing more than technical specs.",Ecosystem,True,,False

TLDR Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model applied to Solana (SOL) by 21Shares suggests the token is significantly undervalued

with 11% discount in the DCF model. Sol should be $1800 USD right now.  


if Solana was priced like etherium is priced right now it would be:  $708 USD per coin.

If Solana was priced like AVAX is priced right now it would be: $1828 USD per coin

like Ton: $2199 USD

Eventually SOL will catch up to what it is actually worth. It is inevitable.

# Introducing, Keel: Solana's Capital Engine

# Solana’s Breakout Point

>Yet, if Solana is to achieve the vision of internet capital markets then technology alone is not enough - liquidity catalysts and enablers are required.

# The Chicken, the Egg, and the Liquidity Layer

* Robust lending and cross-asset liquidity
* Rates that remain stable and competitive
* Institutional scale demand for tokenized asset issuances

>Scalable capital and liquidity will be the enablers for Solana’s onchain financial markets to reach the next stage of growth and maturity.

# Keel is Solana’s Capital Engine

https://preview.redd.it/fuk86uoqzbsf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=39442b4922474d0c383925678e3f27474761f5a0

Powered by Sky (formerly MakerDAO), the issuer of USDS, and one of DeFi’s most proven protocols, Keel is purpose-built to provide the structural support that Solana’s financial markets require to scale.

# A $2.5bn Catalyst for Growth

As an onchain capital allocator with an initial roadmap of $2.5bn, Keel will kickstart the capital allocation flywheel, enabling conditions for more capital to enter the Solana ecosystem.

# A Value Multiplier

By plugging into Sky’s infrastructure, Keel is empowered to be a multiplicative force for the Solana ecosystem — utilizing over-collateralized debt to support credit creation and improve liquidity.

# A Liquidity Layer

The Keel liquidity layer will be integrated directly with Solana’s largest DeFi protocols and tokenized asset issuers, dynamically reallocating stablecoin liquidity to provide the stability and depth required to operate at scale.

# Areas of Focus

These are the initial areas of focus for the Keel Capital Engine, and some of the benefits it will aim to generate for the Solana ecosystem:

# Stablecoin Lending

* Deeper, more liquid stablecoin lending markets - enabling leverage on high quality collateral and the ability to borrow in much larger sizes, with greater capital efficiency.

# Stablecoin Swaps

* Greater depth and stability for stablecoin swaps - by providing swap liquidity for leading stablecoin pairs, Keel reinforces ecosystem depth and peg stability.

# Liquidity and TVL Bootstrapping

* Support for bootstrapping new issuances and DeFi products from zero to one with substantial stablecoin reserves vs third-party capital.

# Savings

* Enabling a predictable, stable, and continuously compounding yield, with native staking and redemption free of fees or lockup, for individuals through to institutions.

# RWA Yields, Redemption, and Secondary Liquidity

* Removing friction for tokenized assets and RWAs at scale by allocating at size into tokenized yield-bearing assets and strategies, and improving onchain liquidity, redemptions, and liquidations by bridging traditional finance with always-on DeFi markets.
