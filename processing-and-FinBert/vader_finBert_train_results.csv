p_1nxnlcb,"If This Is the Bull Market, Then Altcoins Are Finished This cycle feels completely off for anyone who isnt holding Bitcoin. Im not talking about meme coins or the latest #1832 CMC gem promoted by a YouTube gambler. I mean the supposed blue chips. The serious, established projects that actually built, shipped, and survived. **Heres where things stand (approx. numbers):** * **ADA** peaked around **$2.90**, now sits near **$0.85**, about 70% down. * **LINK** has improved but is still roughly 5060% below its ATH. Market CAP close to ATH (sh\*t tokenomics?) * **DOT** peaked near **$55**, now **$4.29**, over 90% drop. * **AAVE** has recovered somewhat but still trades at roughly half its ATH. * **ALGO** has been bleeding for two years with no clear bottom in sight. These are not vaporware projects. They have real ecosystems, partnerships, and communities. Yet the market refuses to reward them. Even after two years of recovery, they are still deep in red territory. **Now let's look at Ethereum.** ETH should be leading this cycle. Instead, it is just hovering around its previous ATH. At this stage, ETH should be in clear price discovery, not struggling to hold ground. Every other week someone posts about supply shock and institutional demand. Charts showing exchange reserves collapsing from 16 million to 9 million ETH. Every previous time this happened, a massive rally followed. **This time, nothing.** So where is the rally? Where is the institutional bid that was supposed to push ETH into a new era? If this is the cycle top, then something is broken. **And where is retail?** Yes, we know the global economy is weak. The US economy is shaky, inflation is sticky, interest rates are high, the job market is rolling over, and retail investors have been burned too many times. People are tired. They remember Terra, Celsius, FTX, and every other implosion that wiped out savings. They learned their lesson. They are sitting out, holding cash, or chasing AI stocks instead (the new crypto get rich quick scheme). But if the smart money and the supply shock narratives are both real, why is price action this lifeless? Where is the demand thats supposed to absorb the drained supply? **But thats not the whole story.** Because the truth is, money is flowing. Just not here. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and even gold are at or near all-time highs. Liquidity is alive and well. Capital hasnt disappeared. Its simply choosing not to touch altcoins. Institutions are back in equities and Bitcoin. Retail is speculating on Nvidia instead of LINK or DOT. The excuse that the macro environment is too tough doesnt hold when traditional markets are booming and Bitcoin is making new highs. The problem isnt (only) the economy, its demand for alts. **Old playbook: dead?** Maybe the uncomfortable reality is that the old playbook no longer works. The traditional rotation pattern of BTC pumping first, ETH following, and alts going parabolic appears to be finished. Capital now stops at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes it touches Solana and a few new narratives. A big part of liquidity in crypto is also spread thin across thousands of useless projects that still somehow trade daily. Thats it. If even Ethereum, with its ETF narrative, deflationary supply, and institutional adoption story, cannot decisively break its previous highs, what chance do the others have? If ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, and ALGO fail to reach their previous peaks in this environment, they will not recover in the next one. The next bear market will bury them for good. This may be the first cycle where altcoin believers realize that not every strong project will come back. Bitcoin and a handful of layer-1s will survive. The rest will quietly fade away. Maybe alt season is not delayed. Maybe it didnt ever start. Maybe it ended already four years ago? And maybe this cycle is the moment when everyone finally looks around and says, Is this really it? If ETH and alts dont pick up by the end of the year, the entire crypto market faces two possible outcomes: 1. **Most Altcoins collapse completely in the next bear market.** Retail wont come back. Total market liquidity shrinks. The old pattern of alt buyers eventually converting into long-term Bitcoin holders disappears. Even Bitcoin takes a hit, because as much as people like to pretend otherwise, institutions still need retail to dump on. 2. **Everyone simply buys Bitcoin next time.** Retail and institutions both pile into BTC, ignoring altcoins altogether. One-off alts will still rise, but mostly not. Bitcoin becomes the only real trade left. But this is less likely, since the main appeal of altcoins has always been their higher risk-to-reward upside.

Of course it could just be me but there has been a sense of normalization in btcs rise to six figures even though its an all-time high around $122k. I remember the previous runs and the cultural wave they had on retail interest doesnt seem to exist as much. However, it is not bad necessarily. The retail fomo and SM hype also acted as catalysts in previous runs. But the multiple boom cycles may have created a new boring normal to mainstream adoption. Furthermore, Financial Twitter has shifted focus to AI companies (NVIDIA, OpenAI) and politics from btc as NVIDIA and other techs are riding the AI hype train. Also, psychological aspects such as btc rise from 110k to 122k is less emotionally and attentively impactful as 1k to 20k. The institutional money flowing into Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries has fundamentally altered the market dynamics too. Tools like awaken.tax are becoming more relevant as traders move from speculative plays to actual portfolio management.

p_1o287jt,"I've been in this market since 2016 and in crypto even longer (and haven't raged quit yet). Here's what I'm seeing right now from what I've been through before. Sure ""nobody knows shit about fuck"", but after a decade you start to get a feel for this beast. Sure ""nobody knows shit about fuck"", and yet people repeat the same mistakes, and the market keeps having familiar things coming back. Not quiet like clockwork, but close enough. This is just my personal opinion based on what I learned, so take it with a heap of salt. In **bold** is the direct answer. # Is the bull cycle over? With Fed rate cuts just starting? That's highly doubtful. Plus there's a long list of things going right at the moment. For a proper crash and a bubble to burst, you first need a proper bubble. **We're probably not that far from it, but this market still needs a little more bubble.** Remember, what they say about market irrationality. # When will the bull cycle end and crash? Fed rates could potentially drag this out longer into early 2026, but don't expect that narrative to stay fresh for too long either. Ultimately, the sooner we get some big rallies, FOMO, and mania (but milder than previous cycles because of tapering volatility), the closer we will be to a crash. If this recent rally from $108K to $126K has another leg like that, we won't actually be too far from a proper bubble. Because the market loves to create self-fulfilled prophecies, **I would set your clocks for a crash somewhere between mid-November to mid-January**. And clockwork is the one thing that has been somewhat reliable in this market. Even if everything is rosy at the beginning of 2026, the forces of this market are too strong for a bull market to be extended for too long. # How high Bitcoin will go? Make sure you don't look at Bitcoin's history linearly, and start looking at the diminishing returns and tapering down of its volatility. It's a curve. Now that we're deep in the bull market, the fog is beginning to lift. For me the sweet spot of that peak is between **$129K-$149K**. If I had to go with an exact price: $136.9K. I hope I'm not underestimating FOMO here, and overplaying the ""tapering down"" narrative. $150K target seems too popular now. # What about alt season? That's never gonna happen right? Has no one else seen the glimpses and foreshadowing last November? It was very revealing about the nature of the market and how it still behaves with alts. With just enough FOMO in the market, you get people panic buying alts. The market has been a little more tamed since, with only one other little injection of FOMO and another alt rally during the summer. A lower mania phase at the end of Bitcoin's bullrun could spell a milder and shorter alt season. So **this alt season could really be milder** with ETH staying under $6K, but other major alts getting maybe only 30%-100% rallies, and a few lucky ones maybe getting 2x-3x. This in a scenario where Bitcoin only hits $136.9K. **If we get some big BTC mania rally, then yes, there will be some big alt rallies.** Why? Because people are greedy. # What about the bear winter, is it gonna be as brutal as usual? Bitcoin *should* see its mildest winter. With a maximum drop down by only 60%-70%. But what about MSTR, ETFs, big institutions and governments?

p_1o0nbhz,"10 years ago I made these threads about buying 85 Bitcoin with my $20k student line of credit instead of going to College and everyone ridiculed me. It worked out for me back then but heres why I wouldnt recommend buying btc on credit today. Here's some threads from 10 years ago about me buying 85 btc on my $20k student line of credit instead of going to college: 1. [ 2. [ 3. [ 4. [ there was more threads but lots of them got removed by mods and I got banned from some subs as well, that's how much people were against this back then. I'm seeing a lot of posts lately from people asking about buying Bitcoin on credit. In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack. The problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding. Well that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains. Also 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason. For clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out. And sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin. And even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.",2025-10-07 19:40:56,KidEliteTrader,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit,ago thread student line credit instead college ridicule work wouldn recommend buying credit today thread ago student line credit instead college thread lot remove mod ban sub lot lately ask credit turn student line credit instead college talk idiot work great nascent technology hold initial position double greatly grow stack problem credit free long determine leave open wipe financial entity manipulation lot government corporate central bank game play today early thing happen organically simple supply demand cause fact new technology wasn demand point believe tech tech solid pay line mainstream result explode dream realize mainstream fact mainstream mean achieve deep integration financial institution government entity manipulate like traditional asset manufactured downtrend cause financial institution let credit wipe lose organic pressure government tradfi manipulation push wasn problem decide literally print fiat unfortunately space today care fiat play directly hand financial institution central bank entity cause recession maybe create credit wipe way instead credit downtrend ride instead downtrend pay credit result miss gain ago marketcap billion today marketcap trillion big order magnitude need today exact percentage marketcap billion double today double trillion need add marketcap course literally dollar don need inject big scale aren frequent daily weekly increase anymore reason clarification course credit properly come ahead risk getting catch downturn big wipe sorry like doomer don want bearish super bullish central bank greatly manipulate wipe control supply possible big plan manipulate like don want want lot etfs treasury recent tradfi integration government control supply risk credit huge today wouldn recommend want beat government tradfi trash try corrupt lol beat game credit position open happy able use tradfi system use credit purchase real currency moral fiat good prevail,0.123,0.59,0.287,0.995,positive,neutral

p_1nwug66,"Ethereum Supply Is Drying Up Fast And Every Time This Happened Before, a Massive Rally Followed As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum exchange reserves keeps going down in quite fast ways and most people are not paying attention. These reserves are falling again and every time this has happened before its been the calm before a massive rally. According to the Tweet and the chart: * **2020-2021:** ETH reserves dropped from 16M to 10M while price barely moved. At that time gas fees were sky high , the network was congested and most of the traders were asleep. Then demand suddenly pumped thanks to events like the UNI airdrop and ETH exploded from \~$400 to nearly $4,800. * **2022-2023:** This time another huge outflow happened. This time from 15M to 9M ETH. This happened during the deep in the bear market, FTX was collapsing, banks were failing but supply quietly bled off exchanges. Once macro conditions improved, ETH rocketed from \~$1,100 to \~$4,000. * **2024-2025 (Now):** We are currently sitting at historic lows (\~9.2M ETH) while price is around $4000-$4,500. This means ETH is being accumulated and pulled off exchanges, even if price is not exploding yet. This is important because supply leaving exchanges is like draining a bathtub while the tap is still running. If buyers keep coming and sellers eventually run dry, the result is explosive and the price surges because there is simply nothing left to sell and buyers still want it.

p_1o5rlk9,"My thoughts on a bull market peak for this cycle After this flash crash we had this past Friday, I've been seeing a ton of stuff about the bull market being over, that there will be no alt season, etc. However, after this flash crash I'm actually more much more bullish now, which I'll elaborate on. On Friday we saw the mass liquidation of a bunch of dumbasses leverage trading this market thinking that it was just going to go into a Q4 cycle peak with little to no retracement. During this, we also saw big money players stepping in and loading up on the dip. For instance, Tom Lee's Fundstrat buying up almost 1 BILLION $ in ETH. I'm going to disregard Michael Saylor's recent big purchase of BTC, because he is always buying lol. This event was the equivalent of the COVID crash of 2020 and the FTX liquidation crash of November 2022. Ben Cowen is a very popular youtuber, but I've noticed he is getting a bit weird lately. He kept talking about his ETH target hitting cycle lows, and it ""went home"" to under .02 to BTC back in April. Meanwhile, he continued to bring up the idea that alts needed to go to .25 of the total market before we would see an alt season. However, now that this happened on Friday, he has completely changed his stance, calling for an ETH top of a little over 5k and no alt season lol. Interestingly, on multiple occasions he has brought up how in the 2017 cycle alts hit this .25 target in November of that year and the peak of alt season was January of 2018. People are so god damn bearish and fearful, yet BTC is still trading at around 115k, ETH at over 4k and ADA over 70 cents. Some other variables to consider. The clarity act is still on the table in congress, and once the government shut down ends it's very likely this will pass within the next few weeks. In addition to this, there are further rate cuts on the table and global liquidity is continuing to rise. What we are seeing is eerily similar to late 2017 and I'm expecting a lot of people to get wrecked. I think what is going to happen is we get a massive rally that seemingly comes out of nowhere. You'll see it talked about all over the news and retail FOMO floods into the crypto space. Things will get beyond euphoric and everyone is going to be convinced it will be a super cycle. I wouldn't be surprised to see BTC at 170k+, ETH at 8k+and some alts doing close to a 10x or more from here. However, the retracement will be just as impressive and happen in a matter of a few weeks. As for bear market of 2026. I think we will bottom out around 70-80k, this would be slightly above the highs of 2021, the high of March 2024 and the low of April 2025. We could definitely get into the 60k range, but I think the 50k range is a thing of the past.

p_1o8xjfm,"Two months ago Coinbase told us a full scale alt season was coming The Altcoin Season That Wasn't The crypto community had a moment of genuine excitement on August 14, 2025, when Coinbase published its bullish assessment, signaling that a ""full-scale alt season"" was on the immediate horizon. The Downward Spiral Instead of soaring, altcoins began a substantial and painful drop almost immediately following, and in the months after, the article's publication. The clearest sign of this sentiment shift can be seen in the Altcoin Season Index, a metric intended to gauge the health and momentum of the altcoin space. From its peak in September, this index has collapsed by approximately 68%. The carnage hasn't been limited to the index, either. Individual tokens across the board have suffered deep corrections, with many popular altcoins seeing their values plunge by anywhere from 50% to a staggering 80% from their local highs. This widespread decline paints a picture of a fearful and risk-averse market. Compounding this loss of capital, the Total Market Cap Excluding Bitcoin (Total2)a key indicator for the collective size of the altcoin market, saw its valuation shrink significantly, falling from around $1.7 trillion down to approximately $1.3 trillion. TLDR; the altcoin market has gone from anticipating a feast to enduring a famine, with most coins seeing devastating losses since one of the industry's biggest players suggested the good times were about to start.

p_1o3rrvx,"All my savings, 6 years of DCA, got liquidated last night. I was one of the people who never tried to time the market, was telling others to stay away from leverage, just DCA, yet here I am. Maybe this sad story will contribute to the community. I guess people have different reasons for why they end up using leverage. I don't need to be convinced that Bitcoin is here to stay and it will go up, that's why I was all-in DCAing. Anything left out of my monthly salary would go into Bitcoin. However, in last 1-2 years my monthly expenses rose significantly, and I was upset about not being able to buy as much Bitcoin as I could in the past. This is what led me to the idea that I can make up for that period in 1-2 leverage trades. It all went downhill from there. Last night I lost EVERYTHING - as of today, my total net worth is not far away from the salary I will receive for this month. Everything I got was wiped out, and I'm 36 years old already. The realization of my age, how much time it took me to get to the point I was at before touching the leverage, imagining all the things this money could fix today if I just spent it, all those feelings and thoughts, are devastating beyond my ability to describe it. The feeling of shame, the feeling of letting down family and relatives. I won't ever admit to what has happened to anyone, and I will have to live with this feeling of shame likely for ever. I have seen posts suggesting people are suicidal, I am not, but I very well understand why others may be, going through this horror. What's next for me? I'm trying to convince myself that being 36 and having nothing but a car loan and a few furniture pieces is nothing to worry about, I still have a job and hopefully a few years ahead. I will try to build my cash position and just wait for the cycle end and start deploying cash into BTC when price drops below 90-80k again. Maybe in next 6-7-8 years I will get back to the point I was before I got wiped out. And of course I tell myself I will never touch leverage ever again. This is still a nightmare situation, and I'm coping hard, but what else I can do? I feel helpless. If you are new to Bitcoin and you think you are late, I was there when price hit $4k low in 2020, and was DCAing before and all throughout - today I'm back to round zero savings at the age of 36, with intention to just get back to buying at whatever prices I will get. You can roast me, but this can happen to you, no matter how smart or seasoned you are. One day you may have a random ""valid"" reason to take ""just a little risk"", the next moment you know, you are down to zero. Don't trade, don't use leverage.

p_1o0mmqr,"10 years ago I made these threads about buying 85 Bitcoin with my $20k student line of credit instead of going to College and everyone ridiculed me. It worked out for me back then but heres why I wouldnt recommend buying btc on credit today. Here's some threads from 10 years ago about me buying 85 btc on my $20k student line of credit instead of going to college: 1. [ 2. [ 3. [ Couldn't post all the threads because automod removed my post when I do but you can check my profile and look at my oldest posts to see them. And there was more threads but lots of them got removed by mods and I got ""kicked out"" from some subs as well, that's how much people were against this back then. I'm seeing a lot of posts lately from people asking about buying Bitcoin on credit. In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack. The problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding. Well that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains. Also 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason. For clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out. And sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin. And even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.",2025-10-07 19:16:38,KidEliteTrader,post,bitcoin,,Reddit,ago thread student line credit instead college ridicule work wouldn recommend buying credit today thread ago student line credit instead college couldn thread automod remove check profile look old thread lot remove mod kick sub lot lately ask credit turn student line credit instead college talk idiot work great nascent technology hold initial position double greatly grow stack problem credit free long determine leave open wipe financial entity manipulation lot government corporate central bank game play today early thing happen organically simple supply demand cause fact new technology wasn demand point believe tech tech solid pay line mainstream result explode dream realize mainstream fact mainstream mean achieve deep integration financial institution government entity manipulate like traditional asset manufactured downtrend cause financial institution let credit wipe lose organic pressure government tradfi manipulation push wasn problem decide literally print fiat unfortunately space today care fiat play directly hand financial institution central bank entity cause recession maybe create credit wipe way instead credit downtrend ride instead downtrend pay credit result miss gain ago marketcap billion today marketcap trillion big order magnitude need today exact percentage marketcap billion double today double trillion need add marketcap course literally dollar don need inject big scale aren frequent daily weekly increase anymore reason clarification course credit properly come ahead risk getting catch downturn big wipe sorry like doomer don want bearish super bullish central bank greatly manipulate wipe control supply possible big plan manipulate like don want want lot etfs treasury recent tradfi integration government control supply risk credit huge today wouldn recommend want beat government tradfi trash try corrupt lol beat game credit position open happy able use tradfi system use credit purchase real currency moral fiat good prevail,0.111,0.606,0.283,0.9956,positive,neutral

The Department of Justice has seized about $15 billion worth of bitcoin held in cryptocurrency wallets owned by a man who oversaw a massive pig butchering fraud operation based in Cambodia, prosecutors said Tuesday. The seizure is the largest forfeiture action by the DOJ in history. An indictment charging the alleged pig butcher, Chen Zhi, was unsealed Tuesday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York. Zhi, who is also known as Vincent, remains at large, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York. Zhi was identified in court filings as the founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group, a multinational business conglomerate based in Cambodia, which operates dozens of business entities in more than 30 countries. The Prince Groups operation included forced-labor scam compounds across Cambodia, the U.S. Attorneys Office said in a press release. Individuals held against their will in the compounds engaged in cryptocurrency investment fraud schemes, known as pig butchering scams, that stole billions of dollars from victims in the United States and around the world, the release said. The scams duped people contacted via social media and messaging applications online into transferring cryptocurrency into accounts controlled by the scheme with false promises that the crypto would be invested and produce profits, according to the office. In reality, the funds were stolen from the victims and laundered for the benefit of the perpetrators, the release said. The scam perpetrators often built relationships with their victims over time, earning their trust before stealing their funds. Prosecutors said that hundreds of people were trafficked and forced to work in the scam compounds, often under the threat of violence. Zhi and a network of top executives in the Prince Group are accused of using political influence in multiple countries to protect their criminal enterprise and paid bribes to public officials to avoid actions by law enforcement authorities targeting the scheme, according to prosecutors.",2025-10-14 16:35:36,Fluid_Garden8512,post,bitcoin,,Reddit,doj seize billion massive pig butcher scam base cambodia large history key point department justice seize billion worth hold man oversee massive pig butcher fraud operation base cambodia prosecutor seizure large forfeiture action doj history indictment charge allege pig butcherer chen zhi unseal federal court brooklyn new york department justice seize billion worth hold wallet man oversee massive pig butcher fraud operation base cambodia prosecutor tuesday seizure large forfeiture action doj history indictment charge allege pig butcher chen zhi unseal tuesday federal court brooklyn new york zhi vincent remain large accord attorney office eastern district new york zhi identify court filing founder chairman prince holding group multinational business conglomerate base cambodia operate dozen business entity country prince group operation include force labor scam compound cambodia attorney office press release individual hold compound engage investment fraud scheme pig butcher scam steal billion dollar victim united states world release scam dupe contact social medium message application online transfer account control scheme false promise invest produce profit accord office reality fund steal victim launder benefit perpetrator release scam perpetrator build relationship victim earn trust steal fund prosecutor traffic force work scam compound threat violence zhi network executive prince group accuse political influence multiple country protect criminal enterprise pay bribe public official avoid action law enforcement authority target scheme accord prosecutor,0.266,0.626,0.108,-0.9929,negative,negative

Think about it  it was created by an anonymous figure (or group) who vanished right after launch. Governments and institutions that once called it dangerous are now quietly investing in it. Meanwhile, huge mining operations in certain countries control a massive share of the hash rate, and ETF approvals seem to come right when retail hype spikes. Its almost as if Bitcoin, which started as a symbol of financial freedom, is slowly being pulled into the same centralized power structures it was meant to escape. What if thats been the plan all along? What if decentralization is just the illusion keeping everyone hooked while institutions quietly consolidate control behind the scenes?

p_1nyk3af,"The Quietest All-Time High Bitcoin just reached a new all-time high at $125,296, climbing roughly 1.8% in the past day and about 13% over the week, yet the market feels unusually calm. Theres no noise or sudden rush of retail excitement, no flood of speculative chatter that usually surrounds a move like this. Instead, the mood feels almost reflective, as if the market itself understands that this run is being built differently. Most of the strength appears to be coming from deep spot demand as institutions quietly accumulate through ETFs, banks raise their forecasts with growing confidence, and corporate treasuries continue to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Exchange reserves have dropped to their lowest level in seven years, meaning theres less liquidity available to absorb new demand, so even modest inflows are having an amplified effect on price. From a technical perspective, the setup still leans cleanly bullish. Momentum remains firm without being overheated, the RSI sits comfortably below the overbought zone, and the breakout above the $123K range has held without much resistance. Historically, October has been one of Bitcoins stronger months, and that seasonal rhythm seems to be unfolding once again. Yet what makes this moment stand out isnt just the numbers or the structure, its the silence surrounding it. This feels like an all-time high built on steady conviction rather than emotion, where accumulation outweighs speculation and confidence replaces hype. If the earlier cycles were driven by noise and euphoria, this one seems to be defined by patience and quiet strength.",2025-10-05 10:51:11,SuccessOdd382,post,bitcoin,,Reddit,quiet high reach new high climb roughly past week feel unusually calm noise sudden rush retail excitement flood speculative chatter usually surround like instead mood feel reflective understand run build differently strength appear come deep spot demand institution quietly accumulate etfs bank raise forecast grow confidence corporate treasury continue add balance sheet exchange reserve drop low level seven mean liquidity available absorb new demand modest inflow amplified effect technical perspective setup lean cleanly bullish momentum remain firm overheat rsi sit comfortably overbought zone breakout range hold resistance historically october strong month seasonal rhythm unfold moment stand isn number structure silence surround feel like high build steady conviction emotion accumulation outweigh speculation confidence replace hype early cycle drive noise euphoria define patience quiet strength,0.048,0.689,0.264,0.9843,positive,negative

Heres what it looks like today: * Instant deposits of USDC and ETH directly to Base (up to $500/week) * Apple Pay support (debit cards only for now) * No ID checks required for US residents (including NY!) * No fees for the first $50,000 deposited * All settling natively on Base without extra hops or bridge delays Why this matters: * Coinbase Ramp provides a secure and compliant fiat-to-crypto flow, but funds arrive in a **self-custody smart wallet**, not a custodial account * Deposits go straight to Base, avoiding mainnet friction and unnecessary costs for new users * Waiving early fees allows people to test the flow without losing value on the way in Onboarding remains one of the hardest problems in crypto. Our goal is to remove barriers for new users while keeping the experience fully onchain and user-owned. The integration is live today. I would love feedback from this community, whether its testing the flow or critiquing the approach (L2, L2, I know). We are building for scale, but also want to make sure we get it right for early adopters.

p_1o7ebmz,"Bhutan national ID system on-chain and ""one person, one unit of stake"" Now that Bhutan has put their national ID system on Ethereum, I thought I'd raise the topic of ""one person, one unit of stake"" (term from Bryan Ford) and how every country in the world could be running their own national blockchain within a few years or a decade. This is a topic that is not given much focus by leaders in ""blockchain"", although Gavin Wood has increasingly talked about it in the last couple of years and made it a priority to migrate Polkadot to ""one person, one unit of stake"", what I call ""proof-of-suffrage"". To me, it is inevitable, and a logical next step, that every country in the world starts to run such a system. For traditional national IDs to be secure on-chain, the newer generation ""digital ID"" is needed where the personal data is held by the individual and proofs are generated with ""trapdoors"" and such (so they cannot be leaked) and possibly things like ""zero knowledge proofs"" to prove ""is over 18"" (I do not understand how those works but it seems like it could apply there). Such are starting to make their way into national ID systems and Bhutan is (I assume) using that technology. This all seems like something that people all over the world could unite around, both people in a presumed ""crypto community"" and then also all other people who are part of the ""nation state community"" or ""international community"". A very good thing is that once a very good standard for ""proof-of-suffrage blockchain"" has been produced, every country can use that (incl. Bhutan...) but it can also be used with alternative national ID systems such as video pseudonym parties from 2015/2018.",2025-10-15 16:34:36,johanngr,post,ethereum,,Reddit,bhutan national system chain person unit stake bhutan national system raise topic person unit stake term bryan ford country world run national decade topic focus leader gavin wood increasingly talk couple priority migrate polkadot person unit stake proof suffrage inevitable logical step country world start run system traditional national secure chain new generation digital need personal datum hold individual proof generate trapdoor leak possibly thing like zero knowledge proof prove understand work like apply start way national system bhutan assume technology like world unite presume community nation state community international community good thing good standard proof suffrage produce country use incl bhutan alternative national system video pseudonym party,0.02,0.828,0.152,0.9325,positive,neutral

Ive spent the past two years alongside my fellow director Louis Giles making *Code is Law*, a feature-length documentary about some of the most infamous exploits in Ethereums history. The film explores a wave of massive smart contract hacks where attackers stole millions  and then claimed it was all perfectly legal. Starting with **The DAO**, it traces a lineage of exploits including **Indexed Finance**, **KyberSwap**, and **Mango Markets**, where the phrase *code is law* went from meme to courtroom defence. We speak to the developers, investigators, and white hats who lived through these events - including the hunt for **Andean Medjedovic**, a teenage math prodigy who stole **$65 million** and became the first hacker to claim code is law. Medjedovic is now a **fugitive from FBI charges** who has been on the run for almost five years. The film also covers the case of Avraham Eisenberg, whose $110 million Mango Markets exploit became the first courtroom test of the 'code is law' defence - and set a legal precedent with global implications. **TRAILER:**[ **Streaming from Oct 21 on Apple TV, Amazon Prime & Vimeo** More info / clips / updates:[ Full release info:[ Journeyman.tv]( **Featured cast (alongside X usernames):** **The DAO**  Griff Green - Community Manager (@thegrifft)  Christoph Jentzsch - Creator (@ChrJentzsch)  Simon Jentzsch - Co-creator (@simon\_jentzsch)  Lefteris Karapetsas - Developer (@lefterisJP)  Fabian Vogelsteller - Curator (@feindura) **Indexed Finance**  Laurence Day - Technical contributor @functi0nZer0)  Dillon Kellar - Founder (@d1ll0nk) **White Hat Group & Investigators**  Ogle (@cryptogle) **Security Researchers**  Daniel Luca (@cleanunicorn)  Goncalo Sá (@feindura) **Academics**  Paul Dylan-Ennis (@post\_polar\_) **Ask me anything about the film, the real cases it covers, or the legal/ethical minefield of 'code is law.'

p_1o3x8pj,"Why Cross-Chain Privacy Infrastructure Will Define Ethereums Next DeFi Cycle As someone whos spent years deep in DeFi and cross-chain routing, Im genuinely excited to see how far Ethereums privacy stack has come. Between the Ethereum Foundations new privacy cluster, tools like Kohaku, Privacy Pools, Aztec, and Nightfall, it finally feels like the ecosystem has accepted that privacy has come to stay. But lets be honest: as good as these developments are, they only solve part of the equation. Too many people still think that zero-knowledge rollups, mixers, or private L2s are enough, but they arent imo. The new benchmark for privacy does not lie on just making transactions private inside one network, it lies on keeping them private across every route. Every time you move assets from Ethereum to another chain, you expose the pattern. Bridges and DEX aggregators still broadcast wallet routes, swap sizes, and intent. Chain analytics just needs consistency. If a wallets moves are visible across multiple networks, privacy breaks down long before compliance ever enters the picture. Thats why I think the next phase for Ethereum privacy wont be another L2 or ZK primitive, itll be a cross-chain privacy infrastructure. This is where I see Houdiniswap coming in. Projects like Houdiniswap are starting to define this new layer. Its not a mixer, and its not an L2. Its a privacy focused cross-chain DEX aggregator, supporting 4000+ tokens across 100+ blockchains, designed around one principle: compliant privacy at the routing layer. Each swap uses a single-use wallet to prevent address linkage, and the protocols dual exchange system randomizes base layer paths so even the route itself doesnt form an easily traceable pattern. The architecture separates routing logic from custody, meaning no shared pools, no bridge custody, and no mixer risk. When you put that next to the current landscape, you can see the difference clearly: * Aztec and Nightfall are strong inside Ethereum but stay single domain. * Railgun delivers on-chain privacy within EVMs but not cross ecosystem. * 1inch and Rubic excel at aggregation, but expose every hop to explorers and bots. * Houdiniswap merges both worlds: privacy, liquidity, and compliance in one routing layer. Why It Matters Ethereums privacy roadmap from PSEs primitives to Kohakus wallet SDK is setting a new standard for how assets move within the network. But the moment those assets cross chains, all that protection disappears unless the routing layer itself is private and compliant. Cross-chain privacy remains one of the most underserved opportunities in DeFi, and Houdiniswaps compliant routing system is built specifically to close that gap. This gives both professional traders and institutions a way to execute across ecosystems without turning their wallets into public datasets. For retail users, it keeps DeFi usable without giving up control. Were watching privacy evolve from mixing to provable, compliant confidentiality and the protocols that can deliver it across chains will define the next stage of DeFi. Between Aztec, Nightfall, Railgun, and now Houdiniswap, the privacy space on and around Ethereum is heating up fast. Im genuinely excited to see which approach leads because whichever one does will set the standard for the next decade of private, compliant, and truly cross-chain finance.",2025-10-11 15:37:13,penarhw,post,ethereum,,Reddit,cross chain privacy infrastructure define cycle spend deep cross chain routing genuinely excited far privacy stack come foundation new privacy cluster tool like kohaku privacy pool aztec nightfall finally feel like ecosystem accept privacy come stay let honest good development solve equation zero knowledge rollup mixer private aren imo new benchmark privacy lie transaction private inside network lie private route asset chain expose pattern bridge dex aggregator broadcast wallet route swap size intent chain analytic need consistency wallet visible multiple network privacy break long compliance enter picture phase privacy win primitive cross chain privacy infrastructure houdiniswap come project like houdiniswap start define new layer mixer privacy focus cross chain dex aggregator support design principle compliant privacy routing layer swap use single use wallet prevent address linkage protocol dual exchange system randomize base layer path route doesn form easily traceable pattern architecture separate route logic custody mean share pool bridge custody mixer risk current landscape difference clearly aztec nightfall strong inside stay single domain railgun deliver chain privacy evms cross ecosystem inch rubic excel aggregation expose hop explorer bot houdiniswap merge world privacy liquidity compliance routing layer matter privacy roadmap pse primitive kohaku wallet sdk set new standard asset network moment asset cross chain protection disappear routing layer private compliant cross chain privacy remain underserved opportunity houdiniswap compliant routing system build specifically close gap professional institution way execute ecosystem turn wallet public dataset retail user usable control watch privacy evolve mix provable compliant confidentiality protocol deliver chain define stage aztec nightfall railgun houdiniswap privacy space heat fast genuinely excited approach lead whichever set standard decade private compliant truly cross chain finance,0.023,0.787,0.189,0.9928,positive,neutral

p_1nxv7br,"3-phase commit for true Raiden network All decentralized multihop payments like Raiden/Lightning (and also Ryan Fugger's base layer) have historically used a 2-phase commit that defaults to cancel the payment to manage the attack vector of money reserved for payment being stuck for all eternity. This solution brings with it the risk of a penalty (note, only on *one* of the phases) that may end up imposed on an innocent intermediary. The original solution to this in 2006 was to make the penalty gradual, a microscopic amount per second, but the problem is that the cumulative time until the payment times out then tends to get so long that the timeout itself no longer serves to solve the ""reserve payment attack"", and while the penalty could be a sufficient solution *there was only a penalty on one of the phases*. So, people settled for ""staggered timeouts"" as a work around, but this does not fix the problem, network failures or denial of service attacks can still cause an innocent intermediary to end up paying for the full payment. The solution is to add the penalty on both phases. This is easily done once you realize that the *other* 2-phase commit, that finishes on timeout, also only has a penalty on one of the phases but it has it on the *opposite* phase. Thus, you can simply **combine** them and add a phase in between that shifts the action of the timeout, thus you get a 3-phase commit. I built Ryan Fugger's base layer already (just 2500 lines of code with zero dependencies) and adding ""collateral"" (""state proof"" on top of the ""base payment channel"") is very easy. Raiden could be built and finished with minimal work. If anyone is interested. My goal is already achieved with the base layer (as my vision only required it to exits) but I could help out with pointers if anyone wants to get a real Raiden created. I have more material, video presentation, complete implementation, etc, if anyone is interested. And I can walk anyone through it as well in chat for example here in discussion thread, the 3-phase commit is **very simple** it was just a bit hard to discover as people tend to follow the path already made by others (the cancel-on-timeout 2-phase commit, whereas I approached the other one and naturally noticed both together would *transcend* the limitations of either).

p_1oauyce,"Solana is the most undervalued asset in crypto and the market has not priced it correctly >**TL;DR:** Solana should realistically be worth between 1,000 and 3,000 per coin based on adoption, usage, and network economics. As of writing this, it trades under 200 and will likely fall lower during the coming market retrace. That will not be a crash. It will be the best asymmetric opportunity in crypto in the next 2 to 3 years. If you do not understand why yet, this post explains the fundamentals behind that valuation and why the current market still severely misprices Solana. Solana should already be worth 1,000 based on utility alone. That will sound dramatic to people who think in headlines rather than data, but the reality is simple. Price does not move first. Usage moves first. Price catches up. The Solana network has already entered the phase where reality is far ahead of its valuation. The repricing has not started yet. This is not a meme or a hype cycle pitch. Solana sits at the intersection of three truths. It has real users. It has real throughput. It has real developer activity. Crypto is finally maturing into an industry where capital follows usage. Usage follows scalability. Scalability drives liquidity. Liquidity drives market caps. Solana is ahead of everyone except Bitcoin and Ethereum, yet it is still priced like a high beta speculation token rather than what it actually is, which is a core piece of blockchain infrastructure. # What Solana actually is Solana is often mischaracterized as a faster version of Ethereum. That is incorrect and outdated thinking. Solana is a monolithic high performance execution layer. Ethereum is evolving into a modular settlement system that relies on external rollups and bridges. These differences are not cosmetic. They produce entirely different network behaviors and application capabilities. Ethereum will remain the preferred environment for high value settlement and institutional DeFi. Solana is built for scalable real time transactions and consumer level blockchain applications. It is the first chain to function like an actual financial engine rather than a slow L1 base layer. This is why activity on Solana looks nothing like a typical altcoin. The network actually runs. # Usage explains the mispricing Networks with real activity eventually dominate market cap rankings, but it does not happen instantly. For months, even years, there is a lag where usage metrics separate sharply from price. That is where Solana is now. Some relevant facts: * Solana is consistently one of the top blockchains in daily active users and frequently ranks #1 by real users when filtering out spam activity. * Transaction throughput and volume are sustained by real usage, including DeFi, trading, payments, and consumer apps. * Solana has one of the fastest growing developer ecosystems in crypto. * On-chain DEX volume regularly competes with and sometimes *exceeds* Ethereum, especially during high volatility periods. * Liquidity depth and market integration have been *increasing* month over month, with more institutional-grade market makers participating. * Solana has more active users than all major Ethereum L2s *combined* during most periods. * The current price still reflects outdated skepticism from the 2022 era, while on-chain metrics show network growth and adoption. # Common criticisms are outdated or wrong. The majority of pushback against Solana is based on narratives rather than facts. The three most common objections are easy to address. **Centralization** Solana has one of the largest validator sets in crypto and a high Nakamoto coefficient. It is more decentralized in practice than every rollup and sidechain that depends on a multisig or sequencer. It is decentralized enough for open global finance. Anything beyond that is philosophy. **Venture capital control** VC unlocks are already behind us. Distribution has decentralized through open markets. If VC presence was a problem, then nearly every large crypto project would also be invalid. **Outages** The network had performance failures during its early period. They were fixed. The improvements now include local fee markets, quality of service rules, and a second independent validator client from Jump Crypto called Firedancer. None of these arguments hold up. They only persist as talking points for people who stopped learning about Solana back in 2021. # Unified liquidity is a critical advantage Solana has a single shared state. All applications operate in one place. There is no fragmentation by design. Liquidity moves freely across the network. Ethereum is pursuing modular scaling through L2s and rollups which introduces risk, synchronization delays, fragmented liquidity, and user friction. The experience of bridging funds across multiple networks is not sustainable for mass adoption. Solana avoids this problem entirely. # Institutional flow will enter Solana Capital rotates in predictable patterns. Bitcoin first, Ethereum second, high conviction L1 third. That third position used to be a rotating story. Cardano, Polkadot, Avalanche all had their brief window. None developed real network effects. Solana did. It now has the liquidity depth and exchange integration required for institutional accumulation. Once the regulatory structure catches up, it will be added to portfolio models the same way Ethereum was in 2020. # Timeline and price logic Solana is not a 10 year hold to maybe see returns. It is a 2 to 3 year asymmetric play with a structural repricing window. If Solana captures a reasonable percentage of on-chain global transaction flow then a fair market value is * 1,000 at approximately 440 billion market cap * 2,000 at approximately 880 billion market cap * 3,000 at approximately 1.3 trillion market cap These numbers are realistic inside a 10 trillion total crypto market by 2027 or earlier. Network effects always look impossible until they become obvious. There was a time when people thought Ethereum would never reach a 500 billion market cap. That era is over. The same disbelief now sits in front of Solana. # The window will not stay open There will be a bear market before Solana reprices. That bear market will take Solana under current prices. That decline will cause retail holders to exit and panic. That event will not change the long term thesis. It will not impact the network. It will not reverse adoption. It will simply transfer supply from weak hands to strong ones. The correct strategy over the next 2 to 3 years is accumulation, not reaction. For me, that means steady purchasing and staking through Phantom. I am not trading Solana. I am building position weight and yield. Whether price goes down or up in the short term is irrelevant to the thesis. Solana has already won the application layer. Transactions, developers, liquidity, products, integrations, and user adoption all confirm this. The only area that has not yet moved is price. That will change during the next expansion cycle. Market disbelief will disappear. Analysts will begin publishing revised price targets. Institutions will include Solana in their allocation models. It will go from a high conviction play to a consensus trade. By that time, the entry window will be gone. Solana should already be worth 1,000. It will get there. The only question is who will hold it when it does. This is the most undervalued asset in crypto. The market has not priced it correctly.

p_1o7ug0v,"During The Crash, Solana Stayed Fast And Cheap. Ethereum Got Too Expensive To Use. Here's What That Actually Means When that $19 billion liquidation event hit last Friday, it basically turned into a real world stress test for every major blockchain. And it revealed something big about how Solana and Ethereum behave under pressure. Solana held up. Ethereum didnt. Lets look at the actual performance data. During peak chaos, Solana was processing around 1,200 to 1,300 transactions per second (TPS). Block finality stayed near 400 to 450 milliseconds, and while fees spiked briefly, they only went up to $0.20 to $0.30 per transaction before dropping back below a cent. The network stayed stable with no major slowdowns or congestion. Ethereum, on the other hand, was limited to roughly 13 to 15 TPS on the base layer (not 26). Block times extended to 14 to 15 seconds, and gas fees jumped above $500 per transaction at peak congestion, according to Etherscan data. That made the network effectively unusable for most people, transactions stalled, and many wallets and DeFi positions couldnt execute because users were priced out. As one treasury firm, DefDevCorp, put it: If your gas fees make the network inaccessible, its the same as being offline. In contrast, Solana stayed operational throughout, proving the recent upgrades to Firedancer, QUIC, and stake weighted QoS have strengthened network performance. Crypto researcher Aylo shared that during the crash, he could rebalance and move funds on Solana easily, while his Ethereum positions were frozen due to extreme gas costs. Thats a real world example of how Solanas architecture built for high throughput performs differently from Ethereums more conservative, security focused base layer. Ethereums scaling solutions (like Arbitrum and Base) help under normal conditions, but the mainnet still bottlenecks during global panic moments. And thats when Solana shines, not because its perfect, but because it was designed for speed from the ground up. This is more than just a one day win. Solanas had over 20 months of uptime since early 2023, a major improvement after its earlier reliability issues. Ethereums ecosystem is still much larger and more decentralized, but in raw throughput and stability under stress, Solanas catching serious attention. If these patterns continue, where Solana stays usable during chaos and Ethereum slows down, that could shift how institutions and DeFi protocols allocate capital. Traders and developers want reliability when the markets melting down, not just during quiet times. And thats exactly the mindset driving projects like Awaken, which are building directly on Solana to take advantage of its real-world performance edge. Because in moments when speed, cost, and uptime decide everything, being on the right foundation matters. Both chains have their strengths: Ethereums decentralization and history versus Solanas speed and cost efficiency. But this crash proved one thing clearly, when cryptos under pressure, Solanas network holds up better in real world performance tests.",2025-10-16 03:22:05,Gullible-Tale9114,post,solana,,Reddit,crash stay fast cheap expensive use actually mean billion event hit friday basically turn real world stress test major reveal big behave pressure hold didn let look actual performance datum peak chaos process transaction second tps block finality stay near millisecond fee spike briefly transaction drop cent network stay stable major slowdown congestion hand limit roughly tps base layer block extend second gas fee jump transaction peak congestion accord etherscan datum network effectively unusable transaction stall wallet position couldn execute user treasury firm defdevcorp gas fee network inaccessible offline contrast stay operational prove recent upgrade firedancer quic stake weight qos strengthen network performance researcher aylo share crash rebalance fund easily position freeze extreme gas cost real world example architecture build high throughput perform differently conservative security focus base layer scale solution like arbitrum base help normal condition mainnet bottleneck global panic moment shine perfect design speed ground win month uptime early major improvement early reliability issue ecosystem large decentralized raw throughput stability stress catch attention pattern continue stay usable chaos slow shift institution protocol allocate capital developer want reliability melt quiet exactly mindset drive project like awaken build directly advantage real world performance edge moment speed cost uptime decide right foundation matter chain strength decentralization history versus speed cost efficiency crash prove thing clearly pressure network hold real world performance test,0.144,0.657,0.2,0.891,positive,neutral

p_1nztv0l,"nasdaq-listed company just bought 2.2 million sol following microstrategy's playbook A Nasdaq listed company, Solana Company (formerly Helius Medical Technologies, ticker HSDT), announced it has accumulated over 2.2 million SOL tokens as part of its new corporate treasury strategy. At current prices around $232 to $235, the companys SOL holdings are worth approximately $525 million. Combined with its cash reserves, the total value of its assets now exceeds $530 million, surpassing the gross proceeds raised during its private placement in September. Cosmo Jiang from Pantera Capital, who serves as a board observer, compared their approach to Michael Saylors Bitcoin strategy at MicroStrategy and Tom Lees model at Bitmine. Jiang stated that the company is efficiently accumulating SOL to maximize shareholder value. CEO Joseph Chee added that institutional demand for Solana exposure has been stronger than expected, particularly after recent digital asset conferences in Asia. This indicates growing institutional interest in Solana as a treasury asset, not just from retail investors. Solana Company becomes one of the first publicly traded firms to hold SOL as a primary balance sheet asset, similar to how MicroStrategy uses Bitcoin and Bitmine uses Ethereum. When public companies hold crypto on their balance sheet, it creates consistent demand that is less tied to short term retail sentiment. 2.2 million SOL represents a substantial portion of circulating supply being locked by a single entity, reducing available liquidity in the market. If more public companies follow this model, it could create steady buying pressure similar to Bitcoins corporate treasury wave. Whether Solana Companys stock trades at a premium like MicroStrategys remains to be seen, but this move marks an important moment for corporate adoption of Solana as a treasury asset.",2025-10-06 21:09:15,Gullible-Tale9114,post,solana,,Reddit,nasdaq list company million follow microstrategy playbook nasdaq list company company helius medical technology ticker hsdt announce accumulate million new corporate treasury strategy current company holding worth approximately million combine cash reserve total value asset exceed million surpass gross proceed raise private placement september cosmo jiang pantera capital serve board observer compare approach michael saylor strategy microstrategy tom lee model bitmine jiang state company efficiently accumulate maximize shareholder value ceo joseph chee add institutional demand exposure strong expect particularly recent digital asset conference asia indicate grow institutional interest treasury asset retail company publicly firm hold primary balance sheet asset similar microstrategy use bitmine use public company hold balance sheet create consistent demand tie short term retail sentiment million represent substantial portion circulate supply lock single entity reduce available liquidity public company follow model create steady buying pressure similar corporate treasury wave company stock premium like microstrategy remain mark important moment corporate adoption treasury asset,0.045,0.707,0.248,0.984,positive,positive

p_1nyllvk,"Why is Solana's inflation rate actually close to 16% yoy? - Solanas Official Inflation vs. the Real, Lived Inflation Article from [cryptoinflation.eu]( : Most dashboards show a single inflation rate for Solana. That number isnt *wrong*it just describes **policy minting**, not the **growth of tradable (circulating) supply** that markets actually feel. In this article, we will take a look at theese two sides of the same coin and explain the differences. # 1) What the official inflation rate is Solanas protocol sets an **annual inflation parameter** and mints new SOL proportionally over time, distributing it to the staked set (validators + delegators). Conceptually: * `r_annual`  protocols annual inflation parameter (decimal, e.g., 0.07 for 7%) * `S_start`  total SOL supply at the start of a period * `?t`  length of the epoch (seconds) * `Y`  seconds per year (e.g., 31,536,000) **Exact time-proportional mint for one epoch** Mint_epoch = S_start * ( (1 + r_annual)^(?t / Y) - 1 ) Annualizing across many epochs reproduces the **official** or **policy inflation**. That figure answers: > **Important:** This is about **minted supply** by design. It does **not** attempt to measure the market float. [Solanas official inflation rate. Source: https:\/\/docs.anza.xyz\/implemented-proposals\/ed\_overview\/ed\_validation\_client\_economics\/ed\_vce\_state\_validation\_protocol\_based\_rewards]( # 2) Why policy minting ? what the market feels Two parallel ideas often get conflated: * **Monetary (total) supply inflation**  how much the **total** supply changes after accounting for burns and other adjustments. * **Circulating (float) inflation**  how much the **tradable/circulating** supply changes, which also depends on unlocks and treasury movements. The official number targets minting; **net supply** and **circulating** each add their own layers. # 3) Circulating (float) inflation (market view) Many readers care about the growth of **circulating** supplythe coins that can trade. Unlocks and treasury moves matter here. Let: * `Circ_T0`, `Circ_T1`  circulating supply at start/end * `Unlocks`  previously non-circulating SOL that entered circulation * `Relocks`  SOL that left circulation (vesting/escrow/treasury moves) * `Treasury_Moves`  any policy-relevant reclassifications affecting float (foundation spending, grants, etc.) Observed change: ?Circ_observed = Circ_T1 - Circ_T0 You can decompose it (optional, for clarity): ?Circ_observed = (Real_Issuance - Burns_effect_on_circulating) + Unlocks - Relocks + Treasury_Moves Then the float inflation rate: CircInfl_window = ?Circ_observed / Circ_T0 CircInfl_annualized = (1 + CircInfl_window)^( Seconds_per_year / Seconds_in_window ) - 1 **Key distinction:** Unlocks and treasury distributions **do not mint** new SOL; they change **who can sell it**, so they affect **circulating**, not **total** supply. [Market inflation rate from https:\/\/www.cryptoinflation.eu\/coin\/solana]( # 4) Reconciling the perspectives * **Official (policy) inflation**: what the protocol intends to mint per year. * **Circulating inflation**: how the tradable float changed after unlocks/treasury activity and burns. # Bottom line The **official Solana inflation rate isnt wrong**its just a **policy measure of minting**.

p_1nwewyn,"Is Solana set up better than ETH for a staking ETF TLDR. Bitwises CEO said at Token2049 that Solanas faster unstake process could make it easier to package for a staking ETF than Ethereum. The claim is about plumbing, not hype. Fund desks need smooth creations and redemptions. Shorter exit times and predictable staking flows make their jobs simpler. The SEC has updated rules for listing spot crypto ETFs. That can shorten timelines when products meet the requirements. In that world, clean operations matter more. This is one companys view, not an approval. What actually ships will depend on custody, staking setup, and risk controls. Timelines can still slip. If a Solana staking ETF lands, what must it include. Broad validator distribution. Clear fee disclosure. On chain reporting of stake moves. No reuse of customer assets without consent. What else would make you trust it. For holders considering staking strategies around potential ETF launches, tax treatment matters regardless of whether you're staking directly or through a fund. Staking rewards hit as income when received, then basis tracking on those rewards when you eventually sell. Been using awaken to handle this automatically since manually logging daily staking drops and their USD values at receipt time isn't realistic at scale.

p_1o96q09,"JupiterExchange Unveils ""Ultra V3"", The Most Advanced End To End Trading Engine Ever Created **Source:** [ >**Introducing Ultra V3  the most advanced end to end trading engine ever created.** It delivers what traders want most: **- Best Price:** Meta aggregation which includes Iris, our new router **- Best Execution:** ShadowLane for optimal private txn landing & Predictive Execution for best-in-class execution **- Best Protection:** Sandwich protection & advanced slippage estimation And it drives real results: \- 34x better sandwich protection \- Industry-leading performance (+0.6 bps positive slippage vs. -1bps to -14bps negative slippage from other platforms over a 7-day vol-weighted analysis) \- 8-10x lower execution fees Ultra v3 is seamlessly integrated across all Jupiter products, including Mobile, Web, Desktop, our API, and Pro Tools. Thats not all  it also has enhanced Gasless Support, Ultra Signaling, JIT market revivals, and more ?? >**Meta Aggregation with the New Iris Router (Exclusive to Ultra)** Ultra uses meta aggregation between Iris, JupiterZ, DFlow, Hashflow, and OKX to find you the best pricing from various routers. Iris, only available on Ultra, is our new router after sunsetting Metis. Iris allows better splitting (up to 0.01%) and utilizes better routing algorithms like Golden-section and Brents method. We are seeing 100x performance improvements with the new routing algorithms. JupiterZ is our own RFQ system, which facilitates \~$100M daily volume with zero slippage  exclusively available via Ultra v3. With these, you get the best price possible, every time. >**Predictive Execution: Smart Route Prioritization For Superior Execution** Optimized for execution and slippage  not quote-optimized illusions. Most platforms catfish you with prices that dont reflect the on-chain reality, or worse yet, mislead you into thinking they are showing the best price from Jupiter. Predictive Execution goes beyond just simulating routes. It accurately predicts potential slippage, intelligently prioritizes routes, and ultimately gives you the best possible outcome and price at the point of execution, not just at the point of quotation. On top of that, Predictive Execution performs just in-time simulations for every route, uses signaling to help Prop AMMs to quote tighter for non-toxic flow versus toxic flow  allowing Jupiter Ultra users to get better pricing. With this, quotes reflect actual likely on-chain execution, not theoretical best-case scenarios. No inflated best prices or tricks to delude. Predictive Execution also includes RTSE, the most advanced slippage estimator in DeFi, worked on for over 2 years. What you see is what you get. Every swap lands exactly as promised. Executed in the best way possible, at the best price, every time. >**Ultra Signaling: Even better pricing for Ultra Users** Prop AMMs are a big deal recently because they can quote very tightly on-chain for users. But they have to play defense with toxic traders like arb bots, toxic takers, etc. So, when quoting on-chain, they have to be careful to not quote too tightly (better price) to prevent being abused by these toxic traders. Ultra Signaling is built directly on-chain on our Jupiter Aggregator contract to detect non-toxic flow on-chain. One of the Prop AMMs we are working with is now quoting 3 bps tighter (50% better) for our Ultra users with this signal. >**ShadowLane  Elite In-House Transaction Landing Engine** Our entirely brand new in-house transaction landing engine, ShadowLane, is built for sub-second precision and for incredible real-time data, as well as execution. \- Private by design  no external relays, no order-flow sales. \- 3x more trades landed than alternative premium methods. \- Landing latency reduced  down from 13 blocks (400ms1.2s) to 01 block (50400ms). Massive effort from our newly formed RPC team led by [@italoacasas]( with contributors to Yellowstone-gRPC, NFT DAS API, Lite-RPC, Agave, and more. There will be so much more coming from this elite team, with work that will directly benefit the broader Solana ecosystem, stay tuned! >**Best-in-Class MEV Protection  34x Better Than Top Trading Terminals** Other providers increase your risk of being sandwiched by selling your order flow to third-party MEV searchers. Ultra v3 does the opposite  it minimizes your exposure to toxic MEV by ensuring your trades are never handed off to any external provider for on-chain execution. And while the risk isnt zero (since validators still broadcast to the chains leaders), Ultra brings it as close to zero as possible. Safe. Private. Built Differently. >**RTSE  Real-Time Slippage Estimator** Knowing what slippage to set is always very difficult given volatile tokens, stablecoins, big caps, and different execution scenarios. This is a challenge not just for new DeFi users, but for experienced traders as well. RTSE is our ongoing effort to solve this problem & uses important data points such as volume and transactions to improve outcomes. For v3 we have made a number of major changes, including: \- Reduced RTSE slippage set while maintaining high success rates \- Automatic prioritization of slippage-protected routes over purely price-optimized routes \- Increased volatility sensitivity for tokens with high historical volatility patterns For volatile tokens in particular, Ultras RTSE tightens the acceptable price range just enough to allow your swap to go through without overpaying for slippage. >**Enhanced Gasless Support** Gasless Support, our just-in-time fee payer, allows you to trade without needing to hold SOL for gas fees. So long as one token has a qualifying value during a trade, Ultra will compute the gas from your transaction, and pay for it with your swap. And now in v3 we have enhanced our Gasless Support, including expanded support (Token-2022 and memecoin-memecoin pairs), as well as lower minimum trade size (\~$10). Now everyone with any asset in their wallet can make a trade. >**Just-In-Time Market Revival** Ultra v3 achieves what other legacy routers cannot. It routes every token on Solana  even the dead and forgotten ones. \- No minimum liquidity threshold \- Supports old, inactive markets \- Dynamically re-indexes on demand Close old positions, dump forgotten bags, trade everything. Complete coverage of the entire Solana ecosystem  exclusively on Ultra. >**Use Natively Across Web, Mobile & Desktop Wallet** Jupiter has 3 world class surfaces that our users love: \- **Web:** our full suite of Jupiter products including Portfolio, Swap, Pro, Perps, Lend, and more - giving you the most comprehensive DeFi experience and tools with best-in-class execution + protection, lowest fees, and smoothest design and UX \- **Jupiter Mobile:** 10x cheaper, 10x faster, 10x sexier  the best mobile trading experience (including native portfolio in a wallet and the sleekest UX), full PnL analysis, and easiest way to send and receive tokens or onboard anyone with just a link or QR \- **Jupiter Wallet for Desktop:** the most advanced Solana wallet as a desktop browser extension with gasless trading, deep integration with Jupiter products, PnL analysis, 10x lower fees than any other wallet - and synced with your Mobile wallet Ultra v3 powers all these interfaces: Seamless. Consistent. Advanced.

We are also rolling out the Ultra API to allow our partners to utilize the best-in-class routing/transaction landing infra behind Ultra v3. Currently, many meta routers and many others are still using our sunsetted Jupiter Legacy API (Metis). We will be working with them to upgrade their routing to adopt the new Ultra API. If you are using Jupiter Legacy API in your app, please correctly label to avoid misleading your users that this is the best price from Jupiter. In particular, certain apps are using the free binary, which is deprecated and we have no control over the results, and it is very discouraging to see certain platforms abuse something that we have offered to the ecosystem for free for years. >**Ultra v3 Is Built for YOU.** **Use easily:** Zero config or adjustments needed for the best execution. **Use without worries:** Lowest fees possible, best protection, best-in-class transaction landing, unmatched customer service. **Use seamlessly:** Alongside our other world-class Pro tools like Terminal, Screener, Analytics. **Use natively:** Available on Mobile, Web, API, and Desktop.

p_1nu5xne,"SEC Issues Rare No-Action Letter to DoubleZero: 2Z Tokens for Network Contributors Aren't Securities  A Huge Step for Crypto Clarity! Big news out of the SEC today that's got me genuinely excited for once  they've issued a No-Action Letter to the DoubleZero Foundation for their 2Z token, marking the first such relief for a crypto project in about 5 years. This isn't just a win for DoubleZero; it's a green light for DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) projects everywhere, clarifying that rewarding people for actual work on a blockchain network doesn't automatically make tokens ""securities."" * What's DoubleZero? It's a decentralized network built to optimize internet connectivity for high-performance stuff like blockchains. Think: a marketplace where people contribute underutilized fiber optic links (Network Providers) or handle maintenance/monitoring (Resource Providers) to boost bandwidth and reduce latency. The 2Z token powers payments, incentives, and security on this network. * The SEC's Take: After four months of back-and-forth, the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance reviewed how 2Z gets distributed ""programmatically"" (i.e., automatically as rewards for contributions). Their conclusion? No enforcement action needed because these aren't investment contracts under the Howey Test. Why? Contributors earn 2Z based on their own efforts  running nodes, providing storage, or sharing bandwidth  not from some promoter's managerial magic. Key quote from the letter:The person who runs a node, provides storage, or shares bandwidth earns a reward. These tokens are neither shares of stock in a company, nor promises of profits.In plain English: If you're actually building or maintaining the network, your token rewards are tied to utility, not speculation. No registration required under the Securities Act, and 2Z doesn't count as equity securities. * Why This Matters: * For Builders: Ends the regulatory fog around token incentives. Projects can launch compliant token models in the US without fearing a Gensler-style smackdown. * For DePIN: Validates models like Filecoin or Helium, where tokens reward real-world resources (bandwidth, storage) rather than ""passive investment returns."" * Broader Crypto Vibes: Signals a potential thaw in SEC-crypto relations.

Hey everyone  Im experimenting with a small Python/Rust prototype to better understand Solana transaction flows. The idea is to:  Stream wallet transactions in real time (RPC/WebSocket or other approaches)  Tag / cluster wallets by repeated behavior (deployers, active traders, whales, etc.)  Store this data cleanly so I can later backtest and build filters for patterns  Eventually connect this into MEV research  but with a focus on protective / ethical strategies (e.g., avoiding harmful sandwiching, exploring fair-ordering concepts, and looking at how validators/searchers handle flow on Solana). A couple of questions Im running into: 1. For low latency streaming, are people here leaning on Solana Web3.js, Rust SDK, or direct RPC subscriptions? 2. How do you handle missed events if a websocket connection drops? 3. Any tips on efficiently labeling wallets without ballooning storage/compute? 4.

p_1nx6mya,"Solana inflation and emission Hello guys, have you ever wondered what is the inflation rate and emission of your favourite cryptocurrency? If youre into Solana, the answer isnt staticit follows a **decaying issuance schedule** and interacts with **staking** and **network fees**. We built [**cryptoinflation.eu**]( to make SOLs supply dynamics easy to explain and compare with other chains. On our Solana page youll find: * **Current annualized issuance** (protocol inflation) and how it has been **declining over time** toward a long-run rate. * **Historical curve & epoch views** so you can see the step-down of inflation and the effect of validator set changes. * **Net supply change** that factors in fee effects and any burns, giving you a cleaner picture of real dilution for holders. * **Staking context**: rewards come from inflation and fees; validator commission and stake distribution shape *yields*, while issuance shapes *dilution*. * **Comparisons** with PoW and other PoS networks to show how Solanas decaying schedule differs from fixed or variable models. Why it matters: the same market cap can hide very different dilution paths. Clear charts + plain-English notes help you discuss epochs, priority fees, and staking economics without spreadsheets. Wed love feedback from Solana validators, builders, and educators: which extra metrics (e.g., effective inflation after fees, stake concentration overlays, MEV/priority-fee views) would make this most useful for dashboards, talks, or meetup slides? **Link:** [ [Solana inflation and emission over the past 3 years](",2025-10-03 19:10:03,Adorable-Platypus-46,post,solana,,Reddit,inflation emission hello guy wonder inflation rate emission favourite answer isn static follow decay issuance schedule interact staking network fee build cryptoinflation supply dynamic easy explain compare chain page find current annualize issuance protocol inflation decline long run rate historical curve epoch view step inflation effect validator set change net supply change factor fee effect burn clean picture real dilution holder stake context reward come inflation fee validator commission stake distribution shape yield issuance shape dilution comparison pow pos network decay schedule differ fixed variable model matter cap hide different dilution path clear chart plain english note help discuss epoch priority fee stake economic spreadsheet love feedback validator builder educator extra metric effective inflation fee stake concentration overlay mev priority fee view useful dashboard talk meetup slide link inflation emission past,0.046,0.768,0.186,0.9657,positive,neutral

p_1oavwdf,"Uptober and its seasonal probability Lets cut through the Uptober hype with some cold, hard data. Youve got a chart of Bitcoin monthly returns and youre eyeing October. From 2013 to 2024, October closed green 10/12 times (only 2014 and 2018 were red). If this month Oct-2025 closes red, thats 3/13 about 23% odds of a down month. Nice edge, sure, but not destiny. The seasonal probability 70/30: In traditional markets, many calendar effects win around 60-70% of the time over long samples, good, but far from guaranteed. Two well studied examples: the Halloween indicator (Sell in May) shows higher Nov-Apr returns across many markets, but not every year, updated research still finds persistence, not certainty. Likewise, the turn of the month effect concentrates a big chunk of average monthly return into a few days, yet it also fails regularly. In short, seasonality is probabilistic, think 70/30, not 100/0. Reality check: markets dont care about calendars, they care about cycles, liquidity, and macro. If were in a prolonged consolidation (post-halving churn, shifting policy), that \~23% downside month isnt some anomaly, its the cost of playing a probabilistic edge. The log trend can stay intact while October still prints red. Bottom line: Use seasonality as context, not a trigger. Based on my risk metric, BTC $109K = risk 48. It's still under 50 and today is Sunday. I'm DCAing in, sticking to my plan.

p_1oatdot,"Red letter day for crypto in UK tomorrow Finally the long overdue day arrives tomorrow when general brokerage accounts (of at least a few brokers) will provide access to bitcoin and ethereum backed etps and allow a safe tradfi route for those who were so far too much on the fence. Not only does this open the route to tax wrappers (sipp / isa) but also provides one of the safest ways to gain exposure if you didn't want to go down the 'control your own keys' route. I know that at least 21shares and Wisdomtree btc and eth etps are set to be opened for trading to Retail tomorrow with the rest soon following within days. To start with, access will be provided by Interactive Investors, Trading212 and Saxobank with others likely to follow in due course. While there has been concern that these products are etns rather than US style etfs, such risks are largely overblown as the products are nonetheless fully backed The reason for Europe and UK using this structure is down to UCITS regulation not allowing etfs with single or concentrated asset underlyings. Edit 20/10: Can confirm that I tried in Interactive Investor this morning 20/10 and orders in CBTC were going through. T212 strangely gave me a message saying my 24 hour cooling off period was still underway and that i would be able to trade after 30/10. Edit: T212 now works for me and access to crypto etps is working! Edit: II is also providing access to Bitwise issued etps on LSE. Of particular note here is ticker ET33. This is far and away the most compelling staked Ethereum etp. Charges 0.65% pa fee and gives you all the staking yield minus 10% staking fee. It's benchmarked to an external Ethereum Total Return Index Don't be confused. ET33 is just the GBP ticker of the above. Edit: Another BTC etp worth looking into. Ticker BTC3 (Bitwise Core Bitcoin etp) Fee: 0.05% until 31/3/2026 and then reverting to 0.2% Edit: And finally Blackrock joining the party too with IB1T (note this is not the US IBIT). It's an etp like all others in UK. 0.15% to start with and reverting to 0.25% later. Somewhat higher fees but might appeal to anyone paranoid about issuer default risk. Edit 21/10: Apparently 21shares has announced that the fee on CBTC is now a permanent low of 0.1% pa (earlier it was supposed to revert to 0.21% after an year).

Toolapalooza Toolapalooza is a day-long developer event hosted by Turbin3, happening on October 18, 2025. The event brings together maintainers and experts behind key Solana developer tools for a series of focused workshops. Each session follows a 5W-How format, walking through what the tool is, why it matters, who uses it, where and when it fits into development, and how to use it effectively. The goal is to give developers a clear, practical understanding of Solanas core tools straight from the people who build and maintain them. Toolapalooza will have sessions on tools including: * MagicBlock * Switchboard * Vixen * LiteSVM * Surfpool * Carbon * Codama * Gill SDK Toolapalooza is structured to make learning hands-on so participants can see how tools connect within the Solana developer experience. The event is free and will be livestreamed on YouTube. [**Toolapalooza**]( # ?? SBPF Linker A big change for Solana developers has arrived with SBPF Linker built by Blueshift. Until now, building programs on Solana required a custom Rust toolchain and Solana-specific build commands such as `build-sbf`. This approach relied on a forked version of Rust and LLVM that maintained Solanas BPF target separately from the official open-source repos. This creates challenges for developers like nonstandard workflows, compatibility issues when updating toolchains, and extra setup steps for those already familiar with Rust. The new SBPF Linker changes that. It acts as an upstream BPF linker that can take standard BPF binaries compiled with nightly Rust and relink them into a format compatible with Solanas SBPF v0 runtime. This means developers can now use the standard Rust compiler and ecosystem tools without switching toolchains or learning new commands. Solana programs can be built with regular Rust tooling while remaining fully compatible with the Solana blockchain. By removing the need for a custom toolchain, the process of building and maintaining Solana programs becomes simpler, faster, and more in line with conventional Rust development practices. [**SBPF Linker Annoucement**]( # ?? GitFish v2 GitFish v2 offers a new way to fund open source projects through tokenized backing. Each GitHub repo is represented by a single coin, and anyone can launch a coin for a project they believe in. Launching costs a set number of points based on a projects popularity, measured by GitHub stars. Coins generate value through attention and trading fees, creating a funding stream for verified project maintainers. Maintainers can link their GitHub accounts to claim earnings and reinvest in their projects. Launching is free for project owners, while other users pay in points and earn 0.1% of trading fees for coins they create. Points are earned by interacting on GitFish through trading, tipping, or completing quests. By connecting GitHub activity to Solanas blockchain economy, GitFishs goal is to create a new way for open source projects to receive ongoing support to maintain their project's development. [**GitFish**]( # ?? LiteSVM Docs LiteSVM has a new documentation site designed to help Solana developers learn how to easily test and debug onchain programs using LiteSVM. The site includes detailed guides, usage examples, and links to example repos that integrate LiteSVM into Anchor-based projects. LiteSVM is a lightweight library for testing Solana programs that runs an in-process Solana Virtual Machine optimized for developers. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on external validator processes, LiteSVM embeds the VM directly into test environments, allowing tests to run faster with flexible configuration options for advanced use cases. The new documentation site centralizes resources and examples to help developers quickly integrate LiteSVM into their workflow, improving both the speed and reliability of Solana program testing.

p_1o98dlz,"SolanaFloor - What Does Solana Seeker's New Activity Tracker Mean For A Potential SKR Airdrop? **Source:** [ # How to track your Seeker activity and why it might be worth doing something every day ?? [@solace\_fm]( On top of the wealth of boosts and rewards delivered so far in Seeker Season, Solana Mobile has dropped yet another curious Easter Egg. A recently unveiled tab in the Seed Vault Wallet enables users to track their participation in the Seeker ecosystem, hinting at future rewards for more engaged participants. How can you turn on Seeker activity tracking, what counts towards measuring participation, and why should you care? # Why Might Solana Mobile Want to Measure Your Activity? Think back to May 2025, when Solana Mobile GM Emmett Hollyer [took the stage at Solana Accelerate]( and unveiled the vision for a fully decentralized, economic flywheel. Powered by [$SKR]( the Seeker economy is engineered to reward developers and contributors, while empowering token holders to govern the direction of one of cryptos most ambitious experiments. The announcement of [$SKR]( stoked wildfire speculation across the crypto world. Having waited over a year since presales for the mysterious Chapter Two device opened, prospective Seeker owners dared to dream that Solana Mobile might kickstart yet another wave of airdrops for those seeking to disrupt the mobile duopoly. But if Solana Mobile is actually going to reward Seeker users, there needs to be a fair and equitable way of ensuring that genuine, organic activity takes precedence. This is where Seeker Activity Tracking comes into play, and before the privacy maxis amongst you raise your hands in anger, take a second and think about how this might be beneficial to you. # How to Turn On Seeker Activity Tracking The Seed Vault Wallet app has recently implemented a critical new feature. Aptly named Seeker Activity Tracking, this new tool helps users track their participation and involvement in the Seeker ecosystem. If you havent already been using Seeker every day, consider this your chance to actively manage your involvement and build rituals and routines that enhance your Seeker experience. To enable Seeker Activity Tracking, visit Settings and flip Usage and Diagnostics to the right. You should be able to access the revamped activity tab in the Seed Vault Wallet app (found in the bottom right corner of the UI. Within the Activity tab, users can track the frequency and depth of their engagement across the Seeker Ecosystem. Activity tracking began in the week of September 29, so dont worry if you didnt receive your Seeker in the weeks immediately following shipping. # Maximize Your Activity Every wallets onchain activity is ranked across 5 levels of a tiered system. Naturally, the more you trade, stake, and interact with the Solana network, the further you advance through the 5 levels. Seeker Activity Tracking breaks down user behaviour into three categories: Onchain, Daily Use, and dApp activity. **Onchain Activity -** As one could expect, onchain activity covers pretty much anything that involves transacting across the Solana network. This includes, but is not limited to, trading tokens, staking [$SOL]( to a validator, minting NFTs and interacting with onchain applications. (Maybe) Alpha Tip: While remaining a passive activity, staking [$SOL]( seems to qualify for daily participation in the Seeker Ecosystem. While I will openly admit I havent fired off transactions every single day, my own onchain activity heatmap still shows ongoing activity. This could come from supporting the Seeker Validator. **Daily Use -** Solana Seekers daily activity tracker is a bit more vague. According to the Seed Vault Wallets UI, Daily Use monitors how deeply the Seeker is intertwined with your standard routines. Daily Use tracks how you use Seeker, and seems to be encouraging users to integrate the device into the life outside of crypto, building a streak of organic behaviour. Seeker has been designed as a mobile-first crypto device, but that doesnt inherently mean it should only be used for crypto-related activities. **dApps -** The Solana dApp Store now boasts over 150 unique and exclusive applications, with more being added every day. Dozens are constantly being developed through recurring hackathons, and the quality of apps on offer only improves as competition to win the favor of 150,000 authentic, verifiably high-quality Seeker users grows more fierce. Seekers dApp activity tracker measures how often users are exploring the Solana dApp Store and trying out applications. The official messaging in the Seed Vault Wallet encourages users to continue experimenting with both new apps and their existing favourites, so dont be psyoped into neglecting OG applications in favor of shiny new ones. # SKR is Coming Its no secret that the most active Seeker users could find themselves on the receiving end of some kinds of rewards in the future, like a potential SKR airdrop. Points programs and other incentivized campaigns typically result in exclusive benefits for users, and participating in the Seeker ecosystem is likely to be no different. Solana Mobile has asserted that SKR is coming, and ecosystem participation is essential to making Seeker the most rewarding experience possible. However, Seeker users shouldnt see this as a call to start maxxing out wash-trading accounts. The Seeker Activity Tracker clearly puts users on a more exploratory path, highlighting organic, curiosity-driven participation over mindless onchain activity. Instead, enjoy using Seeker for its intended purpose. Contribute to building and proliferating the worlds largest decentralized mobile stack, and support and encourage creative applications within the Solana dApp Store.

Audit Subsidy Program Areta is launching a new $1M Solana Audit Subsidy program to help Solana developers secure their projects by making professional audits more accessible to teams of all sizes. The subsidy pool is sponsored by leading audit firms active within the Solana space and an independent board composed of ecosystem leaders will review applications to make sure funds are directed toward the most promising builders. Applications to the program are open year-round and operate on a monthly cohort basis. Submissions close on the 7th of each month, with feedback provided by the 14th. Teams accepted into the Colosseum Accelerator program will be fast-tracked for approval within the program, helping them access audit funding and reviews more efficiently. The Audit Subsidy Program is a community-driven effort to provide affordable, high-quality security audits to Solana builders. [**The Solana Audit Subsidy Program**]( # ?? LearnSol Educational Content LearnSol has launched as a free, open-source curriculum designed to help developers learn Solana development by providing step-by-step guidance, practice tools, and project-based learning. Features include guided tutorials covering Solana, Rust, Anchor, and client-side development, an AI chat that explains concepts, and gamified learning through interactive challenges. Developers can build and deploy real applications such as token mints, NFT marketplaces, and escrow contracts with a single click, while challenges like 30 Days of Rust encourage consistent learning. This early release is part of a work-in-progress, with additional educational content and modules planned as the curriculum expands. [**LearnSol**]( # ?? Umbra ICO Privacy project Umbra, who received an Honorable Mention in the Colosseum Breakout Hackathon, launched its initial coin offering (ICO) on Solana this week, raising $154.9 million, more than 20,000% of its $750,000 minimum target. The team refunded the majority of those raised funds up to the cap of $3M. The key to this launch was the infrastructure that powered it, an Unruggable ICO futarchy launchpad powered by MetaDAO, a Colosseum portco, which uses markets rather than token-based voting to guide decisions, as well as provide ownership rights to token investors. The sale marks one of the first large-scale tests of futarchy applied to crypto fundraising, signaling growing interest in market-driven coordination models on Solana. [**Umbra ICO**]( # ????? Cyfrin Jobs Board Cyfrin just launched Cyfrin Jobs, a blockchain-native job board built to connect top onchain organizations with vetted developers. Cyfrin Jobs highlights your real onchain experience by automatically building your profile from verified activity across the Cyfrin ecosystem. It pulls in Updraft certifications, CodeHawks competition results, and Solodit security findings to showcase your skills, achievements, and hands-on project work For teams, the platform filters out noise with verified candidates, AI-assisted matching, and integration with recruiting tools. Some early partners hiring through the platform include Solana, Helius, Uniswap, and Monad and RedStone. Developers get a dynamic profile that updates as they earn certifications or complete competitions, plus access to a Telegram channel highlighting new roles. [**Introducing Cyfrin Jobs: Blockchain Native Recruitment**]( # ?? Open Audio Protocol Audius has launched v1.0 of the Open Audio Protocol, a major step toward decentralizing the music industry. The update introduces Artist Coins, a new Solana-based system that lets artists and fans directly participate in the value they create. Built in partnership with Solana, Meteora, Jupiter, and Metaplex, Artist Coins form the foundation of the Open Audio Protocol. Each coin launches on a bonding curve paired with $AUDIO, with trading fees flowing back into a community treasury. Artists can drop coins to fans, run campaigns, and launch bounties or activations, while fans gain a way to support and invest in creators they believe in. The 1.0 release also rebrands the Audius protocol itself as the Open Audio Protocol, reflecting its evolution from a single music app to a full, open infrastructure layer for global music distribution. Audius has now powered nearly 400 million music streams across apps built on its catalog. With this launch, it aims to redefine how artists control their distribution and how fans engage with the music economy [**Introducing The Open Audio Protocol**]( # ??

Listen to This **Solana Weekly** This weeks episode features Gaius, CEO of The Vault and founder of The Library, one of Solanas longest-running builder communities, who shares his path from traditional finance into crypto, why he focuses on infrastructure instead of speculation, and how builders can sustain progress through volatile markets. Much of the conversation focused on developer culture as Solanas competitive advantage. The people who build on nights and weekends for the sake of creation, he said, cant be outworked. The challenge now is maintaining that motivation as early builders find success. The discussion traces the evolution of Solanas community, from speculative hype to sustainable development, and what it takes to endure market cycles without losing focus.

p_1o0xq8p,"The Unique Trajectory and Core Strengths of Solana # The Unique Trajectory and Core Strengths of Solana Solana is truly unique in the blockchain world. I've never seen a network quite like it. It has been plagued by incidents and accidentsmultiple periods of downtime remain a significant investment risk, and unexpected events like the FTX collapse and the broader crypto winter have tested it repeatedly. Yet, Solana has miraculously revived, its ecosystem has persisted, and developers haven't abandoned it. Projects like **Backpack**, **Helius**, and **Jupiter** are, in my opinion, essentially NFTs in their very essence. I believe xNFTs will be used in incredibly diverse ways in the near future. With the recent launch of Sora2, I have a very strong feeling that sophisticated textures created by artists using these tools will be xNFT-ified. Solana already possesses peerless developers and the infrastructure to transform content into cultural value, and I see this as a huge differentiator. It's natural for a robust society to have sites associated with speculation and gambling, just as a huge country like the US has Las Vegas. This space is, after all, a society where people congregate. Blockchain, in my view, is set to become a fundamental piece of everyday infrastructure, not just a tool for RWA or asset tokenization. Four years from now, the situation could be drastically different from today. # Institutional Adoption and ETF Dynamics It's true that the introduction of an **ETF** would be highly favorable for Solana. The number of DA (Digital Asset) companies is slowly growing. Whereas Solana was previously bought and sold mostly by individuals, institutions and various corporations will now be buying it, which, theoretically, should positively impact the price. Moreover, being listed on a major exchange like Nasdaq signifies that Solana has been internationally recognized as a legitimate asset. However, what happens if the Solana network experiences another downtime or a major security issue? We don't need to compete with Ethereum; Solana must compete with itself. I don't feel the need to get into the ambiguous wordplay of whether Solana is a Layer 1 or a Layer 2. What's clear is that beyond simple transfers of money, Layer 2s aren't being used for much else. I also never want to experience the frustration of exorbitant gas fees and the sluggishness of the Ethereum network again. There were people who waited two months just to unstake their assets. # The Path to a More Robust Solana Solana is currently undergoing a complete overhaul of its legacy Proof-of-History (PoH) mechanism. The plan, which is currently being tested and executed, is to off-chain all accumulated data from the consensus process, separate the heavy data transfer network, and optimize simplicity by dividing the roles of block builders and proposers. Furthermore, an independent client, **Firedancer**, is slowly reaching completion, alongside existing clients like Agave and Jito-Solana. Having an additional independent client is a crucial undertaking that will significantly boost network security. I believe that once the trinity of **AlpenGlow, Firedancer, and the BAM project** is a stable full-stack reality, Solana will earn true respect. This meticulous, step-by-step progressmaking Solana safer, gaining external recognition, and fostering better user experiencemay be even more critical than an ETF. An ETF doesn't guarantee a positive outcome. Nasdaq is an arena of fierce competition where even a minor slip can lead to total disappearance. We must remember that even Ethereum's ETF launch last year coincided with a price drop. We also can't forget that institutions are the first to execute arbitrage on futures exchanges. The fact that the futures market is currently 12-20 times larger than the spot market is also a burden for long-term holders. While the SEC's fast-track process has been established, the current government shutdown adds uncertainty to the Solana ETF timeline. Nevertheless, considering its listing on futures exchanges for over six months, I cautiously predict that a listing is likely, even if the timing is delayed. I acknowledge the current headwinds, such as inflation and the FTX unlock sales, but I believe the market is absorbing them more quickly than expected. There is also ongoing debate about Solana's centralization, so why is its **Nakamoto Coefficient** so high? Perhaps we are all simply missing the invisible pieces of the puzzle. That may include me as well. But I believe in Solana, and I believe in all the constituents of the Solana ecosystem. There's an old saying: ""Buy what you know."" I believe the future Solana will be far more robust than it is today. I've been buying Solana within my means, even with the recent price surges. I'm a small, individual investor, but I plan to continue buying whenever the price dips. # P.S. Regarding Solana ETPs **P.S.** On a related note, the Assets Under Management (AUM) for the two European Solana ETPsthe **21Shares Solana Staking ETP (ASOL, SIX)** and the **CoinShares Physical Staked Solana (SLNC, Xetra/Swiss)**are quite substantial. || || |ETP Ticker (Exchange)|Issuer|Approximate AUM (USD/EUR)|Feature| |**ASOL (SIX)**|21Shares|?$1.34?1.39 Billion (or Billion)|**Staking Yields**Physically-backed, | |**SLNC (Xetra/SIX)**|CoinShares|?$633?539 Million (or Million)|**Staking Rewards (0% Fee)**Physically-backed, | Could this high AUM be due to the inclusion of **staking** rewards?

p_1o0hk8w,"What does the future of DeFI on Solana look like to you? Anyone else watch OpenAI's DevDay presentation today? They revealed the new AgentKit Agent Builder with the goal of improving the automation of workflows. It got me thinking about the trajectory DeFi is growing at. I believe the future is clear, especially after today: DeFi's Scaling **Fast**. Humans **Can't Keep Up**. Let's break it down. Solana DeFi just hit $13 billion in TVL for the first time. Six protocols crossed the billion-dollar mark (SolanaFloor)  Jito at $2B, Kamino at $1.61B doing lending. Jupiter processed over a trillion dollars in lifetime volume and captures 90%+ of aggregator activity (@21shares\_us). The infrastructure is actually working. But here's the reality: only 5-10% of crypto users are actively using their holdings (@rimeissner - Safe co-founder). 62% of crypto users now juggle at least two different wallets, up from 46% a year ago. You see the protocol alerts, you read about liquidations when people can't track exposure across platforms. Millions of dollars get lost to liquidations every day in DeFi - not because people are reckless, but because liquidation risk is somewhat invisible (@jrdothoughts) when you're managing positions across multiple protocols. Your SOL staked with your favorite validator, USDC earning yield on Kamino, perps open on Drift, liquidity in Meteora, swaps routing through Jupiter - you know each position individually. Your total exposure? Your aggregate liquidation threshold across everything? Mental math across several interfaces. I am working on something. It's an intelligent command center. One place where you see all your positions across Jupiter, Drift, Kamino, Meteora, Orca, Raydium, DFlow - everything. You get analytics on the full picture: lending, borrowing, your vaults, strategies, every spot and perps position. Your agents do the heavy lifting. They monitor risk profiles around the clock, surface opportunities, execute when conditions hit. You stay in control. Automate what you trust, approve what you don't. Ask for a summary of your exposure, get insights on where your capital's working hardest, automate rebalancing when allocations drift. An all-encompassing perspective with intelligent, agent-driven action. Visibility doesn't solve it. You need monitoring, alerts, insights, and executionacross everything. A system that knows when you're about to get liquidated, spots better yield opportunities before you do, flags portfolio drift, surfaces arbitrage, and acts when your conditions hit. Not another dashboard showing static positions, but active intelligence working 24/7. When 50% of DeFi liquidity is fragmented across chains and you're managing positions across multiple protocols, you need something that understands your full strategy, watches every protocol, catches every opportunity, and executes on your behalf. Manual monitoring doesn't scale when markets move this fast. Solana TVL doubled in a year. Jupiter processes $700M+ in daily swaps. The activity is compounding. The way I see it, an automated assustant is the ony way you can actually harness it - see everything, understand everything, act on everything - without drowning in interfaces or missing the move because you were checking a different protocol.

Its currently one of the top cryptocurrencies, usually appearing right after Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of market capitalization and hype. Id like to understand why it has gained such a high ranking. Is it primarily due to its technological advantages, like high transaction speed and scalability? Or is it more about developer adoption, ecosystem growth, or investor interest? Solana is known for its Proof-of-History + Proof-of-Stake consensus, which allows it to process thousands of transactions per second with very low fees. But beyond these technical details, what are the real-world factors that have propelled it to such a prominent position? Especially when Solana is not as decentralized as ETH or BTC. There are very few validators on the solana chain as compared to ETH. Id love to hear insights from people who follow the crypto market closely. What do you think makes Solana stand out compared to other blockchain projects? Are there risks or challenges that might affect its future ranking?

Cypherpunk Hackathon The Solana [Cypherpunk Hackathon]( will take place from September 25 through October 30, 2025. [ The event offers developers the opportunity to compete for prizes, pre-seed funding, and potential entry into Colosseums accelerator program. More than 2.5 million dollars in capital will be deployed to selected winners. The Grand Champion, presented by Phantom, will receive 30,000 USDC.

[**Announcing the Solana Cypherpunk Hackathon**]( # ?? Hackathon RFPs Colosseum has outlined project ideas it would like to see explored in the upcoming [Cypherpunk Hackathon]( **Highlighted suggestions include:** * **P2P payments for bordering countries** focused on specific payment corridors or niche communities. * **Groupchat trading tools** that allow pooled capital and collective trading on platforms like Telegram. * **Onchain transparency ratings** to differentiate legitimate projects from scams using zkTLS or crowdsourced analysis. * **Permissionless prediction markets** where anyone can create and trade predictions without centralized oversight. These ideas are meant as inspiration and do not guarantee prizes, funding, or entry into Colosseums accelerator program. Colosseum has published additional areas of interest beyond those listed here, and developers are encouraged to review the full post for more suggestions and details. [**Request For Products**]( # ??Prediction Markets A new guide on prediction markets maps out how these products work and the trade-offs builders face. The TLDR is simple: prediction markets are no longer niche, with more than 450 projects now tracked and volumes hitting record highs. At their core, every forecasting product must answer two questions: how to price beliefs today and who decides the truth tomorrow. The guide covers the mechanics of prediction markets, the design choices available, and real-world examples. It is organized around three main axes: 1. **Resolution:** Who determines outcomes, from optimistic oracles to human editors, courts, rulebooks, or automated feeds. 2. **Market design**: How prices form, whether through AMMs, pools, orderbooks, or scoring-rule tournaments. 3. **Infrastructure**: Where the system runs, including on-chain setups, hybrid regulated venues, or off-chain tournaments. This research provides a practical framework for evaluating trade-offs and design models. Builders in this emerging space are advised to choose resolution methods they trust, pricing engines their liquidity can support, and infrastructure that will not fail at settlement time. [**The Technical Typology of Prediction/Forecasting Projects**]( # ?? Asynchronous Market Queues (AMQs) Asynchronous Market Queues (AMQs) introduce a new way for Solana applications to control how trades are executed. Instead of strict first-come-first-serve ordering, AMQs let apps batch transactions and decide their own execution rules. This model, called Application Controlled Execution (ACE), can give market makers more flexibility, reduce losses from sudden price jumps, and enable tighter spreads and better liquidity. AMQs divide program instructions into two types. 1. **Synchronous instructions** (such as deposits or withdrawals) that execute immediately. 2. **Asynchronous instructions** (such as cancels or limit orders) that are added to a priority queue. Each instruction is tagged with its slot and sequence number, then sorted according to application-defined rules. The queue is later processed after a short delay or when full, ensuring execution happens in priority order rather than simply by arrival time. Solana is uniquely positioned to support AMQs because programs can already queue and sort asynchronous instructions without requiring any protocol changes. This allows builders to experiment with new market models that would not be possible in traditional finance or on most other blockchains. For DeFi builders, AMQs open the door to policy-aware sequencing, application-specific auctions, and more innovative execution mechanisms. [**Application Controlled Execution (ACE) through Asynchronous Market Queues (AMQs)**]( # ?? dApp Revenue Dominance Solanas dApp ecosystem continues to show strong revenue momentum with record highs and steady growth across categories. August numbers show both record highs and steady growth across categories. Key highlights include: * **DePIN projects** posted an all-time high of $1.6M in revenue, up 60% month-over-month, led by Helium, GEODNET, UpRock, and Hivemapper. * **DeFiTuna** reached $422K, distributing 100% of revenue to stakers. * **Hylo** set a new record with $238K in revenue, driven by its dual-token model and adaptive mint/redeem fees. * **Squads Protocol** marked its eighth consecutive month of growth, reaching $35K from rising business subscriptions and multisig activity. * **Helium** now routes subscription and usage revenue directly to onchain burns, boosting DePIN revenue sustainability. These results highlight the depth and diversification of revenue across Solanas ecosystem. Check out the full report for a complete breakdown.

BitcoinKit Zeus Network has introduced BitcoinKit, an open-source infrastructure toolkit that transforms Bitcoin into programmable money on Solana. The goal is to give developers direct, permissionless access to Bitcoins $2T liquidity without relying on custodians, wrapped tokens, or fragmented L2 solutions. BitcoinKit leverages ZeusLayer to verify and tokenize BTC deposits in real time, creating zBTC, a token backed 1:1 by native Bitcoin. Once issued, zBTC can flow seamlessly into Solana DeFi protocols, where it behaves like any other onchain asset while retaining Bitcoins underlying security guarantees. BitcoinKit is designed with a developer-first approach, offering multiple integration paths including widgets, agents, CLI tools, APIs, and full SDKs. BitcoinKit debuts inside Jupnet (Jupiters Omnichain Liquidity Network), enabling users to deposit and withdraw native BTC directly into Solana. This gives developers the ability to build Bitcoin-backed lending markets, BTC-stablecoin swaps,or yield products, all powered by Solanas high-throughput runtime. [**BitcoinKit: The Open Infrastructure Kit Unlocking Bitcoin's Programmable Economy**]( # ??? DFlow JIT Router DFlow has relaunched with a rebuilt aggregator, new interface, and a new Just in Time routing engine that can optimize a swap during transaction execution, not only before it. Traditional aggregators calculate routes offchain, locking them in before a transaction is executed, often leading to failed swaps or heavy slippage. DFlows JIT Router solves this by checking market prices at the moment of execution. If conditions have shifted, it automatically reroutes to the best venue all within the same transaction. Swap instructions can branch dynamically, letting the router select the optimal liquidity source in real time so traders capture the best price on swaps. Developers can leverage JIT Routing to offer users the best swaps in their own apps, focusing on product innovation while DFlow ensures trades settle efficiently under the hood. [**The DFlow JIT Router: Bringing Routing Intelligence Onchain**]( # ?? Phantom Cash Phantom has launched Phantom Cash, a new consumer payments platform that expands its Solana wallet into a full money app. Powered by $CASH, a USD-pegged stablecoin issued via Bridge (Stripes Open Issuance infrastructure), Phantom Cash lets users add money via bank or card directly in-app, buy/sell stablecoins with no fees, and spend anywhere Visa is accepted through Apple Pay, Google Pay, or a Phantom debit card. Launching exclusively on Solana (initially), Phantom Cash signals the wallets shift from a crypto-first product to a mainstream consumer payments app, giving its 15M monthly users an easy way to spend, send, and save with stablecoins. Builders can integrate CASH into DeFi protocols, payments apps, and consumer products and a path to connect payments and stablecoin DeFi in one ecosystem. [**Introducing Phantom Cash: New Money, Now in Your Wallet**]( # ?? Wallet UI v2 Wallet UI v2 is a major update that makes the developer toolkit leaner, and more reliable. The release includes: * Comprehensive new docs with examples * Fixes for functional and logical errors that broke apps or caused odd behavior * Separation of Gill SDK into its own package, allowing cleaner composition with any client * Improved stability and flexibility This modular shift means devs can now plug Wallet UI into different backends, creating a clean upgrade path to modern SDKs.

p_1nytub3,"Time-locked staking vault project idea Ive been toying with this idea since I saw [KDs bitcoin story]( and wanted to see what people think of it. Something like a **solana program vault** (or smart contract) that lets you deposit crypto and *forces* you to hold it for a fixed time  1, 5, 10 years or more. * The funds are **locked by the contract**, no one (including devs) can withdraw early. * During the lock, the contract could **auto-stake** the SOL so it still earns yield. * At maturity, it automatically sends everything (principal + yield) back to your wallet.

p_1nx9zc3,"Play Solana | PSG1 - Introducing The Play Solana SuperHUB, Integrating Hardware, Software, And Culture Into A Single System **Source:** [ # A New Foundation for Web3 Gaming What began as a community-led project with no external funding has grown into a live platform powering consoles, games, and wallets, across the Solana ecosystem. Today, Play Solana is unveiling its boldest step forward: a unified distribution engine for Web3 gaming.The Play Solana SuperHUB is a vertically integrated ecosystem that unites hardware, games, identity, DeFi, and cultural IP into one seamless foundation. Built to address the structural flaws of Web3 gaming, SuperHUB is designed to onboard millions of players through a premium, intuitive experience. # Why Web3 Gaming Hasnt Broken Out Despite years of progress and billions in funding, Web3 gaming has yet to achieve mainstream traction. User numbers remain small, retention is weak, and cultural impact has been limited compared to traditional platforms. The data underscores the gap: * In May 2025, Web3 gaming recorded 4.9 million daily active wallets. This figure represents wallet activity, not unique players, and it accounts for less than 0.6% of the 820 million active crypto wallets globally. * By comparison, Roblox reports over 112 million daily active users, while Steam has more than 69 million. Even when measured against individual platforms, the entire Web3 gaming ecosystem still lags significantly in both scale and retention. [Steam and Roblox DAU figures reflect unique users, while Web3 gaming DAU refers to unique wallet interactions and may not represent individual players. Web3 data includes all wallet activity across blockchain gaming dApps. Sources: Steam \(\~69M DAU\) from Backlinko & DemandSage; Roblox \(\~112M DAU\) from DemandSage; Web3 gaming \(\~4.9M daily unique active wallets in May 2025\) from DappRadar.]( > This disparity is not just about scale; it reflects deeper structural flaws: 1. No onboarding funnel: Most games assume players arrive with a wallet and blockchain knowledge. There is no accessible entry point that attracts users through story, gameplay, or curiosity. 2. Lack of fun-first design: Many titles adopted Play-to-Earn models that prioritized speculation over gameplay. Yield mechanics and NFT flipping replaced creativity, and retention collapsed once incentives faded. 3. Fragmented experience: Players must navigate multiple wallets, dApps, and tokens with no unified identity, rewards, or progression. 4. No physical anchor: Every major gaming revolution was driven by a console or device. Web3 still lacks a consumer-grade entry point that merges gameplay, culture, and ownership. The result is an ecosystem where friction outweighs fun, culture takes a back seat to speculation, and the breakout product for mass adoption has yet to emerge. # The Play Solana SuperHUB The Play Solana SuperHUB re-architects Web3 gaming from first principles. It integrates hardware, software, and culture into a single system where every layer reinforces the [others.At]( its foundation is a single physical entry point: the PSG1 handheld console. Around it, a modular ecosystem connects games, wallets, identity, branded IP, and rewards. This design provides players with a unified experience where onboarding, progression, and engagement flow naturally without the friction of multiple tools or fragmented interfaces.This is not another isolated dApp. It is a distribution engine designed to unify gameplay, ownership, and culture at scale. # A Vertically Integrated Gaming Stack A New Game Boy for a New Internet PSG1 is a powerful, retro-futuristic handheld console engineered for modern gaming. It combines high-performance hardware, a premium OLED display, and a built-in crypto wallet in a sleek, portable form. The device runs EchOS, a custom Android-based operating system tailored for gaming, and integrates SvalGuard, a security layer that streamlines wallet authentication, staking, and in-game transactions. **A Growing Universe for Gaming** The Play Solana Gaming Library curates native and third-party titles into one launcher. Flagships like Play Solana: Origins transform onboarding into gameplay, teaching staking, swaps, and NFTs through fun-first design. Integrations like BONK Arena demonstrate how community-driven tokens evolve into playable ecosystems. **A Gateway for Rewards and Identity** Play<Dex> is the platform hub where players complete quests, stake, climb leaderboards, and track progress within the ecosystem. Play<ID> provides persistent, on-chain identity across devices, binding rewards and reputation to every interaction. **On-Chain Identity as Culture** Play Solana is building IP for the future. <Player1> and <Player2> are not collectibles; they are living identity layers tied to progression, governance, and community. Together, they form the foundation of an evolving on-chain reputation system. **DeFi Woven Into Gameplay** In the SuperHUB, DeFi becomes part of the play loop. Validator rewards, staking, and swaps are embedded directly into games and consoles. Integrations like Jupiter Mobile Wallet deliver institutional-grade DeFi tools without browser extensions, turning financial engagement into natural gameplay. # Real Partners. Real Products. Real Traction. The Play Solana SuperHUB is not a concept. It is already live, validated through real integrations, trusted partners, and tangible use cases across gaming, DeFi, and culture. Each case demonstrates how the SuperHUB converts community momentum and infrastructure into active player engagement. IP Distribution Engine: BONK Arena Developed with BRAVO READY and the BONK community, BONK Arena shows how meme-driven, token-first communities can evolve into fully playable ecosystems. Native deployment on PSG1, combined with co-branded hardware, turns cultural energy into sustained gameplay. [ # DeFi in Your Pocket: Jupiter Mobile Wallet Jupiters institutional-grade DeFi suite is embedded directly into the PSG1 launcher through SvalGuard. Players access swaps, staking, and other DeFi tools from the same console where they play. No browser extensions or third-party apps are required. This integration demonstrates how SuperHUB makes advanced finance seamless and accessible. [ # Cultural IP Activation: Pudgy Penguins Pudgy Penguins, one of Web3s most recognizable cultural brands, is expanding its universe across both hardware and gameplay through Play Solana. Co-branded consoles and upcoming IRL activations transform community fandom into on-chain utility, proving that cultural IP can become a driving force for attention. [ # New Market Creation: MoonPay Exclusive Edition MoonPay leverages PSG1 as a premium distribution channel for its partners and high-profile users. This initiative highlights an entirely new category of digital-physical (phygital) products: co-branded gaming hardware that merges exclusivity, ownership, and distribution into one model.Together, these cases illustrate the positive flywheel of the SuperHUB: more IP collaborations lead to stronger distribution, which drives higher engagement, increases demand, and ultimately sustains retention. [ # Conclusion: A New Foundation for Web3 Gaming Web3 gaming does not just need better games; it needs a better foundation.The Play Solana SuperHUB delivers that foundation: hardware, games, identity, and DeFi working in unison. It replaces fragmentation with cohesion, speculation with culture, and barriers with accessibility.This is not another platform. It is a growth loop, a cultural layer, and a distribution engine designed to bring Web3 gaming into the [mainstream.Play]( Solana is not following trends. It is redefining what a gaming ecosystem can be.

""Solana's Capital Engine"" That Collaborates To Scale Solanas RWA And Tokenized Assets **Source:** [ # Introducing, Keel: Solana's Capital Engine # Solanas Breakout Point >Yet, if Solana is to achieve the vision of internet capital markets then technology alone is not enough - liquidity catalysts and enablers are required. # The Chicken, the Egg, and the Liquidity Layer * Robust lending and cross-asset liquidity * Rates that remain stable and competitive * Institutional scale demand for tokenized asset issuances >Scalable capital and liquidity will be the enablers for Solanas onchain financial markets to reach the next stage of growth and maturity. # Keel is Solanas Capital Engine Powered by Sky (formerly MakerDAO), the issuer of USDS, and one of DeFis most proven protocols, Keel is purpose-built to provide the structural support that Solanas financial markets require to scale. # A $2.5bn Catalyst for Growth As an onchain capital allocator with an initial roadmap of $2.5bn, Keel will kickstart the capital allocation flywheel, enabling conditions for more capital to enter the Solana ecosystem. # A Value Multiplier By plugging into Skys infrastructure, Keel is empowered to be a multiplicative force for the Solana ecosystem  utilizing over-collateralized debt to support credit creation and improve liquidity. # A Liquidity Layer The Keel liquidity layer will be integrated directly with Solanas largest DeFi protocols and tokenized asset issuers, dynamically reallocating stablecoin liquidity to provide the stability and depth required to operate at scale. # Areas of Focus These are the initial areas of focus for the Keel Capital Engine, and some of the benefits it will aim to generate for the Solana ecosystem: # Stablecoin Lending * Deeper, more liquid stablecoin lending markets - enabling leverage on high quality collateral and the ability to borrow in much larger sizes, with greater capital efficiency. # Stablecoin Swaps * Greater depth and stability for stablecoin swaps - by providing swap liquidity for leading stablecoin pairs, Keel reinforces ecosystem depth and peg stability. # Liquidity and TVL Bootstrapping * Support for bootstrapping new issuances and DeFi products from zero to one with substantial stablecoin reserves vs third-party capital. # Savings * Enabling a predictable, stable, and continuously compounding yield, with native staking and redemption free of fees or lockup, for individuals through to institutions. # RWA Yields, Redemption, and Secondary Liquidity * Removing friction for tokenized assets and RWAs at scale by allocating at size into tokenized yield-bearing assets and strategies, and improving onchain liquidity, redemptions, and liquidations by bridging traditional finance with always-on DeFi markets. # Join us in taking Solanas Capital Markets to the Next Stage Whether youre a builder, an issuer, or a follower, track the progress of Solanas Capital Engine on X and stay up to date with our latest developments on [Substack](",2025-09-30 17:46:32,ansi09,post,solana,,Reddit,introduce keel capital engine collaborate scale rwa tokenized asset introduce keel capital engine breakout point achieve vision internet capital technology liquidity catalyst enabler require chicken egg liquidity layer robust lending cross asset liquidity rate remain stable competitive institutional scale demand tokenized asset issuance scalable capital liquidity enabler onchain financial reach stage growth maturity keel capital engine power sky makerdao issuer usds prove protocol keel purpose build provide structural support financial require scale catalyst growth onchain capital allocator initial roadmap keel kickstart capital allocation flywheel enable condition capital enter ecosystem value multipli plug sky infrastructure keel empower multiplicative force ecosystem utilize collateralized debt support credit creation improve liquidity liquidity layer keel liquidity layer integrate directly large protocol tokenized asset issuer dynamically reallocate stablecoin liquidity provide stability depth require operate scale area focus initial area focus keel capital engine benefit aim generate ecosystem stablecoin lending deep liquid stablecoin lending enable leverage high quality collateral ability borrow large size great capital efficiency stablecoin swap great depth stability stablecoin swap provide swap liquidity lead stablecoin pair keel reinforce ecosystem depth peg stability liquidity tvl bootstrappe support bootstrappe new issuance product zero substantial stablecoin reserve party capital saving enable predictable stable continuously compound yield native staking redemption free fee lockup individual institution rwa yield redemption secondary liquidity remove friction tokenized asset rwa scale allocate size tokenized yield asset strategy improve onchain liquidity redemption bridge traditional finance join capital stage builder issuer follower track progress capital engine stay date late development substack,0.013,0.705,0.281,0.9969,positive,neutral

And not for nothing...but those easy gains would be pretty hollow and pointless if, say, the spectacular level of Trumpist corruption we are currently witnessing leads to an over-correction from regulators that suffocates the industry. Kinda like how if all the money I made shorting DJT at IPO is in USD, and if Trump's group of regards do something even dumber than expected (like default on the debt, kill Fed independence, etc.), my savvy ended up worthless. Or, let's say you're a woman. Or a brown person. Or an atheist. Or a liberal. Or a Liberal. How many degrees of freedom do you think you'll have with your accumulated wealth when the far-right Christian Nationalists have fully consolidated power? I'm guessing less than preferred.

Forgive yourself. You failed because you are human. Even the most disciplined investors fall into the trap of just one exception when life gets difficult. Shame is a heavy weight, and it clouds decision-making. 2. Build a foundation. Cash may not be exciting, but it gives you breathing room. Three to six months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account or money market fund can make all the difference. 3. Reconsider 100% btc. Putting 100% of your capital into a single asset, no matter how strong your conviction, exposes you to existential risk. You don't have to give up on Bitcoin. But maybe next time, it's 50% BTC, 30% in broad equities, 20% in bonds or cash. 4. DCA. After what happened, it's natural to want to be more careful before putting money back in. But I want to be honest with you: waiting for a specific price like 90k can quietly turn into another trap. 4. Leveraging. If you want to accelerate growth, look into investing in skills that enhance your earning potential 5. Not too late. 2530+ years of potential compounding left. Youre not behind.

c_nj4ezkr,"Guys one thing to note, prices keep going up until new money buys in at higher prices. If this circle breaks price will go down. If noone is willing to buy more when the price keeps going lower at a fast pace it won't stop dumping. Liquidations occur and it spirals to even lower levels. But who is willing to buy when shit is going down quick? Let me ask you, what are your first thoughts if you see a flush like that happening real rime? Because if it's not "" let me deposit my investing money and buy that shit up"" you are the reason for it going lower. Zero sum game. Someone has to be willing to buy when there is blood on the streets. Are you going to be the one to enter a volatile market with your hard earned money? Probably not. So don't cry if someone else is entering at like all time lows on some alt. You can enter yourselves. But you all look at these events like crypto is a scam and shit. No it is very decent and quick way to take the money from dumb people by the smarter people. Market making works with few million dollars on leverage, you don't need billions like on nasdaq. Precise traders can make quick money every day. Even I had a short on NQ before the dump was happening and I'm not even a profitable trader. Listen to price action. Any news is a straight up lie or manipulation. The only thing that can't lie is price. Some traders in the group I belong to made shorts on crypto an hour before the dump started. Don't you think professional traders won't catch up? They see shit before it happens and its all spiraling into price falling quick. As if more people enter a short they are helping this to happen. Its not manipulation by trump, news accelerate the process but price action traders see it before happening. It is YOU people that make it happen by stupid decisions, bad stoploss placements, high leverage, using the whole account etc. You give the market a selling pressure shock which immediately turns into high level liquidations which can't be stopped unless someone big is willing to buy.

Repealing Glass-Steagal while also pushing 401ks as THE retirement method has made it so that institutions like BlackRock are too big. BkackRock has more AuM than most countries. Thats too much power for a private firm and Id argue it is whats driving asset inflation. They can artificially prop up the values of whatever they choose just through buying power.

c_nhjby7h,"Not really. Maintenance on a NYC co-op tends to be about $1000/month per million of valuation in a fully staffed building (doorman building). That includes taxes and building costs as well as a lot of staffing labor costs. Assuming a five million dollar apartment, which is how I got to $5000, $60k a year in maintenance inclusive of property taxes is probably about right in my own experience. A friend of mine has a SoHo coop apartment worth about 1.8 million in a fully staffed (24/7 doorman, live-in super, porters, handymen, cleaning staff) and they pay about $2k a month in maintenance. For those unfamiliar with NYC real estate, maintenance is a term that doesnt just mean fixing stuff. Its a fee you pay to the co-op association youre a member of to cover building staff (doormen, porters, handymen, super) and all upkeep of the actual building, like facade repair and roof replacement costs. (You can also be hit with assessments for major building repairs over and above monthly maintenance.) Maintenance also covers property taxes, which is large piece of it, building insurance, and any mortgage servicing costs on the building itself (beyond the apartment). The fancier the building, the more expensive the maintenance is as a percent of valuation. Full time doormen and porters are unionized and make good money. A coop with a full time 24/7 building staff easily spends a million or more a year in benefits, taxes, and wages. Im guessing a multimillion dollar 5th Avenue penthouse is in a fully staffed building. If the building has 50 units, thats a couple grand per unit per month right there. Ill try to pop over to streeteasy and see what maintenance is on five million dollar coops these days. Its not a search Im usually doing lol. High end NYC real estate is wild. The numbers are insane. Thats why Im laughing, these boys think ten million net worth is 5th Avenue Penthouse and Hamptons weekends *rich*!these days. Thats an upper middle class retirement account for NYC finance bros and lawyers and such. Edit: Lol downvoted for knowing what Im talking about. Ok here you go. This is a 2BR/2ba coop in a fully staffed building on 5th Ave in Greenwich Village. On a lower floor, no less. For sale for 3.4 million bucks right now. Monthly maintenance is listed as $4612 a month. I got my middle-class ass out of living in NYC years ago and live in the woods these days. As the old saying goes, (I think it was Hemingway), the rich are different than you and I, they have more money. And yeah that doesnt even begin to include parking lol. Downtown, typically thats another $2-3k a month to have a garage spot. And thats for the $100k Land Rover you only use for those weekend trips to the Hamptons, hence those big Uber Black bills. Heck, you gotta pay a $9 congestion pricing toll every time you enter Manhattan below 60th st now and on top of whatever bridge or tunnel toll you paid to get there. Theres well off. And theres rich. In NYC in 2025 ten mil in the bank does not make you rich by local standards. Its a world unto itself.

My issue with your post is that you are implying that when you bought on credit, it was safer (for various reasons you list in your post) than today. That is vastly wrong. BTC is a brutally volatile asset and it was like that back in 2015 as well as today. In 2011 BTC crashed 94% from $32 to $2, in 2013-2015 it crashed by 85%, in 2017-2018 by 84%, 2022 by 77%, so no matter when you bought it, and at what price, you still could face a huge drawdown... If you buy on credit and have no other means to repay the credit than using the proceeds from your investment (for example borrow money to buy BTC but use your salary to pay the loan back while letting your BTC grow, then you can get wiped out any time. With BTC you have two options to deal with its volatility: wait it out (which few people can stomach) or set yourself internal safety brakes where you get out no matter what to protect the principal (which few people can handle either, usually they end up buying high and selling low). But there are methods to peg your trades to volatility metrics and trade them using BTC.

Unless you're privy to their algos you won't beat them in timing or swing trading so holding long term is the only play now imo. Also, pull BTC off the exchanges when possible. Exchanges are now part of the traditional financial system and may have incentive to rehypothecate your Bitcoin. One big power in BTC is that it is limited supply, don't let institutions control that supply for their own benefit. Even Saylor and MSTR may be part of the overarching problem.

While there are many games that big finance players will play, and some that could put bitcoin at risk, I think the implication that timing is required to come out ahead when buying bitcoin on credit is not entirely fair. It's not so much about timing the market, as it is is about time in the market. Credit is a viable option still, but carries a risk. If you're not able to maintain the debt independent of bitcoin's fortunes, you're walking into an ambush. However, if for instance you take out $100k at 14% today, and can pay down that debt for 60 months at $2300/mo, and just hodl the bitcoin, then it's not inconceivable that bitcoin will go up more than 14% overall in that time-period, and that you can therefore significantly improve your financial position.

c_njs32v6,"Ok from chat gpt: Thanks for sharing the image. Here are some important observations to help determine if this is legitimate or a scam: ? ?? Key Red Flags in the Letter ? Ledger rarely sends physical letters  They officially state that they do NOT send unsolicited postal mail to users. ? Mentions a QR code to activate a feature  This is a classic phishing method. Scammers often trick users into scanning QR codes to visit fake sites or install malicious apps. ? Mandatory by October 10th, 2025  Unrealistically far-out deadline is unusual and designed to add pressure but avoid immediate suspicion. ? Asks you to take action to maintain access  Legit Ledger updates usually happen inside the Ledger Live app itself, not via external instructions. ? Physical address (Paris) & CEO signature  These can easily be copied from public information. Scammers often add them to seem official. ? ? What a Real Ledger Update Looks Like Ledger normally communicates updates via:  Official Ledger Live app (desktop/mobile)  ledger.com blog or status page  Verified email from @ledger.com (never asking you to scan QR for setup)  In-device firmware update They never ask you to: ?? Scan a QR code from a letter ?? Visit a link outside ledger.com without warning ?? Provide any sensitive info via external form ? ? What YOU Should Do Now ? Do NOT scan the QR code ? Do NOT visit any URL printed in the letter (unless you type it manually and confirm it is EXACTLY ledger.com) ? Go into Ledger Live > Settings > Security and check if Transaction Check exists officially ? Contact Ledger Support directly via ledger.com/support with a photo of the letter ? ?? My Verdict: Highly likely a SCAM / phishing attempt Physical letters + QR code + urgency is a known phishing tactic targeting hardware wallet users. ? If you want, I can check Ledgers official announcements for you or help you verify the URL or the QR code (without you opening it).

c_njs3gyl,"I checked Ledgers official sources  heres what I found: ? ? What Ledger does say  Ledger has a blog post introducing Transaction Check as a legitimate security feature: it analyzes Ethereum (EVM) transactions for potential threats before you sign them. ?  Ledgers Transaction Check glossary page states the same feature and explicitly says: Ledger has not made any communications about Transaction Check via mail. Any letters you may have received regarding Transaction Check are scam attempts. ?  On their phishing & security status page, Ledger warns that physical mail prompting users to scan a QR code or visit a website is a known phishing scheme: Users are receiving physical letters  The letters  ask you to scan a QR or go to the website  Ultimately, users are requested to enter their 24 words. ?  Ledgers phishing page also states: Ledger and Ledger support will never ask for your 24 words  Ledger will never contact you via text message or phone call and If you have doubts about a communication, check Ledgers official channels. ?  Other security blogs have documented Ledger Physical Letter Scam describing very similar letters with QR codes and urging users to enter their seed phrase. ? ? ? Conclusion (Based on Official Info + Evidence)  Transaction Check is real, as a Ledger feature.  However, Ledger explicitly disavows any postal communications about it. Any physical letter asking you to activate Transaction Check via QR code or a link is a scam (phishing).  The letter you received matches exactly what Ledger warns about as part of a scam campaign. So, the letter is almost certainly fraudulent / phishing, not something sent by Ledger. ? If you like, I can help you decode the QR or URL (without visiting it) and see what site it leads to.

c_nk0q9w1,"Can we be real here though? If Bitcoin loses 50% of it's value, like it has done several times, it will be a bloodbath on Wallstreet. Most of these crypto companies are valued at multiples of their Bitcoin holdings. Worse yet, a lot of them financed their Bitcoin purchases with debt. This absolutely can lead to a scenario where Bitcoin has to be liquidated to pay their liabilities, while their balance sheet tanks because Bitcoin is basically the only asset on the books, which will lead to investor selloff which will lead to more devaluation which will lead to default which will lead to total liquidation, which will lead to Bitcoin price suppression which will lead to more defaults and it will get nasty. Is there a scenario where all these companies have time to pay off their debt and can weather a cycle? Yes. Is there a scenario where crypto never hits lows that could trigger the chain reaction? Yes. History to me indicates the most likely scenario is when do have another major crash at some point though. But my bets are the next crypto winter will be fueled by a lot of these wallstreet companies failing. Think Mt Gox or FTX or Celsius, but 100 times worse. When will it happen? No clue and I wouldn't be advertising it if I did, I wish I did obviously. But I learned long ago not to try to time these things. I do foresee lots of people will lose a lot of money and blame Bitcoin not the institutions and humans that are using obscene leverage on a volatile asset. Basically, and I'm sure I will be downvoted, but the only thing I disagree with Adam Schiff on is his proclamation that ""its about to hit"". Unless he is part of some cabal that has the ability and motivation to force the first domino to fall, the when is just unknown. The price could hit $500,000 before a crash which would mean unless these wallstreet companies keep issuing new debt and DCA up to similar prices, a 50% crash would not spell doom for them. But now, there is a bubble in the industry. And I have no faith these companies won't continue to be greedy in their leverage. The most recent financials of the Bitcoin based companies paint a clear picture to me, Bitcoin going to $50,000 would be death for most. The best strategy is and will continue to be stacking sats, self custody, ignore the price swings, and HODL.",2025-10-17 20:01:41,Chemfreak,comment,bitcoin,,Reddit,real lose value like bloodbath wallstreet company value multiple holding bad lot finance purchase debt absolutely lead scenario liquidate pay liability balance sheet tank basically asset book lead selloff lead devaluation lead default lead total lead suppression lead default nasty scenario company pay debt weather cycle yes scenario hit low trigger chain reaction yes history indicate likely scenario major crash point bet winter fuel lot wallstreet company failing gox ftx celsius bad happen clue wouldn advertise wish obviously learn long ago try thing foresee lot lose lot blame institution human obscene leverage volatile asset basically sure downvote thing disagree adam schiff proclamation hit cabal ability motivation force domino fall unknown hit crash mean wallstreet company issue new debt dca similar crash spell doom bubble industry faith company win continue greedy leverage recent financial base company paint clear picture death good strategy continue stack sat self custody ignore swing,0.292,0.521,0.187,-0.9652,negative,neutral

c_njjqckf,"Im trying to figure out how they did it, the article was pure garbage and obviously on the side of the ""traders"" aka predatory mev bots who make trades more expensive for everyone who uses a dex. Fuck them and I think its great these guys figured out a way to get back at them. The article is super vague, but it does say the ""traders"" aka mev bots were left with a lot of worthless memecoins instead of their actual money. Mev bots work by finding a transaction about to go through the blockchain that isnt paying top fees fir gas for the transaction, so they can exploit it since its a slower transaction. They buy a huge amount of the coin right before you buy, and then sell a huge amount right after your transaction goes through. So you are trying to buy in at $1 a coin, but as you put in your transaction the mev bot pumps it to $1.5, so you buy the coin for 1.5, and then they sell a huge amount to drop it back down to 1. So now you have to see a 50% gain just to break even because some mevbot sniped your trade. These guys fucked a mevbot, so Bravo. I have some guesses. Ive seen mevbots do trades in the 100s of thousands before to super spike a price. I have no idea how it works but I wonder if there's some set of parameters that makes it choose to go all in like that, and they found that out and then set that situation up, but then had a bot of their own to see when another bot took the bait, let them do the first transaction, and then go crazy max gas fees to alter their coin to turn off selling or give it a 99% sell tax or something. Or just pull the liquidity entirely, so there's just nothing for the mev bot to get back.

c_njkxc8u,"From what I understand reading some other articles, it appears that MEV bots do some shady or unethical stuff to manipulate prices, but that is an unfortunate consequence of how the system is set up -- theyre taking advantage of the system as it was designed to operate. These guys just straight up hacked the system to get it to do something it wasnt intended to do, by exploiting some bots that werent performing all the security checks they should have to make sure the trades were legitimate trades. To try and give an example, banks used to do something where they would order transactions in such a way to make you overdraft and charge you fees, for example if you had a balance of 1k, and made a 5k withdrawal and later that day a 5k deposit, they would order the withdrawal first so that you incurred an overcharge fee, then do the deposit. Now imagine there was an automated system/bot you could run so that you could automatically deposit into your account to avoid overdraft fees when the bank sends you an email that youre overdrawn. The brothers then did something like spoofing emails to make it look like the emails legitimately came from the bank to get you to deposit into an account, except it was their account the money was deposited into, and they just straight up took it. They also specifically targeted bots that werent implementing security protocols correctly to verify that the transactions were 100% legit before depositing money. Then, afterwards, they took a bunch of elaborate steps to launder the money in the hopes of not getting caught. Not a perfect analogy, but thats \*along the same lines\* of what they did. And they seem to be pinning their defense on the fact that a) people hate what MEV bots do enough to look the other way that straight up stealing from bots that do shady/unethical stuff is okay, and b) that it will all be so technical that people dont actually understand what happened.

I say cash as meaning that which can easily be used to pay for or buy things. The idea is to be able to use the asset to live off of without needing to sell any ever. This is what true HODLing looks like to me. If you cant figure out how to make your BTC cash-flow then youre left with 2 options: 1. Start selling/trading off a piece at a time in the future until theres none left, or 2. Borrow against it and work to pay it back over time.

c_ni13qb1,"It is actually the most efficient option. When you factor in capacity nuclear is less expensive in the GWh delivered over the life of the plant. Even with the regulation cost if you factor in capacity nuclear performs better. It is true that it is more expensive upfront (around 3x the capital cost per MW), but like I mentioned it pays off from a capacity perspective. In the case of Germany the plants were already built, and waste is not that expensive as the waste is small relative to energy output. The technology to recycle waste is on the way. I used to be against nuclear. Then I got solar panels and see how inefficient they are. I still like solar for remote locations, but when I looked at the data for all the different types of power nuclear is the most practical, and considered one of the safest with today's technology. The reality is with the coming demand of data centers nuclear power is likely going to be the primary option capable of delivering the capacity required. Hydro is competitive for high capacity solutions, so maybe that will pan out as well. Microsoft is already rebuilding the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, Google has small nuclear reactors, and many more nuclear projects already in place and on the way.

c_nhgc4y7,"Hi ETH Fam!! Been in ETH since 2017. Not on here much but like to post an update of my thoughts once in a while. The message is simple...we are close!! The world is noticing that tokenization and stable coins will mainly happen on Ethereum. Many of the largest players are now building on ETH!! In the US, most merchants will accept Stable coins soon. Think about what that will do to adoption in the next couple years? What percent of the US has a crypto wallet now and will have one within two years? The visionaries have already started building on ETH and its getting close to where countries, banks, rush to launch stable coins in order to reduce cost and integrate into the new crypto economy and not to be left behind to competition (many are already scrambling). Most countries will have a stable coin, once that happens their citizens will probably start getting wallets (think about the global adoption that will create). Stable coins are going to bring in the world to crypto and it isn't a dream or vision anymore. It's already starting to happen. So while this is happening, DAT's are continuing to buy ETH while inflation is less than BTC. Monthly ETH ETF inflows have been higher than BTCs while BTC has over 4X MC. ETH staking ETFs are about to be approved. I think this will incentivize more companies to hold ETH on their balance sheets. What some of us have been patiently waiting for is now right around the corner. I believe ETH price is going to explode before the end of the year. Once the seal is broken, I think the future of ETH price will not look like the past. I know its been a rough ride but hang on tight, we are just one large catalyst away from take off.

And even though I owned zero altcoins, and many of them went to *literal* zero yesterday, and are at an All Time Low right now, I still have no interest in investing even $10 in any of them. Sure, there are some great dApps. AAVE. Uniswap. ENS. Rocketpool. Arbitrum. Optimism. But, I use them without ever interacting with their token. I had no FOMO to buy when token X or Y was worth $500, and I have no interest or reason to buy now that it's worth $0.5 and has the marketcap of a lemonade stand. In my mind, the Altcoin experiment is over, and has failed. The death of Solana (it will happen sooner or later, maybe when its blockchain reaches three Exabytes?) will be further proof. I had some fun with it for a while (when I was salty at its outperformance over ETH for like a year), made some beer money, got some airdrops, and got out. If your response is going to be ""bottom signal for Alts"", sure, maybe you can make 2-3X if you hit the correct one in the casino, but it will still be true that they need 10X at best and 10000X at worst to even go back to where they stood in 2021. So, where does this leave us? What's the thesis? Well, there's only one coin besides BTC that feels ""alive"". That has volume, activity, metrics compared to BTC. That has managed to not die for ten years, and is also the ***ONLY*** coin that hit a new ATH for three cycles in a row... every single cycle it has existed. No other coin has managed that. Every coin launched in 2015 is long forgotten by now. It would be as exceptional as Feathercoin still hitting new ATHs. (A notable exception is the first Altcoin, Litecoin, but even that ranges around the price it had in 2013.) Only Ethereum can challenge Bitcoin now. And it would have no chance of doing so, if Bitcoin wasn't so *bad*. And even so, it has to become *perfect*. Absolutely perfect. In decentralization, in scaling, in speed, in UX. You can't defeat the network effect of Bitcoin any other way. But... this might take a while. It could take years. Many years. So, for now, I am still wearing my white Crab priest cloak.

c_nix49p1,"October 10 was a bloodbath, that's the only way to describe it. Like a lot of other people, I thought about it all night, and here's what I want to tell you: Don't be deterred. Don't give up. But if what happened yesterday made you want to fold, your strategy might need adjustment. If you really believe Ethereum is an inferior technology that will eventually fail, then I encourage you to sell what you hold gracefully and move to a more sound investment. But if you believe that Ethereum is a wise long term investment and you recognize October 10 as a political and strategic move by market makers, then I need you to be smarter than them. Keep some lowball orders open all the time. Keep some stables on reserve all the time. Cash out a little when you feel giddy about the price. The truth is, I don't give a shit about markets, but I do care about decentralizing the technology, and that means empowering a lot of diverse individuals to build and maintain market positions and participate with the network in lots of ways (making transitions, self custody, running nodes, staking, engaging in community, etc.) The politicians and market makers don't give one flying fuck about you. They are the enemy. They orchestrate these events to shake cheap coins from the tree. They'll even dump hard into a crash so they can amplify it. I think you know why... They are greedy and manipulative and hell bent on making more money at any cost - even the cost of your well-being and sanity. Make no mistake, crashes are a primary tool that industry uses to consolidate power and control. In a thriving and unregulated market, market makers will shake tf out of trees to get you to give up your position so they can be stronger. I'm telling you this so you can stop caving to their will, so you can be a strong formidable opponent instead of a scared retail investor. You do not have to be weak, and you do not have to be scared because you know what your opponent is doing and they absolutely do not hold your best interest. It's not a pep talk, and I'm not telling you to have diamond hands. I'm saying that I believe that the ultimate success of this technology is built on deep decentralization and that means educating the people I care about on the tactics of those who would piss on us for their own benefit.

c_nj0egih,"Wow, I appreciate yesterday was a seismic dump but the comments in this thread are way too bearish. What was the reason for the dump yesterday that actually affects Ethereum? Trump tweeted something. Come one guys, you're better than this. The dump yesterday was spectacular but it happened because of all the degens gambling on leverage. If you're a long term holder of spot ETH, this should've been just another day in the crazy world of crypto. If you're suddenly bearish about Ethereum after yesterday, ask yourself why. Has anything changed fundamentally since yesterday? It's actually pretty bullish for ETH. I've seen loads of complaints and blame being placed on CEXs yesterday. Binance, Coinbase, Kraken; despite what their reputation is, they all failed at certain points yesterday. Uniswap, AAVE, Chainlink and other DeFi protocols all worked absolutely fine. We saw a spike in fees on ETH but everything worked. If you were someone that got wiped out or suffered massive losses, you must've been using leverage. If you were holding spot ETH, well nothing really happened other than the USD value went down, you still have your ETH. Crypto is one of the most volatile assets in the world, there is no need to use leverage if you have a long term view. Try not to get caught up in the feeling ""I could be making more money"" that is so easy to slip into if you read about people making crazy gains in the latest trending coins. Leverage looks really tempting if you let this feeling take hold of you. Have conviction in your crypto holdings, don't chase the trends and really don't ever use leverage unless you really know what you are doing. Ethereum will be fine, price will recover and in hindsight, this will be seen as a good test of DeFi vs. CEXs. Someday, and we're getting closer, all of global finance will run on blockchain.

c_nisugjf,"I would like to write something about mass adoption. I asked a few people at my company about cryptocurrencies. The answers were more than sobering. 95% of those surveyed are not familiar with ETH. However, 70-80% have at least heard of BTC, BUT (I estimate) 99% have no idea how crypto works. People are afraid of self-custody, are afraid or don't know how to register on an exchange (note: people have no problem with banks, but as soon as the word exchange comes up, they become uncertain). They don't know what a wallet is, and when it comes to word paraphrase, even the last ones decide not to buy. (Because it's too complicated) The worst thing is that even though crypto has demonstrably risen so much and the forecasts are good, very few of the people I surveyed want to invest in crypto because they have no confidence in the asset. WHY? Yes, there are countless press articles from the past about fraud, pyramid schemes, and crime. And that's exactly what stuck in everyone's minds. In addition, there are no educational initiatives on how to deal with cryptocurrencies, how to acquire them, etc. You have to teach yourself everything, and most people are not willing or even able to do so. I think all the crypto foundations that exist and have a lot of money should use it to promote and educate people about crypto. Otherwise, mass adoption will not happen anytime soon. And the entire user environment needs to be made much, much simpler.

c_nincf1w,"Heres a snippet of just how far behind the UK is Exchange Traded Notes (ETN) which dont actually hold the underlying but aim to match the index have sort of but not really yet launched for crypto. They are approved (albeit a few days late) for UK brokers but cant realistically start trading until next week in most instances. HMRC (UK tax man) has sort of but not really clarified how these crypto ETNs can be purchased within tax free ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts). For the next 6 months they can be purchased in regular Stocks & Shares ISAs, however from the new tax year youll need to find a provider that can offer you an Innovative Finance ISA and they likely wont be available in S&S ISAs but might actually be. Long term crypto ETNs may again be available in S&S ISAs as the market matures, HMRC will monitor use, performance, and demand. When the vested interests are hundreds of years old, 15 years is not yet enough time to mature an asset enough to offer permanent safe and regulated financial products. For context, the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK forces the burden for crypto-scammed customers onto retail banks. If you willingly send money to an exchange to buy crypto and send it of your own volition to a scammer, the bank has to take the losses up to £85,000. As such, most UK retail banks have banned or highly restricted transactions to crypto exchanges. So youd think some safe, regulated, supervised, financial products would help with all of the above issues but no, the UK authorities have decided to remain behind the times and on the side of scammers.",2025-10-09 20:25:54,Papazio,comment,ethereum,,Reddit,snippet far exchange note etn don actually hold underlie aim match index sort launch approve albeit late broker realistically start week instance hmrc tax man sort clarify etns purchase tax free isas individual saving account month purchase regular stock share isa new tax need find provider offer innovative finance isa likely win available isas actually long term etns available isas mature hmrc monitor use performance demand vested interest old mature asset offer permanent safe regulated financial product context financial conduct authority force burden scamme customer retail bank willingly send exchange send volition scammer bank loss retail bank ban highly restrict transaction exchange safe regulate supervise financial product help issue authority decide remain scammer,0.092,0.656,0.251,0.9628,positive,neutral

c_nj8upzo,"[Yesterday I somewhat smugly shared my thoughts]( on how to survive this market.. especially with the upcoming weeks, which might get crazy. Today, I want to double down on why you should never ever use leverage, full stop, in a market as volatile as crypto. And I will do it by sharing my own experience. So, I was always more of a holder than a trader. But back in 20172018, MakerDAO was shiny and new.. the first time you could use leverage decentrally, fully non-custodially, on-chain. I got excited by the concept and wanted to try it out.. but of course, I told myself I would play it ultra-safe. Ether had just done a wild 10x run in autumn 2017, all the way up to $1,400 per ETH. Then the market crashed 70%, recovered a bit, and fell again to around $400 in the summer of 2018. With prices down 70% from the top and six to seven months into a bear market, everyone figured this must be the double bottom. Thats when I told myself, lets go.. and I opened a MakerDAO position with what I thought was a huge safety margin. I would have been fine with another 60% drop. Liquidation would only happen around $150 per ETH. But no. ETH dropped another 50% to around $200. Thats when I decided to double down.. I mean, come on, down another 50% from where I entered with leverage, now 85% from the top. The market had to turn, right? Wrong again. In November 2018 it fell another 50%. I would have survived if ETH had stayed above $100. I didnt want to deploy more capital, so I just let the position ride, hoping I would get lucky and avoid liquidation around $80. Wrong again. ETH flushed to the low low of $80.. and I got liquidated. Over the next six months the market climbed back to $300 (by then I was done with leverage for good). But just for the record, before the 2020 bull run even began, ETH dipped below $100 twice more. Now, that was a time when things were probably simpler. Today we have decentralized perpetual platforms with massive liquidity, layered on top of a political and regulatory environment that seems to have no issue with front-running, insider trading, probably even being part of the game itself. So again.. why would anyone in their right mind use leverage in this market?",2025-10-13 10:35:18,Moschus11,comment,ethereum,,Reddit,yesterday somewhat smugly share thought survive especially upcoming week crazy today want double use leverage stop volatile share experience holder makerdao shiny new use leverage decentrally fully non custodially chain excite concept want try course tell play ultra safe ether wild run autumn way crashed recover bit fall summer seven month figure double tell let open makerdao position huge safety margin fine drop happen drop decide double mean come enter leverage turn right wrong november fall survive stay didn want deploy capital let position ride hope lucky avoid wrong flush low low liquidate month climb leverage good record run begin twice thing probably simple today decentralize perpetual platform massive liquidity layer political regulatory environment issue run insider trading probably game right mind use leverage,0.147,0.648,0.205,0.7837,positive,neutral

It wasnt a USDe failure!! It was Binances design flaw, timed with macro panic (Trumps tariffs) for cover. What looked like chaos was actually a coordinated exploitation of Binances internal pricing system, amplified by a macro shock and systemic leverage. 1?? The Setup Binances Unified Account let traders use assets like USDe, wBETH, and BNSOL as collateral. Instead of oracle or redemption prices, Binance valued these using its own spot market - a major vulnerability. On Oct 6, Binance announced a fix to move to oracle-based pricing, but rollout wasnt until Oct 14, leaving an 8-day window. 2?? The Exploit During that window, sophisticated actors manipulated Binances order books, dumping ~$6090M of USDe, driving it to $0.65 on Binance only (still ~$1 elsewhere). Because the Unified Account marked collateral to internal prices, this instantly wiped margin value and triggered $500M$1B in forced liquidations. Then, Trumps 100% China tariff headline hit, magnifying panic and liquidity stress. 3?? The Profit Engine The same day, fresh wallets on Hyperliquid opened $1.1B in BTC/ETH shorts, funded by $110M USDC from Arbitrum-linked sources. As the Binance cascade unfolded, BTC and ETH cratered, those shorts netted $192M in profit before closing out at the bottom. Timing, precision, and funding paths all suggest coordination. 4?? The Contagion Binance liquidations dumped BTC/ETH/ALTs into thin books. Other exchanges mirrored the collapse through cross-market bots. Market makers hedged across venues were forced to unwind everywhere. Result: $19B+ global liquidations, with many alts down 5070% intraday, all triggered by <$100M of manipulated collateral. 5?? Whos at fault? Binance: design flaw + delay in oracle rollout = root cause. Exploiters: executed and timed the manipulation, profited via external shorts. Ethena (USDe): not at fault - protocol stayed 1:1 collateralized, redemptions normal, peg held everywhere else. 6?? Aftermath Binance admitted platform-related issues, promised compensation for affected margin/futures/loan users, and rolled out minimum price floors + oracle integration. USDe remained operational, and the incident is now a case study in how exchange-side pricing errors can trigger system-wide liquidations. Bottom line: A ~$90M dump on Binance and a $1.1B leveraged short elsewhere sparked a $19B bloodbath. Not a stablecoin failure, but a masterclass in exploiting flawed collateral valuation during peak macro stress.",2025-10-12 17:49:46,alexiskef,comment,ethereum,,Reddit,apparently happen copy pasta thing roughly usde binance wbeth bnsol exploit pricing flaw value collateral binance order book datum instead external oracle localize depeg trigger force cascade globally earn attacker short open hyperliquid hour early minute trump tariff announcement wasn usde failure binance design flaw macro panic trump tariff cover look like chaos actually coordinated exploitation binance internal pricing system amplify macro shock systemic leverage setup binance unified account let use asset like usde wbeth bnsol collateral instead oracle redemption binance value spot major vulnerability oct binance announce fix oracle base pricing rollout wasn oct leave window exploit window sophisticated actor manipulate binance order book usde drive binance unified account mark collateral internal instantly wipe margin value trigger force trump china tariff headline hit magnifying panic liquidity stress profit engine fresh wallet hyperliquid open short fund usdc arbitrum link binance cascade unfold cratere short net profit close timing precision funding path suggest coordination contagion binance alt thin book exchange mirror collapse cross bot maker hedge venue force unwind result global alt intraday trigger manipulated collateral fault binance design flaw delay oracle rollout root cause exploiter execute manipulation profit external short ethena usde fault protocol stay collateralized redemption normal peg hold aftermath binance admit platform relate issue promise compensation affected margin future loan user roll minimum floor oracle integration usde remain operational incident case study exchange pricing error trigger system wide line binance leverage short spark bloodbath stablecoin failure masterclass exploit flawed collateral valuation peak macro stress,0.193,0.675,0.132,-0.9485,negative,neutral

Leverage is a mechanism designed to make you sell at the worst possible moment at a terribly lower price. \- When staring at charts (we all do!), zoom out. Use weekly intervals, and most importantly, switch to log scale. \- Only invest what you can truly afford to lose. Dont try to time the market. Instead, make a deal with yourself to stay invested for a long time - no matter what. At least two full multi-year cycles, measured from bottom to bottom. \- Have a plan to take profits. Not all at once, but gradually, over time, especially when the market feels overheated. Acknowledge that this will be hard, because it means selling when sentiment is highest. \- And lastly, find something meaningful to do outside of crypto. Touch grass regularly.

c_njt91yk,"My thoughts. Sentiment in Crypto has taken a massive hit, primarily due to Trump, Binance (and others), as well as speculators who leveraged hundreds of millions through lets face it likely inside information. We now know that Crypto can crash on a tweet, and a bad tweet (worse than the China levies) could put things into a spiral. We can also see it is blatantly rigged. Think it demonstrated to many who were not aware and happily leveraged that the whole market is rigged, and not in their favour. With 1.5M wipeouts - it will take a long time to regain any confidence. A lot of those 1.5M will *never* return. Suspect real losses are FAR higher than the information available, perhaps even 50 billion, or more. Binance immediately offering a quarter of a billion dollars in 'compensation' makes me think how much did they make out of this? I have ZERO faith in them. I exited a 2X leverage that barely survived with a 40K loss - market has crawled up since then but I don't regret it. Have 100K (approx) unleveraged now in ETH and really thinking hard about what to do in the next few hours. Stable'ish at 4K but for how long. Yes, may drop to 2K, lose 50K, and yes, likely will come back.... but I will always realize now we are all one tweet away from anything happens. Too much uncertainty even for Crypto.

c_nk47a55,"The problem is that Cantor comparison applies to ETH but not to Ethereum. Ethereum is clearly holding the highest mind share of all options right now when it comes to tech and value. It's just that ETH is not as clear and the reason is likely related with high volatility, speculation and the ""cryptobro"" archetype. There is actually some intrinsic value to ETH: it's absolutely necessary to keep the network running (validators) to use the network (fees) and to access liquidity (DeFi collateral). Considering that running the network remains an appealing use case (30% staked, trending mostly upwards), usage of the network is increasing (ATH transactions, ATH blob usage) and liquidity keeps increasing (ATH TVL), ETH is a great position. Which leads to: how much of the current ETH valuation is speculative and how much are the facts above? To me, the facts above set a floor of 3K in fair market value for ETH (number I feel comfortable with, not based on any valuation model) if you remove all the speculation. But speculation can both push it below (in which case I will buy with both hands as long as intrinsic value remains true) or push it way up (300% overpriced is somewhat normal in a mania phase, so 12K is not unreal for crypto).

Bank of America estimated that at a $1T BTC market cap, just $93M of net buying could add around $1011B to its market value - a 118× multiplier. Applying that to ETH, moving from $4K to $10K would require a $726B increase in market cap, which at the same multiplier would mean only about $6B of net buying. But ETH might react even more sharply. Its market cap is smaller, and roughly 60% of supply is effectively illiquid - around 10.5% in ETFs and strategic reserves, plus \~29% staked. That could put ETH closer to a 200× multiplier, meaning only $34B of net open-market buying might be enough to trigger a run toward $10K.

c_njp6ce6,"Accumulation signals are all positive for the week: 1) We broke 17M exchange reserves on Sept 22. We broke 16M exchange reserves on Oct 8. That's just over 2 weeks later. A week after that we're already at 15.6M so on track to drop another 1M every 2-3 weeks. That's absolutely *wild* amounts of accumulation. 2) $19B in liquidations the other day but only about $700M of ETH ETF outflows. Clearly they aren't driving the drop. On Sept 15th ETFs had 6.7M ETH. Today they have 6.8M ETH. Meanwhile the price has dropped from $4500 to $4000. They're hodling while Web3 natives are noodle handing this. It's really embarrassing. 3) In the same timeframe DATs have acquired another 1.5M ETH. At todays prices that's around $6B of inflows in ~4 weeks. Over $1B a week of hard accumulation from committed never-sellers. $1B a week into an asset with a price elasticity of 10 should mean we're should be coiling up a 2% market cap expansion a week. By that logic if it wasn't for all the eager sellers we should already be 15% above our ATH just given the inflows since then. The spring may just be coiling for the next step function move like we had in July. I certainly hope it happens before EOY. Everything I can see still says money is flowing into the space and taking ETH in droves off weak handed web3 holders. It's just crazy how much ETH they seem willing to part with given all the hard signs of adoption: 1) YTD stablecoin market cap up almost 50% (~90B). Vast majority of that is on Ethereum. Tron of all things is losing market share. Tether regularly printing billions. 2) We now have 5 companies committed to bringing on tokenized equities. Starting in Sept we are seeing a rocket under the TVL on the already on-chain ones. We've gone from about $80M to $425M in a few short months. Most of these seems to be Ondo rather than Backed or xStocks. This is to say nothing of Robinhood or Blackrock's efforts which are not yet on chain but [sound like they will be substantial]( Of course the vast majority of TVL and volume is on Ethereum. Fink: ""I do believe we're at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets from real estate to all equities to bonds - across the board. There $4.1T in money sitting globally in digital wallets. A lot of that money is outside the United States. If we can tokenize an ETF, digitize it, we could have investors who are just beginning to invest in markets through crypto investing in the more traditional long term retirement products. We look at that as the next wave of opportunity for Blackrock over the next tens of years as we start moving away from traditional financial assets by repotting them in a digital manner and then having people stay in that digital ecosystem."" Interviewer: ""You weren't always a huge proponent of crypto."" Fink: ""Yeah but I grow and learn. 3) Speaking of Blackrock the BUIDL fund is up from $650M to $2.8B YTD and we've added a host of other on-chain treasuries from WisdomTree, Franklin, and Fidelity.

c_njntf26,"Hey everyone, special announcement that tomorrow's AMA is with James Craig, director of *Code is Law*, a documentary exploring cryptos most infamous smart contract hacks. **""Code is Law""** is a feature-length documentary exploring cryptos most infamous smart contract hacks - and the attackers who claim they broke no laws. Beginning with *The DAO* hack, it traces a lineage of exploits - from *Indexed Finance* to *KyberSwap* and *Mango Markets* \- where hackers argued that code, not law, should decide whats permissible. Told through the developers, investors, and investigators at the center of these cases, the film follows the pursuit of figures like teenage math prodigy Andean Medjedovic, who stole $65 million across two attacks and remains a fugitive from FBI charges. The film is streaming globally from October 21st via Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video and Vimeo on Demand.

c_njos184,"I watched a [DAT panel video]( yesterday from Token 2049 that was surprisingly worth the time. Bunch of alpha here that I'll summarize below: The mod asked what differentiated each DAT. 1) BitDigital launched some DeAI thing called WhiteFiber. Apparently they own most of it and they plan to use the revenue from it to acquire more ETH. BitDigital is also going the Microstrategy route of using unsecured debt to finance the purchase of more ETH. I also liked this quote: ""If Ethereum and Bitcoin were invented on the same day, you would never have heard of Bitcoin at this point."" 2) Lubin essentially said the link the Consensys was SBet's biggest strength. I don't personally buy this argument but the mechanism for this seems to be that SBet is planning to use ETH to stake and earn yield on Linea and to use the coming Metamask and Linea reward programs to incentivize behavior that benefits strategic investments Consensys is going to make. Obviously this means there's going to be a Metamask token so go farm your airdrops. 3) Bitmine carries around $600M in cash so they can proactively buy the dip of either ETH or BMNR. This explains how they just acquired about 400k ETH during the crash. After they acquire 5% of ETH supply they are going to focus investments in rails to accelerate the adoption of Ethereum by wall street. Tom Lee has described this before as kingmaking and I bet if they come to protocols with $1B of TVL they'll be able to negotiate some kind of bribe/kickback not available to common depositors. 4) The reason Bitmine is buying ETH like there's no tomorrow is they want to solidify their position as being the most liquid DAT and enter index funds like the Russel 1000 during the next rebalance in June 2026. This would make them eligible for investments from about 1500 large cap funds, essentially creating a flywheel of buy pressure on BMNR. This is also why they want to keep their balance sheet as clean as possible, it makes the story for the inclusion of BMNR in those indexes less complicated than if they had side business income like BitDigital or complicated debt like MSTR. They want to get that sovereign wealth fund bid into ETH via including BMNR in major indexes. He says this will pump their mNav to around 2. 5) BMNR has 30% institutional ownership and 330k retail holders. Arc funds from Cathie Wood is a top 10 holder. I'm surprised to hear that given some of her BTC maxi rhetoric in previous years. Tom Lee goes on for awhile about the importance of liquidity, volatility, implied volatility, etc and how critical this is for BMNR. He mentions several times how they're the 26th highest volume stock in the US and third highest volume stock in some other countries. I'm out of my depth to explain why this is but hopefully someone in here can help. Why is Ethereum being 50% more volatile than Bitcoin a good thing to institutions? What even is an implied volatility of 120? How do you monetize implied volatility in the way he's saying?",2025-10-15 22:00:22,LogrisTheBard,comment,ethereum,,Reddit,watch dat panel video yesterday surprisingly worth bunch alpha summarize mod ask differentiate dat bitdigital launch deai thing whitefiber apparently plan use revenue acquire bitdigital microstrategy route unsecured debt finance purchase like quote invent hear point lubin essentially link consensys sbet big strength don personally argument mechanism sbet plan use stake earn yield linea use come metamask linea reward program incentivize behavior benefit strategic investment consensys obviously mean metamask farm bitmine carry cash proactively bmnr explain acquire crash acquire supply focus investment rail accelerate adoption wall street tom lee describe kingmake bet come protocol tvl able negotiate kind bribe kickback available common depositor reason bitmine like tomorrow want solidify position liquid dat enter index fund like russel rebalance june eligible investment large cap fund essentially create flywheel pressure bmnr want balance sheet clean possible story inclusion bmnr index complicated business income like bitdigital complicated debt like mstr want sovereign wealth fund bid include bmnr major index mnav bmnr institutional ownership retail holder arc fund cathie wood holder surprised hear maxi rhetoric previous tom lee awhile importance liquidity volatility imply volatility etc critical bmnr mention high volume stock high volume stock country depth explain hopefully help volatile good thing institution imply volatility monetize imply volatility way,0.077,0.704,0.219,0.984,positive,neutral

A few minutes later all these tokens got burned again. Whatever happened here is a bit embarassing for Paypal, lets hope it just got fat fingered and nothing more nefarious is going on. Mint transaction: https:// etherscan.io/tx/0xc45dd1a77c05d9ae5b2284eea5393ecce2ac8a7e88e973c6ba3fe7a18bf45634 Burn transaction: https:// etherscan.io/tx/0xaa532ae7f06cccdbdc226f59b68733ae8594464a98e128365f8170e305c34f4b UPDATE: About 2 hours later 300 million PyUSD got minted into the paxos cold wallet. Really looks like someone fat fingered a mint transaction and accidentally added 6 zeroes to the transaction. Could also be that something went wrong using the decimals. For example the smallest unit of ETH is wei. 1 ETH is 10^18 wei. So, if you want to transact ETH you have to manually add 18 zeroes to the amount of ETH you want to transact. Wallets take care of that for you. Most ERC-20 tokens also have 18 decimals. Some exceptions are USDC and PyUSD which only have 6. So could be that this difference in decimals messed up the minting somehow. Here is the 300m minting transaction: https:// etherscan.io/tx/0x5b40975ea1326d1b48cb974d0fe1b8529b09a907c0a25833529e06cc60151abd",2025-10-15 20:45:00,haurog,comment,ethereum,,Reddit,minute trillion yes dollar stablecoin look like paypal accidentally mint pyusd paxos cold wallet minute later burn happen bit embarassing paypal let hope fat finger nefarious mint transaction etherscan eea ecce burn transaction etherscan xaa cccdbdc update hour later million pyusd mint paxos cold wallet look like fat finger mint transaction accidentally add zero transaction wrong decimal example small unit wei wei want transact manually add zero want transact wallet care erc decimal exception usdc pyusd difference decimal mess minting mint transaction etherscan abd,0.104,0.731,0.164,0.6124,positive,neutral

A month to two months later the DAT mania started. Tom Lee makes the statement that he wouldn't mind if ETH stays at 4k for an extended period of time so Bitmine could accumulate, although he didn't/doesn't think they'll get the opportunity to accumulate at 4k for very long. I think he said that some time in August. Lubin around that time, maybe in July said something like, over the last 3 or 4 years, the SEC and gov admin wasn't friendly to ETH and during that time a lot of ETH was produced and now is the time for DATs to ""sop"" up the supply. Today Arthur Hayes or rather yesterday, now says he sees eth at 10k this year (like 75 days to do it? - crazier things have happened) , Tom Lee stays firm on a higher EOY price and although Lubin has been quite lately on price predictions, we know he thinks ETH will go higher this year. News/podcasts/words-said in crypto time ages differently. A week feels like a month, a month feels like a year and so forth.

c_njmz4oh,"Where can I write articles about Bitcoin for 5BTC each? This new tech intrigues me, it's not much but it's at least enough money for groceries. Just some guy in \~2011. Only to create Ethereum afterwards. Interesting little fact right? Here is a big one: Sometimes we need to realign our minds to the original mindset of Ethereum and Bitcoin -> liberation. In a world where we face stagnating economies, mounting inequality, political corruption and the increasing monopolization of technology, we must try and fight against these growing forces. That's why we are building a weapon against it, called decentralization. This keyword should NOT and not even have the slightest form of weakness. This is why Ethereum exists how it exists today. Bitcoin is facing downfall, getting under control of few entities. The concept is mind blowing and powerful. But the execution is starting to crumble. The chain is facing to fail what it was designed to be, libre money! In a country that is build on the word freedom, we must create tools to fight the forces that try to control you. Not endorce powerfull hoarders to pump your gains. I spit on people like Sailor. He is not a good actor in this space! I spit on ETH reserves trying to hoard it. I spit on chains like BNB, SOL, ADA who only exist to gather money and grab control. Fuck Windows, libre Linux! Screw Nestle, get bent Facebook, up yours Tencent. Ethereum is the only chain that has liberation fighters at it's core working on it, from all around the world. Linux/GNU is a fine example of comparison, only at the software level. Trying to create value and get rich quick does not even cross their minds when developing on it. When people even try to control ETH, the power of decentralization forbids them for even trying. This is why I believe, and am strongly invested in Ethereum, because freedom is turning into something that will be scarce, and very necessary. Once I see the slightest form of change in this weapon and is losing it's original mindset, so that ETH can be controlled. I'm out. Once I see this weapon perfected and out of hands from everyone, even Buterin and the Foundation. we win!

c_nk0tzhn,"Every day I wake up and try to find a reason to sell my ETH and every day it gets harder smh.. The real goal, at least IMO, isnt about timing some exit or chasing a short term pamp. Its stacking these validators In this space, (CT in general, and here on Reddit) long-term holders often find themselves surrounded by traders obsessed with daily candles, and alot of that impatience starts to rub off. On the flip side, traders interact with long-term holders who bought in early or have more capital, and they start to feel envy or discouragement instead of inspiration. Both sides end up absorbing the others frustrations, and that psychological bleed affects everyones conviction (ethtrader to ethfinance daily and now to ethereum daily) Honestly, hodling BTC and waiting for TradFi to build products so pple can borrow against it or sell when their target is hit doesnt compare to becoming an ETH validator. Running a validator means earning yield while strengthening Ethereums foundation and aligning with its future, I'm preaching to the choir here but..you know, just thought it had to be mentioned. The PA right now is bittersweet. For new accumulators, its a gift stable, steady, and occasionally generous with dips to stack more. For earlier holders, its a test of patience they want their rewards to be worth more today (safe assumption). I get it. But when everything from road map development to institutional adoption (Tom Lee etc) is trending in the right direction, I honestly cant find anything wrong with the current price action besides people getting annoyed simply due to learned behavior, boredom etc. Theres nothing else like Ethereum on this planet.

Every cycle we have new what I call ""smug cults"" and other narratives that suck in newbies and take their ETH to pay for VC and KOL lambos. I've been in this market for a long time, I won the altcoin game in 17/18 and 20/21, swapped most of that to ETH and real estate and some stocks, really a diversified portfolio, now I am mostly chilling and buying dips because I believe in ETH. I also sometimes sell obvious tops, like last December. So much about my background. Back to newbies. When I look at X, I feel disgust, but they feel conviction. When there's tons of people acting rich and signing every tweet with ""Hyperliquid."" they think this is the next big thing, truth does not matter, FDV for what it is does not matter either. Solana, BNB scams, AI agents, perps, even NFTs to a degree (though still very ETH aligned back then), all of these are eternal liquidity drains on both BTC and ETH. I onboard friends, they slowly learn from me, but always there is this inflection point where they buy some shitcoin that goes 5x. They get the gambling bug, they get smug, they think I am a washed boomer. And who am I to blame them, I played alts back in the day. But back then there was less of an industry designed to mislead and drain newbies. I think the logic goes a bit like this. Crypto has kind of built this reputation of ""lol moon lambo doge meme"" culture instead of serious investments. Ethereum is one of the least degen trades in crypto, but people are here for massive upside and they are keen to find someone to tell them where they find that upside. So while people are always cautious upon entry, the second they make money they get bold and greedy.

c_nj2hkes,"I started trading a strategy on SOL with $28,000. Very strategically allocated funds and I am extremely stress-free. Predicting market direction or timing price swings isnt the only way to succeed. I follow a trading strategy that completely removes the need for forecasts or emotional decision-making. Instead of worrying about whether the market will rise or fall, this approach lets you accumulate more shares automatically whenever the price returns to specific value zones. In simple terms when the market dips, you actually *gain* more exposure to accumulate coins ,sell them at higher prices, rather than panic-selling. Over time, this method turns volatility from a threat into an ally. Theres no guessing, no rushing to catch trends, and no stress over daily news. You just follow the structure and let the system do its work buying more when prices are favorable and holding steady when theyre not.

We operate in a capitalist economy, where the U.S. and China together account for about 45% of global GDP. When the U.S. imposes a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, it disrupts both economies. The U.S. holds around 30% of the worlds wealth with only 4% of its population, meaning it is concentrated in a small fraction of hands. When policies are announced that could harm economic growth, investor sentiment turns bearish, leading to selloffs and a drop in the stock market.

For instance, if U.S. stocks fall 3%, many traders pull back from riskier positions.

c_njpcqjb,"Good question! Hopefully privacy was solved *before* Bhutan put their national ID system on Ethereum :) How I understand, 2nd generation ""digital ID"" solves the privacy issues, but is more complicated. The ""dumb"" (1st generation) works like you (or me) would come up with yourself, the central server has all info, and anyone verifying an ID simply verifies it to the central server. The problem is the central server has complete surveillance of how ID is used (not a problem with paper ID but a problem with digital). This is part of why so many are ""digital ID will enslave us all!!!"" (and they are right, from a certain point of view, but missing another point of view). The 2nd generation solves this, by that the user has their info, the user then generates proofs that are specific for the key of the company that verifies the user. This proof includes a ""trapdoor"" such that the company cannot leak the user's information, since they could have generated it themselves, nothing proves the user's key was involved. I do not understand the cryptography of this, I do not even understand elliptic curve cryptography (I do know RSA.... but I am very dumb on advanced asymmetric cryptography). So with this 2nd generation you solve all privacy concerns, as I understand.

c_njy7mw6,"Thanks! For most of my career I've been a TV producer making documentaries for the big networks here in the UK, but I left the industry to work independently and was on the look out for stories with my co-director, Louis. Louis knew a little about crypto and had been working with Aave on some of their tutorial videos, then when he attended EthCC got talking to Michael Bentley, the British founder of Euler Finance. Euler had just been though a $200m hack where they and a team of whitehats had scared the hacker into returning all of the lost funds (I believe it happened the day after Michael's first baby was born).

c_nhx6pn1,"Just to add from personal experience, the 40% headline is a really common trap for newer stakers; it refers to **validator commission**, not your yield. Always double-check that number before delegating. One thing Id also mention is that even when you stake with a safe validator, there are still a few risks that catch people off guard: * Validators can **raise commissions suddenly**, and most people never notice. * If they get **jailed or go offline**, your yield drops until you manually redelegate. * Rewards often **arent auto-compounded**, so you lose a bit of efficiency over time. After a few years of staking across different networks, I ended up using a system called **Polli** for my Cosmos delegations - it basically automates those things (tracks performance, redelegates underperforming validators, compounds automatically, etc.). Theyve been talking about launching on Solana before the end of the year, which I think could help simplify a lot of whats being discussed here. But in the meantime, for smaller amounts, Id say treat this as a learning experiment. Stake with 12 smaller reputable validators using a wallet like Phantom or Backpack, and just get familiar with how rewards flow and compounding works.

The foundation has the right to delegate to whoever they want with their SOL. Them being more selective to those who add value back into Solana is a net positive for SOL holders and the ecosystem. The reason why the foundation is making this change is now the cost to run a validator is becoming super affordable relative to what it has been. Now anyone can run a validator without needing to pay an enormous amount of money each day just to exist. This is because a certain mechanic of the chain no longer needs to write everything it does on chain. This is amazing and opens validating up to anyone that has the hardware. Something that's not even that costly when you compare chains like Ethereum which require 32 ETH to run a validating node. The hardware is the smallest cost. All in all, great changes are coming. Validator count will rise because the cost of running a validator is drastically lowering. However, some existing validators are upset because the foundation will no longer hand their votes to everyone just because they run a validator.

c_ni22kf9,"Its basically a souped-up ledger  I never planned to use it as my main device or a phone replacement. But for its purpose as a dedicated Web3 device, its excellent. Im not even logged into Google on mine; I strictly use it to interact with the Solana DApp Store. Ive only got three apps installed: the main wallet (built with Solflare), Jupiter, and Marinade. I fully agree with Merts point on X  they should drop the phone functionality entirely and make it a focused, high-end hardware wallet. That alone could shave a few hundred dollars off the price. If you preordered early enough, the airdrop totals came out to around $150, and during the initial founder window it was closer to $450  so in essence, you only paid about $300. Margins after that are probably razor thin. The last airdrop bonanza on the Saga was mostly thanks to Bonk, and I doubt well see a repeat of that. A lot of people seemed to think theyd make a killing off these, but for the price, the quality is totally fine.",2025-10-06 13:25:48,CosaNostra_MA,comment,solana,,Reddit,basically soup ledger plan use main device phone replacement purpose dedicated web device excellent log google strictly use interact dapp store app instal main wallet build solflare jupiter marinade fully agree mert point drop phone functionality entirely focused high end hardware wallet shave dollar preordere early total come initial founder window close essence pay margin probably razor thin bonanza saga thank bonk doubt repeat lot killing quality totally fine,0.12,0.683,0.197,0.7635,positive,neutral
