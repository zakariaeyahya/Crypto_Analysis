    "body": "Fusaka upgrade is coming to mainnet. In Yesterdays ACD Call it was decided that the upgrade will happen on December 3rd. The first blob increase (BPO1) will happen 6 days later on December 9th and the 2nd blob upgrade (BPO2) will happen on January 7th. \n\nCurrently each block can have a target of 6 and a maximum of 9 blobs. With BPO1 there will be a target/max of 10/15 in each block, with BPO2 it will be 14/21. This means will more than double the blob capacity until January. More space for scaling. Further increases of the blob counts will be decided at a later time. For the moment this is more than enough for some time to come. \n\nClient releases will come in the next few days. Most plan to release on Monday, as far as I understand, Prysm might be a few days late. Should be more than enough time to upgrade the nodes.\n\nThe most important part in this upgrade is PeerDAS which allows for scaling the number of blobs massively, while at the same time reducing the bandwidth and storage requirements for small stakers. There is also a minimum fee for blobs coming and some smaller changes tweaks which also allow scaling Ethereum mainnet. These new clients also push the gas limit to 60M gas on mainnet which is an increase by 33% to what we have now. \n\nMore details about the exact times when the updates will happen can be found here: https://notes.ethereum.org/@bbusa/fusaka-bpo-timeline\n\nMore details about what upgrades are coming in Fusaka can be found here: https://forkcast.org/upgrade/fusaka",

I went back to the La Golosineria, the candy shop with the Bitcoin Cash sticker in the window.   \n\nSo at the till, I asked the guy if it was true that you could pay with Bitcoin Cash and he was all yeah, course you can, no problem! But when it came to it, he wasn't really sure what to do. He was trying to generate a QR code, I think, and then asked an older woman for help.   \n\nShe had no idea. \"Can't you just pay with MercadoPago?\"   \n\n\"Yes, but I want to try this.\" She gave up on the whole escapade at that point but he was invested and got on the phone to someone, explaining that he had a customer that wanted to pay with Bitcoin Cash and now what?  \n\nHe asked me to scan the shop's QR code, with opened a screen confirming who I was about to transact with and asking how much I wanted to transact. I typed in 2,700 ARS and he said wait wait wait, don't send it yet! Then he spoke on the phone some more before confirming that the other person was ready and telling me, \"OK, now send it!\"   \n\nI submitted the tx and showed him on my screen that it had gone. He asked the person on the phone \"Did you get it? She sent it!\" And then the answer seems to have been yes, because he gave me my candy and told me all was good.   \n\nMy BCH haul:  \n\n* Pipas mini crack fuego  \n* Bull Dog regaliz, sabor sandia  \n* Spicy honey roasted mani desde el campo  \n\nIt's now safe to say that if I have to live off of crypto alone in Buenos Aires, I will not starve. \n\nI want to say that it was my first decentralised purchase without a middle man, but the guy on the phone was clearly talking to the person with the Bitcoin Cash wallet. So there was me and the BCH person and the lanky guy in the middle.  \n\nI'll keep trying.",

    "body": "[Yesterday, I shared my belief that AGI is coming soon](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ojqzls/daily_general_discussion_october_30_2025/nmai6ob/), and I got push back from several people with good points: /u/PlueOneRun, /u/tutamtumikia, /u/ProfStrangelove\n\nI wanted to carry this discussion forward because I think it's a very interesting topic for all of us. When I say, \"People in the know think AGI is coming soon,\" I stand by that. But let's see who those \"people in the know\" are - they're not typically AI researchers; of course, AI researchers look at transformers and say, \"That's a neat parlor trick, but it's not intelligence.\" The people who see AGI coming soon are the people with a broad view of science, technology, and futurology. These people see the long-term of effects of trends like Moore's Law and recognize that advanced technology contributes to even MORE advanced technology in a cyclical fashion. For all of the valid complaints about AI slop, there's also an incredible productivity boost from the application of current GPT technology. I'm not saying that GPT will magically evolve into AGI; I'm saying that current GPT technology will foster its development. As a final note, AGI isn't necessarily going to \"look\" human. If it's based on a fast lookup table but can still perform general intelligence tasks, it is STILL AGI. We're hung up on this idea that intelligence contains some magical spark of humanness, and we don't even know what makes that spark look real. The near-sighted view is that recent advancements are linear and expected, the long view respects the exponential growth of technology and the realization that we have to think in the exponential growth fashion while our brains tend toward linear vision. Seeing this potential reality doesn't mean I'm hoping for it and ignoring the consequences, it only means I'm approaching the future with a broad lens of possibility.",

Trump administration is already doing all they can to help crypto (GENIUS Act, national crypto reserve, pardoning Zhao, etc.), yet they're unable to even keep Bitcoin price above $110K.\n\nThe flipside of the administrations \"flood the zone\" shit is that any individual action they take has only a miniscule impact on price, especially because the price even right now relies on the HODLers assuming that the administration will do pretty much everything plausible to help the industry.

    "body": "I’m genuinely intrigued to see how this unfolds. I consider myself a Bitcoin maximalist. Although I’ve followed the technology closely for over a decade... my master’s degree focused on engineering and cryptography around 2010... I didn’t begin accumulating Bitcoin in significant amounts until a few years ago. That said, I have never sold a single satoshi, nor do I ever intend to. My approach is simple: I only buy. Every two weeks, no matter the price. This won't change for a couple more decades. I'm already at the point where I don't need to work... I do what I want, and my hobbies produce enough to live on and continue to accumulate.\n\nI know others who share this conviction. My goal is not short-term gain but long-term preservation... my intention is to pass this wealth on to my children and grandchildren. I view Bitcoin as an inevitable successor to fiat currency. When people ask, “How can you live on Bitcoin?” or “What good is it if you never sell?” they miss the point entirely. To me, Bitcoin represents protection against the erosion of value... an anchor in an increasingly unstable financial system.\n\nI have no objection to borrowing against my holdings if needed, but I would sooner part with almost any other asset before selling Bitcoin. It doesn’t take a large number of people with this mindset for the circulating supply to effectively disappear. Even if Bitcoin reached $10 million per coin tomorrow, my philosophy wouldn’t change. The volatility lies not in Bitcoin, but in the fiat systems that measure it. Bitcoin is the constant... the foundation... amid a world of shifting valuations.\n\nI welcome pullbacks, I don't mind price surges. It's all noise to me. I know I'm going to die with between 5-25 BTC either way, its just a matter of how many I have. My life between now and then is more than provided for with that as an asset to borrow against. The only question is... how many others are doing the same... because the faster that picks up, the lower end of that total I'll make it to. Again, doesn't matter what price in fiat BTC gets to... security is in grabbing a piece of this pie, and letting it grow for you. The number of BTC isn't your growth... holding what you have is. Selling BTC is giving up your future castle... and security.",

    "body": "Indeed... time preference is the most valuable lesson one can learn from Bitcoin... everyone wishes they hadn't tried timing entry/exit 5-10 years ago. They all wish they had just accumulated, and sat on it - borrowed from it to live (the way the rich do it, buy borrow die - passing generation wealth to their kids tax advantaged). This pattern will persist forward as BTC marches towards an inevitable $300-500T valuation in our lifetimes.\n\nI have four children, and over time my Bitcoin holdings will be distributed among them. Eventually, all Bitcoin will be distributed... generation by generation... but right now we have a golden opportunity to set not only ourselves, but our descendants, on a path toward lasting financial security. I think few really sit back and appreciate just how powerful even having 0.1 BTC will be a couple decades from now. More powerful than 10 would seem to us today (while we wish we had caught on earlier)... I'm sure.\n\nWhat many people overlook is the sheer scarcity of this asset in a global context. With an estimated 10 billion people projected to inhabit the Earth by 2050, that equates to only about 0.002 BTC per person if Bitcoin were evenly divided. But it won’t be. Once you account for the millions of coins already lost, and the substantial portion that will likely end up locked within corporate treasuries, institutional portfolios, and sovereign wealth funds... potentially encompassing half to three-quarters of the total supply... the amount truly available to individuals shrinks even further.\n\nIn realistic terms, owning 0.0005 to 0.001 BTC may one day represent the equivalent of an average share of global productivity and wealth... forever. That’s the scale of opportunity before us now. Few understand how profoundly asymmetric this moment is.\n\nThe point I think most eventually come to when they reach maxi level is that the time preference to the future, and your plan to keep and secure a piece of this pie, instead of using it to try and buy in and sell out... is what distinguishes those who will have set their family apart for generations, and those who wish they had, when 0.001 BTC was attainable...\n\nNo doubt, in twenty years, people will look at what we are doing today with 0.05 BTC ... the same way we look at what people were doing with 100 BTC 10 years ago... \"Why would they have sold all of it!?! if they had just kept it, just imagine\"",

When you do crypto things on your computer and you need to sign a transaction or whatever, you plug in your hardware wallet and it will use your private key without your computer being able to see it. No hackers can see it. No virus can see it. \n\nThat is the \"reason\" to get a hardware wallet.\n\nTo protect against hardware failure, you also keep a paper backup of your seed phrase (which you keep very safe and should not need to access).\n\nYes, you can store multiple wallets on the one hardware device but check with the manufacturer which ones they support.",

    "body": "I know that the bystanders are sitting around dunking on age so let me tell you I’ve been in Crypto for 13 years.\n\nThis sub Reddit is a very pro hardware wallet area. \n\nI’m very much against them because they have a proven track record of being a single point of failure. Using a back up seed phrase on a secure physical object, like paper or metal is the safest way. \n\nLet me share some of the issues I’ve come across regarding people and their hardware wallets:\n\n1. Someone had infected malware on their PC that intercepted the handshake on connection of hardware wallet.\n\n2. Someone’s button stopped working, and when they opened it up to repair it, they shorted out the memory chip and lost everything.\n\n3. Someone got their hardware wallet and password/phrase stolen while on vacation.\n\n4. Someone got caught in the rain and the device shorted out.\n\nIn these instances, it was all based around the physicality of the device. Remember, you are choosing to store all of your savings on some thing that can be broken in many different ways and even physically stolen.\n\nThen there are the external forces around owning and using hardware wallets that I am just not down with:\n\n1. User data has been compromised multiple times by a hack on one of the top hardware wallet makers. They got names and email addresses and any information that they user had on the site. There was then a coordinated campaign to phish these people. Scores of people fell for it and ended up losing everything on their hardware, wallets and web wallets.\n\n2. If you don’t buy directly from the manufacturer than you are risking purchasing a compromised device with a hidden back door, that can be triggered at any time. There are even websites set up to look like the authentic ones in hopes that you will buy one of their compromised devices. There are many stories of someone purchasing a trezor off of Amazon or eBay only to find that it had been tampered with.\n\n\n\nAnyways, it’s your life do what you want",

So for the balance of the year? No you wouldn't have beaten inflation.\n\nIf you're looking to hold BTC long term, and expect it to appreicate to $200,000 or higher, then holding it now doesn't matter. But you **could also** sell BTC, as it falls towards April, cycle into gold or silver as it rises, then sell silver and buy BTC again when you think the next BTC bottom is hit.\n\nTiming the market is exceptionally hard, and not recommended, but that doesn't mean you should hold BTC through its down cycles 'just because.'",

    "body": "If you want the real honest answer, it's because the thinking is that dApps are going to replace everything when in reality they won't. Blockchains vs Centralized databases are a tradeoff between performance and counter party risk. Blockchains were invented to deal with the issue regarding property rights in a digital world. However people want performance and usability, and if a centralized database solves that problem more efficiently than a blockchain, then people are going to stick with the centralized database.\n\ndApps have their use, especially when it comes to digital property rights, acting as a neutral layer for internet payments, etc. However just creating a dApp for the sake of the dApp doesn't solve anything. There needs to be a value add (like reducing friction or counter party risk, gaining agency or property rights, or transparency) for the dApp to gain traction. This is the reason why stablecoins, specifically regarding access to the US dollar has exploded, as accessing and transacting with the US dollar through traditional finance has been very difficult especially outside of the US.",

    "body": "A few things that I've seen in the last 6m-ish being immersed in a community (in gaming) that is targeting both existing crypto users and onboarding new users. In my opinion:\n\n\\- There's currently no incentive to build a sustainable business because building gambling services / moonshots (perps, memecoin launchpads, new \"revolutionary\" L1s, etc) generates far more money in the short term (either through revenue or VC or pump-n-dump). Software is expensive to build - so sound startup decision-making leads you towards building whatever brings in money in the short term. The result of this is that anyone building crypto projects tend towards building these types of projects.\n\n\\- A large number of very vocal people have a pretty big hatred of crypto as a whole. They view it as a den of scammers and thieves. This impacts the reach of dapps to successfully build products for normal people.\n\n\\- The businesses that crypto-native alternatives would be most likely to disrupt are pretty good at what they do - or they have massive network effects which is hard to disrupt without being 10x better.\n\n\\- Smart contract hack risk.\n\n\\- Bad marketing (most of the target audience for dapps do not actually care if you have a \"permission-less\" *anything*, so stop marketing that as a differentiating feature).\n\n\\- Onboarding *still* sucks - though it's much, much better than it was 1-2 years ago with things like L2s, seedless onboarding, EIP-7702 and user ops, onboard direct-to-L2, etc. For devs - this is pretty difficult to actually implement since there's lots of complexity inherent and knowledge requirements to get into this. There are various decent-ish options to onboard people to crypto but they all come with trade-offs (example: Coinbase onramp = fee-less onboarding to USDC, but then you're stuck building on top of USDC and the cognitive burden of migrating your users away will be a risk to your business in the future).\n\n\\- Hesitance towards crypto for tax complexity reasons (especially amongst Europeans). No user of Steam (as an example of a marketplace for digital goods) is worried about the burden of filing taxes associated with buying video games. Because there's no way to bypass that issue with crypto - non-crypto-native users are rightly hesitant about maintaining a crypto balance of any type for any reason.",

Because they did their research and got in early, And that’s “dealers choice” so they say. If you personally want to invest in Microsoft and jump on the bandwagon and invest conservatively have at ‘er. Not everyone is going to invest in the same way as we all have different personalities, goals and knowledge about a particular asset. I wouldn’t invest in a company I see flopping, but there is always *always* going to be unpredictability aspect to investing stocks… even if you choose Microsoft. World could be Nuked tomorrow,  could die in a car accident, could end up with a dictator one world government that doesn’t allow us to even invest in stocks. My point being, if someone believes in an asset like XRP for one example, and does their research thoroughly and isn’t just jumping on a bandwagon to say “why no lambo” when they don’t 500x in a month, and has patience, no it’s not “pointless”. It’s more of a risk. But there’s a reason why when you go to a bank they ask you if you want to invest in a conservative way or are you willing to put more money on the line for a potentially bigger return? And will you be OK financially if that doesn’t happen? Do you have all your eggs in one basket or are you diversified?",

The funneling back and forth between FTX, Alameda and their various political contributions, sponsorships, etc. is where it got lost. Took a while but they found it all and then some. If you ultimately look at the bankruptcy settlement, the creditors all made money above their initial investment which is completely unheard of in a bankruptcy settlement. (That means they were profitable). Additionally, FTX US was also profitable and a separate entity and was still rolled into the bankruptcy via bad legal advice along with signing the FTX and Alameda over. Truly the whole thing was rushed and he received awful advice.\n\nNow ultimately, was it his own fault for hiring unqualified people that were in way over their heads - yes. Was it his own fault the money couldn’t be found because of how disorganized they were - yes. Did the creditors get paid back their investment and then some - yes. So, does he deserve to spend his life in prison? He screwed up for sure but I would say no.\n\nEdit: Here is a link to the book if anyone is interested.
