    "body": "This isn't the first Trump presidency when crypto existed.\n\nWhat changed from the last presidency is that we now have crypto native cabals, funds, etc., leveraging his presidency to mass extract. I will say it again. Trump has been Trump forever. He is basically pay-to-play; we all know this.\n\nHe is probably the most well-known ***constant*** in this cycle. I told you all he is going to make a mess over trade. But all I got was gaslighting from this sub. Again, Trump is the most OPEN BOOK CONSTANT FACTOR OF THIS CYCLE!\n\nWhat is different? We learned this space's hierarchy, VCs, devs, leadership, etc. are unafraid and unabashed to USE Trump to farm the retail crowd. It was NOT WAGMI. It is full-on PVP between retail and all the native elite interests. The biggest lie we were told is those who are in crypto should be afraid of the Fed and TradFi. No, our worst enemies are within this space with deep entrenched interests. They want to destroy your wealth, rather than to help you build wealth.\n\nOver time, we are all slowly realizing retail's interests aren't aligned with the leadership in this space. It is worse than TradFi in many ways.\n\nEdit: Keep coping and sucking up to the space extractors.  If you want to downvote me, why not provide an argument?",

He is just not pushing it. He just dont wanna touch the issue and leave it for states.\n\nIn comparison, kamala's campaign included an mobile abortion clinic. The issue mentioned in on every speech.\n\nSo in comparison with her, dude looks anti-abortion.\n\n------\n\nOk now back to crypto: democrats are filled with SO MANY anti-crypto senators. Now at the same time, there are couple of repunlicans quite vocal in being pro-bitcoin, although most  are just stay away from the issue.\n\nBiden's era also gave us a lot of anti crypto rulings:\n2022 Executive Order on Digital Assets\nSEC enforcement\n, through regulators like the FDIC, has pressured banks to disengage from crypto-related businesses, limiting access to traditional financial services.\nTax reporting rules:\nMining tax proposal\n\nNow.. based on that... during election time... in comparison with biden era, trump /republican in general seemed to be more pro crypto.\n\n-------\n\n\nAgain. All in comparison. Cos US only have 2 political parties",

If it hits a certain point, it’ll start a snowball effect of lots of people being forced to automatically buy bitcoin, raising the price, triggering more stop losses, raising the price etc etc. \n\nSo yeah, good for hodlers (if the price rises a bit first to set off the chain reaction)",

It's just that I have family who depend on me which makes me consider more before getting into this sort of thing. Also, what's the purpose of this community if we are not asking questions and helping each other? Like is this social media invented only for sharing funny memes?!

Industry leading liquid staking is battle tested and proved now. Superb security on Smart contracts. Fair distribution and wide base of ADA holders. First partner chain coming soon with Midnight which will open up privacy use cases.\n\nIOG are a solid performer, albeit a little slow at points. Not gonna argue that the Foundation and Emurgo are performing at the levels expected and needed though. Nor that there has not been a history of over promising.\n\nBut it’s fine to tune out and relax. Cardano will deliver. Lots of regulatory headwinds and a very adversarial environment do not help. However there are signs that is improving.\n\nLastly this market cycle is all about transferring ownership to Wall Street at the lowest possible cost. Don’t get shaken out.",

Personally, I'm more optimistic than ever about Cardano. There's significant development happening behind the scenes. Saying it's \"gone quiet\" doesn't reflect what's really happening in the ecosystem. Building this kind of technology is incredibly complex, and no one else is approaching it quite like Cardano. We can't just copy Ethereum, because they're the ones taking ideas from us.\n\nIt's understandable to feel impatient, but it's also important to recognize that real progress takes time. If this subreddit is your main source of information, you might miss updates happening elsewhere. Charles often shares detailed insights and plans in his livestreams, and they're a great way to stay current on what's being built. There are also many community members and influencers providing regular updates about ongoing developments.\n\nFor example, [Hydra v1.0.0 has already been launched](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/1o29il6/hydra_100_prerelease_a_big_release_of_hydranode/), and Ouroboros Leios is in active development around the clock by global teams working in shifts to hit the 2026 target.

Selling cardanos capabilities seems to be an afterthought or not being pitched at the right level (which is why I’d say avoid the techno babble).

But…none of the shop spaces have anything in them and no one is shopping there. It needs better advertising and dapps that people want to use and come back to. Defi is aweful on cardano because it’s slow. On other chains it feels more fluid and has significantly better liquidity. Yes chains come and go but a lot of the things cardano was supposed to help (banking the unbanked in Ethiopia etc) have not remotely materialised. Promises of when things would release like SC back in 2021 just had delay after delay. People are fatigued by that continuing to happen. The old slow and sure is putting people off because all that’s happening is cardano slips further and further behind in adoption stakes. The tech isn’t speaking for itself otherwise adoption would be greater. \n\nAnd Absolutley price is important because it’s a metric of how much faith people have in its future.  People speculate on a future but the price of cardano has struggled to even get to $1 and sitting around 60c is embarrassing when you see other top 10 tokens being close to or reached ATH. VC support and big business are required to help with growth but who is actually getting after that. The build it they will come attitude has failed and a new direction or rebirth is required.

    "body": "Nah… this only works if there is traffic on solana paying priority fees. If toly can get pumpfun or someone else to make something that’ll sustain the current fees it’ll work out .. but they are printing 4% sol and if usage doesn’t stay where it’s at or higher everyone will be underwater. Short term it’s gonna fly but if anything happens (say a 50% decline in usage and price) they are gonna windowjump and sol will head down to 30-50 bucks. They didn’t win the western union deployment .. stellar did the same thing years ago and I think jed actually bought moneygram. Stellars whole thing was remittances and solana adopting the same playbook tells me they are much more confident than they should be. Be prepared for mid jan cause it’s gonna get rough.",

It has an extremely high market cap. You will see idiots on here talking about other coins outperforming bitcoin.. Do not listen to them.. Bitcoin is clearly on top by every measurable standard. Highest price, highest market cap. Bitcoin is capped at 21M supply, unlike others which can just be minted for no reason. So yeah, stick with bitcoin for the longterm investments.
