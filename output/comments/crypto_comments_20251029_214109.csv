A few practical notes (for anyone who might hit this jackpot too):

* Security first: don‚Äôt share TXIDs, addresses, or your exact setup. Expect DMs from ‚Äúhelpers.‚Äù Ignore them.
* Cold storage: move proceeds to a hardware wallet you control (fresh addresses); consider a passphrase/multisig if it fits your threat model.
* Coinbase maturity: for solo miners reading along, a coinbase reward normally needs 100 confirmations before it‚Äôs spendable. If you used a pool payout, the pool handles this.
* UTXO hygiene: label what‚Äôs what, avoid address reuse, and split large UTXOs thoughtfully if you‚Äôll make future spends.
* Taxes: set aside the tax portion now, and speak with a qualified tax pro. Estimated payments can help avoid penalties.
* Cash-out plan: if you‚Äôre paying off the mortgage, stage conversions rather than one big sell; minimize slippage and keep records for your accountant.
* If you don‚Äôt want to sell: some folks prefer to **borrow against BTC** to access liquidity while keeping exposure. If that‚Äôs your route, do due diligence on rates, LTVs, margin call policies, and custody. Xapo Bank offers this option as well for qualified members.

Enjoy the win, you earned it. But of course, none of this is financial advice...

In all seriousness though, the ability to make money off the then-incoming obvious crypto grift does not make Trump a ""crypto president"" any more than the ability to make money off the then-incoming obvious stock market grift makes Trump a ""business president"".

More clearly: manipulating something for personal gain does not make you an advocate for, or ally of, that something. It makes you a parasite -- which (by definition) is inherently antagonistic/predatory.

And not for nothing...but those easy gains would be pretty hollow and pointless if, say, the spectacular level of Trumpist corruption we are currently witnessing leads to an over-correction from regulators that suffocates the industry.

Kinda like how if all the money I made shorting DJT at IPO is in USD, and if Trump's group of regards do something even dumber than expected (like default on the debt, kill Fed independence, etc.), my savvy ended up worthless.

Or, let's say you're a woman. Or a brown person. Or an atheist. Or a liberal. Or a Liberal. How many degrees of freedom do you think you'll have with your accumulated wealth when the far-right Christian Nationalists have fully consolidated power? I'm guessing less than preferred.

So unless you took crypto profits in USD and then converted to Euros and Monero, I'd examine your risk exposure more carefully. How does that expression go? Counting chickens does not yield a time-independent result?

Back then when experts, financial modelers, economists and tech guys looked at it and were considering its implications it was $2m per BTC and that was way back then during times close to conception before like <150 to 35k. Why I asked the sages here is as per my humble observation is might it be higher or lower because we measured it against the market and looked at it as a store of value asset like gold for example. Though the thing is its utility is extremely far reaching, example in space travel for example we now have something we could use for remittance (and that is crypto). Well unless something changes in our timeline... we'll see.

My reason for asking is we knew the upper limit back then based on 1 factor but now with all these other factors I wonder... isn't it a little too undervalued? Makes me wonder all the time.

Thanks for your amazing input, let me re-analyze things.

Edit: So basically if you factor in the inflation, assets backed by btc, owners & wallets, population and global gdp and things I mentioned in my previous comment the amount should be much higher but also the factors you talked about made me rethink about other discoveries and interesting possibilities too (coming from a long time enthusiast)

Edit2: That was it from a utilitarian point of view as it combines all the features of money and tech into 1 thing. As you said too things can go the other way so please do ignore this rumbling and just look at it as a discussion

Edit3: The idea was that 1 BTC was 100,000,000 SATs and what people will use was SATs when the time came or something, I don't know I forgot it was been a very long while since I last looked into it (and if you put things into that perspective it makes you rethink the value and all too)",3,False,,t1_nlw2myh,5

It's some sort of similar bs. He's trying to remove suspicions, I will only believe it's pure coincidence if he loses his entire winnings made from the winning short few days ago.

Also, if some day he wants to cash out and they find his identity and he gets sued, his lawyer will be able to show many small loses so his account can look like an ordinary trader account,  since if there are only winnings he will lose the case.

And we already have his identity lol

1. Forgive yourself.
You failed because you are human. Even the most disciplined investors fall into the trap of ‚Äújust one exception‚Äù when life gets difficult. Shame is a heavy weight, and it clouds decision-making.

2. Build a foundation.
Cash may not be exciting, but it gives you breathing room. Three to six months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account or money market fund can make all the difference.  


3. Reconsider 100% btc.
Putting 100% of your capital into a single asset, no matter how strong your conviction,  exposes you to existential risk. You don't have to give up on Bitcoin. But maybe next time, it's 50% BTC, 30% in broad equities, 20% in bonds or cash.  


4. DCA.
After what happened, it's natural to want to be more careful  before putting money back in. But I want to be honest with you: waiting for a specific price like 90k can quietly turn into another trap.

4. Leveraging.
If you want to accelerate growth, look into investing in skills that enhance your earning potential

I wanted to take a moment to share my observations regarding the current state of the market. I sense that there may be a significant uplift at the end of this month, particularly for those who have been closely monitoring the trends. It appears that we are currently experiencing the third dip of the month, and historically, such patterns often precede notable recoveries.

While I am not a market specialist or any kind of professional, my personal analysis leads me to believe that we are on the verge of an upward trajectory that could be unprecedented. This is simply my opinion based on what I have been observing.

I felt it was important to articulate my thoughts, as I believe this potential shift could be of interest to you and others who are navigating the market.

Speculation arose about insider trading, but some argue the pardon was predictable due to CZ's significant investments. Former BitForex CEO Garrett Jin denied involvement in the trades.

I ran into one of my old friends who I had previously helped purchase 10 BTC (and I once sold a Casascius coin to back in 2014) earlier this year. He said, ""I wish I would have bought coin back when you told me to!""

When I told him he did buy coin and I helped him do it he shook his head and laughed. 

""Yeah, but I sold all those about a year later after it fell in price."" 

He meant he should have listened to me and bought it again when I mentioned it again on my social media in like 2017. I told him he could still buy Bitcoin today, but he said it's too expensive.

Some people are just not meant to be Bitcoiners. They have a ""victim of circumstance"" demeanor when it comes to their finances. They follow trends, never set them. They talk about things they see on the news, and never seek knowledge from the original sources. They have next to no understanding of value, nor do they have the saving mindset. I don't think they even possess the capability to change into a saver's mindset, either.

There's an old adage that you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. I used to think the adage was just a cute saying, maybe something relating to people who are good at something not realizing they have a knack for it. I realized that day what it really meant...

It means that most of what we teach each other is ignored. Very few people actually seek out knowledge or have a desire to learn more and more, as much as they can about the world and their place in it. Or they hear it and for whatever reason they don't process it. 

They'll go visit some new location but they are there for the ""experience"", because they saw a Youtube video or streamer talk about the place, or they heard about a vacation there from a friend, not actually to learn about whatever the tour guide tells them or to actually understand the struggles of the locals or the history.

These are the same people that give you a blank stare when you talk about how you have 15 tabs of Wikipedia open on your browser right now, or their eyes glaze over when you talk about a new technology that you are messing around with and the struggles you are having implementing software changes on the newest hardware. When you start talking about the history of money, they fall asleep.

You can hold the cup of knowledge right against some people's lips, and just like the horse, unless they are actually thirsty, they aren't going to drink it.",14,False,,t3_1oht3fd,0

Seriously? Do we really need to freak out every time Bitcoin hits? A milestone and by the way, this isn't even a milestone. This is not an all-time high. 

But like say it does hit 125k. Is that really worth celebrating??

That's $1,000 higher than its previous all-time high. Why don't we get excited when it gets to 150 ?

Not to mention every time this subreddit goes bananas over a very slight uptick. What happens we get a sell-off..

If noone is willing to buy more when the price keeps going lower at a fast pace it won't stop dumping. Liquidations occur and it spirals to even lower levels. But who is willing to buy when shit is going down quick? Let me ask you, what are your first thoughts if you see a flush like that happening real rime? Because if it's not "" let me deposit my investing money and buy that shit up"" you are the reason for it going lower. Zero sum game. Someone has to be willing to buy when there is blood on the streets. 
Are you going to be the one to enter a volatile market with your hard earned money? Probably not. So don't cry if someone else is entering at like all time lows on some alt. You can enter yourselves. But you all look at these events like crypto is a scam and shit. No it is very decent and quick way to take the money from dumb people by the smarter people. Market making works with few million dollars on leverage, you don't need billions like on nasdaq. 

Precise traders can make quick money every day. Even I had a short on NQ before the dump was happening and I'm not even a profitable trader. Listen to price action. Any news is a straight up lie or manipulation. The only thing that can't lie is price. Some traders in the group I belong to made shorts on crypto an hour before the dump started. Don't you think professional traders won't catch up? They see shit before it happens and its all spiraling into price falling quick. As if more people enter a short they are helping this to happen.

Its not manipulation by trump, news accelerate the process but price action traders see it before happening. It is YOU people that make it happen by stupid decisions, bad stoploss placements, high leverage, using the whole account etc. You give the market a selling pressure shock which immediately turns into high level liquidations which can't be stopped unless someone big is willing to buy.

Thats like saying theres a bunch of gold clones because silver, platinum, etc. 

2. Why does something need to be tangible to have value? For example you can buy the rights to something. The ""thing"" may be tangible but not the right to it.
What about stocks? Sure the company has assets that are tangible but there is more to the value of the stock than the companies tangible assets.
What about a bank account with, say, 10k in it? I would argue that is intangible but has value. Sure I can take the 10k out of the account and trade it for 10k cash and thats tangible, but i can also trade 0.1btc for 10k cash.

That's not so much about him making money as him thinking a higher market means people will love him.

Anyway, Trump isn't uniquely corrupt in this aspect, many of our politicians make absolute bank with straight up insider trading. Almost every President has come out of the position substantially richer. Obama 100x'd his net worth since taking office. Most of it was after office, but his campaign and presidency definitely didn't hurt his book sales.

What Trump's doing with crypto is pretty shady, but it's not technically breaking the law right now. I think it's not as bad as some of the lawmakers that buy calls on something they are about to fund with a bill though. The people buying his crypto are willingly doing it and it has nothing to do with him using policy to manipulate it persay, just his enhanced credibility as the Pres... but he'd probably still have made a killing even if he did it between his terms.",1,False,,t3_1oaxsiz,0

1nwx073,cryptocurrency,nhjby7h,MonsieurReynard,2025-10-03T13:43:59,"Not really. Maintenance on a NYC co-op tends to be about $1000/month per million of valuation in a fully staffed building (‚Äúdoorman‚Äô‚Äù building). That includes taxes and building costs as well as a lot of staffing labor costs.  Assuming a five million dollar apartment, which is how I got to $5000, $60k a year in maintenance inclusive of property taxes is probably about right in my own experience. 

A friend of mine has a SoHo coop apartment  worth about 1.8 million in a  fully staffed (24/7 doorman, live-in super, porters, handymen, cleaning staff) and they pay about $2k a month in maintenance.

For those unfamiliar with NYC real estate, ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù is a term that doesn‚Äôt just mean fixing stuff. It‚Äôs a fee you pay to the co-op association you‚Äôre a member of to cover building staff (doormen, porters, handymen, super) and all upkeep of the actual building, like facade repair and roof replacement costs. (You can also be hit with ‚Äúassessments‚Äù for major building repairs over and above  monthly maintenance.)  Maintenance also covers property taxes, which is  large piece of it, building insurance, and any mortgage servicing costs on the building itself (beyond the apartment).

The fancier the building, the more expensive the maintenance is as a percent of valuation. Full time doormen and porters are unionized and make good money. A coop with a full time 24/7 building staff easily spends a million or more a year in benefits, taxes, and wages.

I‚Äôm guessing a multimillion dollar 5th Avenue penthouse is in a fully staffed building. If the building has 50 units, that‚Äôs a couple grand per unit per month right there.

I‚Äôll try to pop over to streeteasy and see what maintenance is on five million dollar coops these days. It‚Äôs not a search I‚Äôm usually doing lol.

High end NYC real estate is wild. The numbers are insane.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm laughing, these boys think ten million net worth is ‚Äú5th Avenue Penthouse and Hamptons weekends‚Äù *rich*!these days. That‚Äôs an upper middle class retirement account for NYC finance bros and lawyers and such. 

Edit: Lol downvoted for knowing what I‚Äôm talking about.  Ok here you go. This is a 2BR/2ba coop in a fully staffed building on  5th Ave in Greenwich Village. On a lower floor, no less. For sale for 3.4 million bucks right now.  Monthly maintenance is listed as $4612 a month. 

https://streeteasy.com/building/51-5th-avenue-new_york/2bf

I got my middle-class ass out of living in NYC years ago and live in the woods these days.  As the old saying goes, (I think it was Hemingway), ‚Äúthe rich are different than you and I, they have more money.‚Äù

And yeah that doesn‚Äôt even begin to include parking lol. Downtown, typically that‚Äôs another $2-3k a month to have a garage spot. And that‚Äôs for the $100k Land Rover you only use for those weekend trips to the Hamptons, hence those big Uber Black bills. Heck, you gotta pay a $9 ‚Äúcongestion pricing‚Äù toll  every time you enter Manhattan below 60th st now and on top of whatever bridge or tunnel toll you paid to get there.
 
There‚Äôs well off. And there‚Äôs rich. In NYC in 2025 ten mil in the bank does not  make you ‚Äúrich‚Äù by local standards. It‚Äôs a world unto itself.  Lower Manhattan in particular is a tough place to be middle class, let alone poor.",12,False,,t1_nhj9jx6,2

I thought you were gonna go somewhere else with this post. Manipulation doesn't matter as long as it overall keeps trending up. I guess you can say it's always been manipulated all that's changed is who the whales are. 

This is what matters:

In 10 years, conservative estimates put bitcoin at 1mil. From 100k, that's a 10x gain. So if you do a leverage play like you did... $20k x 10 goes up to ... wait for it ... $200k.

My issue with your post is that you are implying that when you bought on credit, it was safer (for various reasons you list in your post) than today. That is vastly wrong. BTC is a brutally volatile asset and it was like that back in 2015 as well as today. In 2011 BTC crashed 94% from $32 to $2, in 2013-2015 it crashed by 85%, in 2017-2018 by 84%, 2022 by 77%, so no matter when you bought it, and at what price, you still could face a huge drawdown... If you buy on credit and have no other means to repay the credit than using the proceeds from your investment (for example borrow money to buy BTC but use your salary to pay the loan back while letting your BTC grow, then you can get wiped out any time. With BTC you have two options to deal with its volatility: wait it out (which few people can stomach) or set yourself internal safety brakes where you get out no matter what to protect the principal (which few people can handle either, usually they end up buying high and selling low). But there are methods to peg your trades to volatility metrics and trade them using BTC.

This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.

Realest statement I have read. But I think the old strategy is now the only strategy if you want to invest in Bitcoin; stack sats and hodl. Unless you're privy to their algos you won't beat them in timing or swing trading so holding long term is the only play now imo. Also, pull BTC off the exchanges when possible. Exchanges are now part of the traditional financial system and may have incentive to rehypothecate your Bitcoin. One big power in BTC is that it is limited supply, don't let institutions control that supply for their own benefit.

Even Saylor and MSTR may be part of the overarching problem.

Not trying to be a down Debby here at all just wanted to share that even us who were beat, still have faith in BTC

You guys that held are legends and congrats! U deserve the freedom btc provides.

May BTC and Satoshi bless you and your families for generations to come!

While there are many games that big finance players will play, and some that could put bitcoin at risk, I think the implication that timing is required to come out ahead when buying bitcoin on credit is not entirely fair.

It's not so much about timing the market, as it is is about time in the market. Credit is a viable option still, but carries a risk. If you're not able to maintain the debt independent of bitcoin's fortunes, you're walking into an ambush. However, if for instance you take out $100k at 14% today, and can pay down that debt for 60 months at $2300/mo, and just hodl the bitcoin, then it's not inconceivable that bitcoin will go up more than 14% overall in that time-period, and that you can therefore significantly improve your financial position.

If the choice were between saving $2300/mo in dollars or doing a lump-sum purchase of BTC today and paying down that debt, I think if the interest rate looks good compared to the expected annual return on BTC, then this is still a risky-but-not-insane move.",1,False,,t3_1o0mmqr,0

Thanks for sharing the image. Here are some important observations to help determine if this is legitimate or a scam:

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è Key Red Flags in the Letter

‚úÖ Ledger rarely sends physical letters ‚Äì They officially state that they do NOT send unsolicited postal mail to users.

‚úÖ Mentions a QR code to ‚Äúactivate‚Äù a feature ‚Äì This is a classic phishing method. Scammers often trick users into scanning QR codes to visit fake sites or install malicious apps.

‚úÖ ‚ÄúMandatory by October 10th, 2025‚Äù ‚Äì Unrealistically far-out deadline is unusual and designed to add pressure but avoid immediate suspicion.

‚úÖ Asks you to take action to maintain access ‚Äì Legit Ledger updates usually happen inside the Ledger Live app itself, not via external instructions.

‚úÖ Physical address (Paris) & CEO signature ‚Äì These can easily be copied from public information. Scammers often add them to seem official.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ What a Real Ledger Update Looks Like

Ledger normally communicates updates via:
	‚Ä¢	Official Ledger Live app (desktop/mobile)
	‚Ä¢	ledger.com blog or status page
	‚Ä¢	Verified email from @ledger.com (never asking you to scan QR for setup)
	‚Ä¢	In-device firmware update

They never ask you to:
üö´ Scan a QR code from a letter
üö´ Visit a link outside ledger.com without warning
üö´ Provide any sensitive info via external form

‚∏ª

‚úÖ What YOU Should Do Now

‚úî Do NOT scan the QR code
‚úî Do NOT visit any URL printed in the letter (unless you type it manually and confirm it is EXACTLY ledger.com)
‚úî Go into Ledger Live > Settings > Security and check if ‚ÄúTransaction Check‚Äù exists officially
‚úî Contact Ledger Support directly via ledger.com/support with a photo of the letter

‚∏ª

üß† My Verdict: Highly likely a SCAM / phishing attempt

Physical letters + QR code + urgency is a known phishing tactic targeting hardware wallet users.

‚∏ª

If you want, I can check Ledger‚Äôs official announcements for you or help you verify the URL or the QR code (without you opening it). Just let me know!",1,False,,t3_1o6cnie,0
1o6cnie,cryptocurrency,njs3gyl,MarionberryLucky2143,2025-10-16T12:47:14,"I checked Ledger‚Äôs official sources ‚Äî here‚Äôs what I found:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ What Ledger does say
	‚Ä¢	Ledger has a blog post introducing Transaction Check as a legitimate security feature: it ‚Äúanalyzes Ethereum (EVM) transactions for potential threats before you sign them.‚Äù  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Ledger‚Äôs ‚ÄúTransaction Check‚Äù glossary page states the same feature and explicitly says: ‚ÄúLedger has not made any communications about Transaction Check via mail. Any letters you may have received regarding Transaction Check are scam attempts.‚Äù  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	On their phishing & security status page, Ledger warns that physical mail prompting users to scan a QR code or visit a website is a known phishing scheme: ‚ÄúUsers are receiving physical letters ‚Ä¶ The letters ‚Ä¶ ask you to scan a QR or go to the website ‚Ä¶ Ultimately, users are requested to enter their 24 words.‚Äù  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Ledger‚Äôs phishing page also states: ‚ÄúLedger and Ledger support will never ask for your 24 words ‚Ä¶ Ledger will never contact you via text message or phone call‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf you have doubts about a communication, check Ledger‚Äôs official channels.‚Äù  Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Other security blogs have documented ‚ÄúLedger Physical Letter Scam‚Äù describing very similar letters with QR codes and urging users to enter their seed phrase.  Ôøº

‚∏ª

‚ùó Conclusion (Based on Official Info + Evidence)
	‚Ä¢	Transaction Check is real, as a Ledger feature.
	‚Ä¢	However, Ledger explicitly disavows any postal communications about it. Any physical letter asking you to activate Transaction Check via QR code or a link is a scam (phishing).
	‚Ä¢	The letter you received matches exactly what Ledger warns about as part of a scam campaign.

So, the letter is almost certainly fraudulent / phishing, not something sent by Ledger.

Most of these crypto companies are valued at multiples of their Bitcoin holdings. Worse yet, a lot of them financed their Bitcoin purchases with debt.

This absolutely can lead to a scenario where Bitcoin has to be liquidated to pay their liabilities, while their balance sheet tanks because Bitcoin is basically the only asset on the books, which will lead to investor selloff which will lead to more devaluation which will lead to default which will lead to total liquidation, which will lead to Bitcoin price suppression which will lead to more defaults and it will get nasty.

Is there a scenario where all these companies have time to pay off their debt and can weather a cycle? Yes. Is there a scenario where crypto never hits lows that could trigger the chain reaction? Yes. History to me indicates the most likely scenario is when do have another major crash at some point though. 

But my bets are the next crypto winter will be fueled by a lot of these wallstreet companies failing. Think Mt Gox or FTX or Celsius, but 100 times worse. When will it happen? No clue and I wouldn't be advertising it if I did, I wish I did obviously. But I learned long ago not to try to time these things. I do foresee lots of people will lose a lot of money and blame Bitcoin not the institutions and humans that are using obscene leverage on a volatile asset. Basically, and I'm sure I will be downvoted, but the only thing I disagree with Adam Schiff on is his proclamation that ""its about to hit"". Unless he is part of some cabal that has the ability and motivation to force the first domino to fall, the when is just unknown. The price could hit $500,000 before a crash which would mean unless these wallstreet companies keep issuing new debt and DCA up to similar prices, a 50% crash would not spell doom for them. But now, there is a bubble in the industry. And I have no faith these companies won't continue to be greedy in their leverage. The most recent financials of the Bitcoin based companies paint a clear picture to me, Bitcoin going to $50,000 would be death for most.

The best strategy is and will continue to be stacking sats, self custody, ignore the price swings, and HODL.",29,False,,t3_1o97j29,0

They set up Eth validators that specifically ""lied"" and sent out fraudulent info to trick the bots into misinterpreting the transactions in the mempool they were targeting, to exploit a flaw in the MEV bot code that doesn't check the data of the pending transaction properly. I'm no defender of MEV snipers, but that may be a ""bridge too far"" because fraud is about intent:

Fuck them and I think its great these guys figured out a way to get back at them. 

The article is super vague, but it does say the ""traders"" aka mev bots were left with a lot of worthless memecoins instead of their actual money. 

Mev bots work by finding a transaction about to go through the blockchain that isnt paying top fees fir gas for the transaction, so they can exploit it since its a slower transaction.  They buy a huge amount of the coin right before you buy, and then sell a huge amount right after your transaction goes through. So you are trying to buy in at $1 a coin, but as you put in your transaction the mev bot pumps it to $1.5, so you buy the coin for 1.5, and then they sell a huge amount to drop it back down to 1. So now you have to see a 50% gain just to break even because some mevbot sniped your trade. These guys fucked a mevbot, so Bravo. 

I have some guesses. Ive seen mevbots do trades in the 100s of thousands before to super spike a price. I have no idea how it works but I wonder if there's some set of parameters that makes it choose to go all in like that, and they found that out and then set that situation up, but then had a bot of their own to see when another bot took the bait, let them do the first transaction, and then go crazy max gas fees to alter their coin to turn off selling or give it a 99% sell tax or something. Or just pull the liquidity entirely, so there's just nothing for the mev bot to get back. Or maybe im totally off, but that article is obviously biased and vague, I'd love a better source to know what actually happened.

These guys just straight up hacked the system to get it to do something it wasnt intended to do, by exploiting some bots that werent performing all the security checks they should have to make sure the trades were legitimate trades.

To try and give an example, banks used to do something where they would order transactions in such a way to make you overdraft and charge you fees, for example if you had a balance of 1k, and made a 5k withdrawal and later that day a 5k deposit, they would order the withdrawal first so that you incurred an overcharge fee, then do the deposit.

Now imagine there was an automated system/bot you could run so that you could automatically deposit into your account to avoid overdraft fees when the bank sends you an email that youre overdrawn.

The brothers then did something like spoofing emails to make it look like the emails legitimately came from the bank to get you to deposit into an account, except it was their account the money was deposited into, and they just straight up took it. They also specifically targeted bots that werent implementing security protocols correctly to verify that the transactions were 100% legit before depositing money. Then, afterwards, they took a bunch of elaborate steps to launder the money in the hopes of not getting caught.

Not a perfect analogy, but thats \*along the same lines\* of what they did. And they seem to be pinning their defense on the fact that a) people hate what MEV bots do enough to look the other way that straight up stealing from bots that do shady/unethical stuff is okay, and b) that it will all be so technical that people dont actually understand what happened.

That‚Äôs the same every week so nothing new there. 

Secondly there‚Äôs a huge amount of contagion in leveraged lending markets with at least two US banks facing the reality that their secured loans aren‚Äôt underwritten by unencumbered assets. 

It turns out that the loans they made not only went bad on a biblical scale but the assets they secured those loans against had also been used to secure loans from other banks and lenders. 

Sounds bad but it turns out that there was no due diligence done for those loans done by the lenders in the first place because ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. It also turns out that that entire market tended to do no due diligence on the loans they were making. 

So far so bad, but it gets worse. If a loan was made for $100m it was frequently packaged and leveraged to a $500m loan instrument.

This is the fundamental flaw in the system. The original design involved statesmen - not politicians. You were supposed to serve the country for a term or two and then go home and rejoin the productive citizens with a real job. Re-election matters a great deal less if you're expected to leave office anyway.

Under that model you want to actually solve problems because once you leave office you're going to have to live in the real world under the rules (and solutions) that you built while in service to the people.

But if you never have to actually contribute to (or participate in) society because you spend your entire life as a career politician and thus part of the ""rules for thee and not for me"" crowd you have an active incentive NOT to solve problems in any meaningful way. Problems are what get you re-elected (problems that you create, maintain, and blame on the other side of the same coin.)

Furthermore, you're incentivized not to solve problems that have unpleasant solutions. If the problem is that you're going bankrupt the solution is to cut spending and/or increase revenue. But no one wants to elect the person who cut their favorite social program or who raised taxes. The ""solution"" for a politician is always to kick the can down the road just far enough they can get re-elected and count on the (very reliably) short memory of the public to forget that this person has done that 5 times already come election day.",3,False,,t1_nlxyjcd,2

Meteora, a cryptocurrency protocol, airdropped $4.2 million worth of $MET tokens to three addresses linked to the Trump team just hours after its co-founder, Benjamin Chow, was sued for orchestrating $57 million in pump-and-dump schemes using endorsements from Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei. The airdrop was linked to liquidity provision for the $TRUMP token, and the recipients immediately deposited the tokens into OKX, possibly to cash out. The lawsuit alleges that Chow used celebrity endorsements to manipulate token prices, leading to significant losses for investors. Forensic analysis revealed a central coordinating wallet behind the scheme, which funded deployer wallets and seeded liquidity for multiple tokens, including $MELANIA and $LIBRA, which have since crashed in value.",7,True,,t3_1ofzxfg,0

Try testing gold for its purity. You actually need a facility to heat it up to a certain level and see what happens. Now do this at scale. Not so easy now is it?
        
Now try using gold to transact from one place to another. Oh, you got security costs to send the gold, fees to transport the gold, and you have to have the facility in place to store all the gold. Logistics is a nightmare. It's cumbersome. There is a reason why gold paper certificates were issued. However, they are heavily counterfeited and also the people who accept them have to TRUST the holder and issuer of the gold certificates. There's been quite some issues where the issuer ended up having fake gold in their coffers. How do you protect from an employee coming in and swapping out fake brick with real brick and now you have to audit and test them all over again. It's why we very rarely ever have full on gold reserve audits. Now compare that with bitcoin. It's much more simpler to store bitcoin securely and it also has none of the nasty logistical issues with storing and sending. There are risks associated, but as long as one holds the keys, they are the custodian of their future, and we don't need to trust any institution to act in our interests.

It is true that it is more expensive upfront (around 3x the capital cost per MW), but like I mentioned it pays off from a capacity perspective. 

In the case of Germany the plants were already built, and waste is not that expensive as the waste is small relative to energy output. The technology to recycle waste is on the way. 

I used to be against nuclear. Then I got solar panels and see how inefficient they are. I still like solar for remote locations, but when I looked at the data for all the different types of power nuclear is the most practical, and considered one of the safest with today's technology. 

The reality is with the coming demand of data centers nuclear power is likely going to be the primary option capable of delivering the capacity required. Hydro is competitive for high capacity solutions, so maybe that will pan out as well. Microsoft is already rebuilding the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, Google has small nuclear reactors, and many more nuclear projects already in place and on the way.
