The FBI and SEC has been stripped and replaced with yes men, there is nobody to stop it happening and the culprit is America's president.\n\nI am losing faith.

The ones getting hit the hardest are the small players and retail investors, while the big players, market makers, insiders, and even figures like Trump and his entourage are walking away with massive profits from the chaos.\n\nWhether it’s coordinated dumps, insider moves, or manipulation hidden behind so-called “market corrections,” it’s always the same cycle, retail panic sells while whales quietly accumulate, and the media conveniently explains it away afterward.\n\nOctober 10 was just the latest reminder that the game isn’t fair. The rich get richer, the insiders play with information, and the rest of us are left holding the bag. Maybe it’s finally time for real, global crypto regulation, not to protect the institutions or the elites, but to protect the actual people who believe in this space.\n\nLet’s call Friday, October 10, what it truly was: Crypto Crime Day",

    "selftext": "This cycle feels completely off for anyone who isn’t holding Bitcoin.\n\nI’m not talking about meme coins or the latest #1832 CMC gem promoted by a YouTube gambler. I mean the supposed blue chips. The serious, established projects that actually built, shipped, and survived.\n\n**Here’s where things stand (approx. numbers):**\n\n* **ADA** peaked around **$2.90**, now sits near **$0.85**, about 70% down.\n* **LINK** has improved but is still roughly 50–60% below its ATH. Market CAP close to ATH (sh\\*t tokenomics?)\n* **DOT** peaked near **$55**, now **$4.29**, over 90% drop.\n* **AAVE** has recovered somewhat but still trades at roughly half its ATH.\n* **ALGO** has been bleeding for two years with no clear bottom in sight.\n\nThese are not vaporware projects. They have real ecosystems, partnerships, and communities. Yet the market refuses to reward them. Even after two years of recovery, they are still deep in red territory.\n\n**Now let's look at Ethereum.**\n\nETH should be leading this cycle. Instead, it is just hovering around its previous ATH. At this stage, ETH should be in clear price discovery, not struggling to hold ground.\n\nEvery other week someone posts about “supply shock” and “institutional demand.” Charts showing exchange reserves collapsing from 16 million to 9 million ETH. Every previous time this happened, a massive rally followed.\n\n**This time, nothing.**\n\nSo where is the rally? Where is the institutional bid that was supposed to push ETH into a new era? If this is the cycle top, then something is broken.\n\n**And where is retail?**\n\nYes, we know the global economy is weak. The US economy is shaky, inflation is sticky, interest rates are high, the job market is rolling over, and retail investors have been burned too many times. People are tired. They remember Terra, Celsius, FTX, and every other implosion that wiped out savings. They learned their lesson. They are sitting out, holding cash, or chasing AI stocks instead (the new crypto get rich quick scheme).\n\nBut if the “smart money” and the “supply shock” narratives are both real, why is price action this lifeless?  Where is the demand that’s supposed to absorb the drained supply?\n\n**But that’s not the whole story.**\n\nBecause the truth is, money is flowing. Just not here.\n\nThe S&P 500, Nasdaq, and even gold are at or near all-time highs. Liquidity is alive and well. Capital hasn’t disappeared. It’s simply choosing not to touch altcoins. Institutions are back in equities and Bitcoin. Retail is speculating on Nvidia instead of LINK or DOT. The excuse that “the macro environment is too tough” doesn’t hold when traditional markets are booming and Bitcoin is making new highs. The problem isn’t (only) the economy, it’s demand for alts.\n\n**Old playbook: dead?**\n\nMaybe the uncomfortable reality is that the old playbook no longer works. The traditional rotation pattern of BTC pumping first, ETH following, and alts going parabolic appears to be finished. Capital now stops at Bitcoin and Ethereum. Sometimes it touches Solana and a few new narratives. A big part of liquidity in crypto is also spread thin across thousands of useless projects that still somehow trade daily. That’s it.\n\nIf even Ethereum, with its ETF narrative, deflationary supply, and “institutional adoption” story, cannot decisively break its previous highs, what chance do the others have?\n\nIf ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, and ALGO fail to reach their previous peaks in this environment, they will not recover in the next one. The next bear market will bury them for good.\n\nThis may be the first cycle where altcoin believers realize that not every “strong project” will come back. Bitcoin and a handful of layer-1s will survive. The rest will quietly fade away.\n\nMaybe alt season is not delayed. Maybe it didn’t ever start. Maybe it ended already four years ago?\n\nAnd maybe this cycle is the moment when everyone finally looks around and says, “Is this really it?”\n\nIf ETH and alts don’t pick up by the end of the year, the entire crypto market faces two possible outcomes:\n\n1. **Most Altcoins collapse completely in the next bear market.** Retail won’t come back. Total market liquidity shrinks. The old pattern of alt buyers eventually converting into long-term Bitcoin holders disappears. Even Bitcoin takes a hit, because as much as people like to pretend otherwise, institutions still need retail to dump on.\n2. **Everyone simply buys Bitcoin next time.** Retail and institutions both pile into BTC, ignoring altcoins altogether. One-off alts will still rise, but mostly not. Bitcoin becomes the only real trade left. But this is less likely, since the main appeal of altcoins has always been their higher risk-to-reward upside.\n\nEither way, if nothing changes soon, crypto’s future may be far more narrow than most people think.\n\n**TL;DR** Blue-chip alts like ADA, LINK, DOT, AAVE, ALGO, and even ETH are still far below their 2021 highs. Retail is gone, institutions are all talk, and the classic “BTC -> ETH -> alts” rotation seems dead. If ETH and alts don’t move by year-end, the next bear could wipe out most of the alt market for good, leaving only Bitcoin and a few survivors.",

    "selftext": "Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek has called for a regulatory investigation into exchanges that suffered the largest losses following a record $20 billion in crypto liquidations over the past 24 hours.\n\nIn a Saturday post on X, Marszalek urged regulators to “conduct a thorough review of fairness of practices,” asking whether trading platforms had slowed down, mispriced assets, or failed to maintain proper anti-manipulation and compliance controls during the crash.\n\n“Regulators should look into the exchanges that had most liquidations in the last 24 hours,” he wrote. “Any of them slowing down to a halt, effectively not allowing people to trade? Were all trades priced correctly and in line with indexes?”\n\nData from CoinGlass shows that Hyperliquid led all exchanges in liquidations, recording $10.31 billion in wiped-out positions. It was followed by Bybit with $4.65 billion, and Binance with $2.41 billion. Other major platforms like OKX, HTX and Gate saw smaller totals, at $1.21 billion, $362.5 million and $264.5 million, respectively.",

    "selftext": "Of course it could just be me but there has been a sense of normalization in btc’s rise to six figures even though it’s an all-time high around $122k. I remember the previous runs and the cultural wave they had on retail interest doesn’t seem to exist as much.\n\nHowever, it is not bad necessarily. The retail fomo and SM hype also acted as catalysts in previous runs. But the multiple boom cycles may have created a new boring normal to mainstream adoption. Furthermore, Financial Twitter has shifted focus to AI companies (NVIDIA, OpenAI) and politics from btc as NVIDIA and other techs are riding the AI hype train. Also, psychological aspects such as btc rise from 110k to 122k is less emotionally and attentively impactful as 1k to 20k.\n\nThe institutional money flowing into Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries has fundamentally altered the market dynamics too. Tools like awaken.tax are becoming more relevant as traders move from speculative plays to actual portfolio management. When MicroStrategy or BlackRock buys Bitcoin, it doesn't create the same viral social media moments as retail investors discovering crypto for the first time. These institutional purchases happen quietly, methodically, without the memes and excitement that drove previous cycles. It's efficient but sterile - the kind of adoption we wanted but perhaps didn't expect would feel so... corporate.\n\nAnyone else noticing this shift? Even though it’s still volatile, has btc started to become a maturing asset?",

And remember, if the video starts with “this is not financial advice” they are more than likely getting ready to sell you hopium…. To the moon!!!!!!!!\n",

    "selftext": "Sure \"nobody knows shit about fuck\", and yet people repeat the same mistakes, and the market keeps having familiar things coming back. Not quiet like clockwork, but close enough.\n\nThis is just my personal opinion based on what I learned, so take it with a heap of salt.\n\nIn **bold** is the direct answer.\n\n# Is the bull cycle over?\n\nWith Fed rate cuts just starting? That's highly doubtful.\n\nPlus there's a long list of things going right at the moment.\n\nFor a proper crash and a bubble to burst, you first need a proper bubble.\n\n**We're probably not that far from it, but this market still needs a little more bubble.** Remember, what they say about market irrationality.\n\n# When will the bull cycle end and crash?\n\nFed rates could potentially drag this out longer into early 2026, but don't expect that narrative to stay fresh for too long either.\n\nUltimately, the sooner we get some big rallies, FOMO, and mania (but milder than previous cycles because of tapering volatility), the closer we will be to a crash.\n\nIf this recent rally from $108K to $126K has another leg like that, we won't actually be too far from a proper bubble.\n\nBecause the market loves to create self-fulfilled prophecies, **I would set your clocks for a crash somewhere between mid-November to mid-January**. And clockwork is the one thing that has been somewhat reliable in this market.\n\nEven if everything is rosy at the beginning of 2026, the forces of this market are too strong for a bull market to be extended for too long.\n\n# How high Bitcoin will go?\n\nMake sure you don't look at Bitcoin's history linearly, and start looking at the diminishing returns and tapering down of its volatility. It's a curve.\n\nNow that we're deep in the bull market, the fog is beginning to lift.\n\nFor me the sweet spot of that peak is between **$129K-$149K**. If I had to go with an exact price: $136.9K.\n\nI hope I'm not underestimating FOMO here, and overplaying the \"tapering down\" narrative.\n\n$150K target seems too popular now.\n\n# What about alt season? That's never gonna happen right?\n\nHas no one else seen the glimpses and foreshadowing last November?\n\nIt was very revealing about the nature of the market and how it still behaves with alts. With just enough FOMO in the market, you get people panic buying alts.\n\nThe market has been a little more tamed since, with only one other little injection of FOMO and another alt rally during the summer.\n\nA lower mania phase at the end of Bitcoin's bullrun could spell a milder and shorter alt season.\n\nSo **this alt season could really be milder** with ETH staying under $6K, but other major alts getting maybe only 30%-100% rallies, and a few lucky ones maybe getting 2x-3x. This in a scenario where Bitcoin only hits $136.9K.\n\n**If we get some big BTC mania rally, then yes, there will be some big alt rallies.** Why? Because people are greedy.\n\n# What about the bear winter, is it gonna be as brutal as usual?\n\nBitcoin *should* see its mildest winter. With a maximum drop down by only 60%-70%.\n\nBut what about MSTR, ETFs, big institutions and governments?\n\nIf that stuff implodes, it could create some **shit show** at maybe a higher level than FTX and LUNA.",

    "selftext": "CZ served 4 months in prison last year for violating antimoney laundering laws. got out, then Trump pardoned him. But according to Politico’s reporting and public lobbying filings, that pardon didn’t just happen... binance and CZ spent serious money trying to make it happen.\n\nIn late september, binance hired Ches McDowell ...described in multiple reports as tied to Trump’s circle and close to Donald Trump Jr.... to lobby the White House and treasury. his firm, Checkmate Government Relations, disclosed $450k for roughly one month’s work on “financial services policy and executive relief” targeting the White House Office and Treasury Department. And that’s just one piece of it.\n\nIn March, Zhao also hired Teresa Goody Guillén... a crypto lawyer who had been reported as under consideration for SEC chair.... to lobby the White House for “executive relief.” Reports indicate her firm has received around $290,000 from Binance and Zhao in 2025.\n\noverall, reports put binance’s 2025 lobbying around $860k so far. separately, the trumplinked World Liberty Financial venture launched this year and has clear Trump family connections, though there’s no public filing showing a formal Binance partnership. Coverage describes significant paper gains and fundraising around that venture, with estimates and amounts varying across outlets.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters called the pardon a favor for “crypto criminals,” arguing it came after months of lobbying and money flowing into Trumplinked crypto ventures. Trump defended the move by saying Zhao “was persecuted by the Biden administration” and that what he did “wasn’t a crime.”\n\nBut CZ pleaded guilty to violating U.S. antimoneylaundering laws and accepted a fourmonth sentence. What’s clear is this wasn’t some random act of mercy ..... it followed a concentrated, expensive lobbying push aimed at senior executivebranch offices using Trumpworldconnected lobbyists. They hired heavyweight lobbyists, spent serious money, and operated within Trumplinked crypto circles throughout 2025.\n\nIt’s a pretty stark reminder of how deep regulation and influence now run in crypto. The same compliance systems that failed at the top are the ones regular investors are expected to handle on their own  accurately, every tax season, with no lobbyist to clean up the mess later.\n\nThat’s why a lot of traders I know have started automating the boring side tracking trades using awaken, wallets, and tax exposure in real time  just to stay ahead of the gray areas.

In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.",

    "selftext": "As you can see in the chart above, Ethereum exchange reserves keeps going down in quite fast ways and most people are not paying attention. These reserves are falling again and every time this has happened before its been the calm before a massive rally.\n\nAccording to the Tweet and the chart:\n\n* **2020-2021:** ETH reserves dropped from 16M to 10M while price barely moved. At that time gas fees were sky high , the network was congested and most of the traders were asleep. Then demand suddenly pumped thanks to events like the UNI airdrop and ETH exploded from \\~$400 to nearly $4,800.\n* **2022-2023:** This time another huge outflow happened. This time from 15M to 9M ETH. This happened during the deep in the bear market, FTX was collapsing, banks were failing but supply quietly bled off exchanges. Once macro conditions improved, ETH rocketed from \\~$1,100 to \\~$4,000.\n* **2024-2025 (Now):** We are currently sitting at historic lows (\\~9.2M ETH) while price is around $4000-$4,500. This means ETH is being accumulated and pulled off exchanges, even if price is not exploding yet.\n\nThis is important because supply leaving exchanges is like draining a bathtub while the tap is still running. If buyers keep coming and sellers eventually run dry, the result is explosive and the price surges because there is simply nothing left to sell and buyers still want it.\n\nLower interest rates, expanding liquidity, institutional money flowing back in. history suggests we are on the verge of another violent rally.\n\nIt's time to explore uncharted territory with ETH price.\n\nSource:\n\n* Tweet: [https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482](https://x.com/LeonWaidmann/status/1973678958542819482)",

    "selftext": "everyone freaked out but this is textbook bull market behavior. in every bull run you get 2 to 4 major pullbacks, usually around 30 to 45%. what we saw wasn’t even close to that.\n\nso yeah, it hurts. but it’s not unexpected. it’s not the end of the bull run, it’s part of it.\n\nhere’s what actually happened with the tariff stuff\n\non october 10, trump announced a new 100% tariff on chinese goods. markets freaked out instantly. bitcoin dropped about 8% to roughly $104,782 on oct 10. global stocks and tech megacaps lost over $770 billion in value that day.\nit triggered a broad sell off. traders rushed to de risk, and crypto saw huge liquidations… about $16 to $19 billion wiped out in the episode.\n\nbut this is the usual cycle. markets panic, then the fed steps in. if the sell-off continues, powell could cut rates to stabilize things. rate cuts mean more liquidity. liquidity pushes crypto back up.\nif trade tensions ease or central banks step in with liquidity, markets typically recover. that is the dynamic traders are watching.\n\nthe pullback is kind of an opportunity tbh\n\nwhen people panic sell, that’s usually when you want to buy. panic selling never works long term. if you believed in crypto at $110k, you should love it more at $104k. same asset, cheaper price.\n\ni’ve been holding since 2017. i’ve seen much worse. the people who actually made money weren’t the ones who panic traded… they were the ones who held through the scary dips and kept buying.\n\nhere’s the macro math\nbitcoin still moves with the global money supply. when liquidity expands, bitcoin rises. when it tightens, it drops. right now, governments can’t afford to tighten too hard without breaking something.\nso eventually, more liquidity will come… and that’s when crypto climbs back.\n\n\nthe big picture stays bullish. short term pain, long term trend intact.\n\ndon’t use leverage. seriously. that’s how people get wiped. buy dips only with what you can afford to lose. if you panic sold or got liquidated, those are taxable events. capital losses from the dip can offset your gains from earlier in the year, but only if you report them properly. with all the volatility we've seen, tracking every trade manually is a nightmare. that's where tools like awaken.tax actually help… they pull your transaction history and calculate gains/losses automatically so you're not scrambling in april trying to remember what you sold at $104k versus $110k.\n\nevery dip feels like the end when you’re in it. then six months later, you regret not buying more.",

    "selftext": "After this flash crash we had this past Friday, I've been seeing a ton of stuff about the bull market being over, that there will be no alt season, etc. However, after this flash crash I'm actually more much more bullish now, which I'll elaborate on.\n\nOn Friday we saw the mass liquidation of a bunch of dumbasses leverage trading this market thinking that it was just going to go into a Q4 cycle peak with little to no retracement. During this, we also saw big money players stepping in and loading up on the dip. For instance, Tom Lee's Fundstrat buying up almost 1 BILLION $ in ETH. I'm going to disregard Michael Saylor's recent big purchase of BTC, because he is always buying lol. This event was the equivalent of the COVID crash of 2020 and the FTX liquidation crash of November 2022.\n\nBen Cowen is a very popular youtuber, but I've noticed he is getting a bit weird lately. He kept talking about his ETH target hitting cycle lows, and it \"went home\" to under .02 to BTC back in April. Meanwhile, he continued to bring up the idea that alts needed to go to .25 of the total market before we would see an alt season. However, now that this happened on Friday, he has completely changed his stance, calling for an ETH top of a little over 5k and no alt season lol. Interestingly, on multiple occasions he has brought up how in the 2017 cycle alts hit this .25 target in November of that year and the peak of alt season was January of 2018.\n\nPeople are so god damn bearish and fearful, yet BTC is still trading at around 115k, ETH at over 4k and ADA over 70 cents.\n\nSome other variables to consider. The clarity act is still on the table in congress, and once the government shut down ends it's very likely this will pass within the next few weeks. In addition to this, there are further rate cuts on the table and global liquidity is continuing to rise.\n\nWhat we are seeing is eerily similar to late 2017 and I'm expecting a lot of people to get wrecked. I think what is going to happen is we get a massive rally that seemingly comes out of nowhere. You'll see it talked about all over the news and retail FOMO floods into the crypto space. Things will get beyond euphoric and everyone is going to be convinced it will be a super cycle. I wouldn't be surprised to see BTC at 170k+, ETH at 8k+and some alts doing close to a 10x or more from here. However, the retracement will be just as impressive and happen in a matter of a few weeks.\n\nAs for bear market of 2026. I think we will bottom out around 70-80k, this would be slightly above the highs of 2021, the high of March 2024 and the low of April 2025. We could definitely get into the 60k range, but I think the 50k range is a thing of the past. Target highs of the next cycle around 350-400k.",

However, it’s more likely that Bitcoin's failure to rise with gold means the party is over. Instead of a catch-up boom, expect a belated bust.”\n— Peter Schiff on X\n\nSchiff suggests that instead of Bitcoin benefiting from gold’s momentum, it may face a “belated bust” as investors turn toward traditional safe-haven assets.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been reading a lot of complaints lately about Changelly, and the pattern looks worrying. Many users report that once they try swapping a larger amount, their transaction suddenly goes “on hold” and they’re hit with endless KYC requests, ID, selfies, proof of income, wallet screenshots, and more. Even after submitting everything, several people say their funds were never released.\n\n\n\nSome users claim they tracked their coins on-chain and saw them moved to other exchanges like HitBTC while Changelly insisted the funds were still “under review.” Others noticed the terms of service quietly changing, or the support team asking for new documents each time one set was completed.\n\n\n\nCommon red flags mentioned by users:\n\n\n\n\\- Transactions “on hold” without clear reason or timeline\n\n\\- Constantly changing KYC demands\n\n\\- Lack of transparency about fund status\n\n\\- Funds traced to external exchanges\n\n\\- Support giving vague or repetitive replies\n\n\\- TOS updates after disputes begin\n\n\n\nIt might not be an outright scam, but it definitely feels like a system built to stall or trap users with larger amounts. If you plan to use Changelly, especially for big swaps, read the Reddit threads first, there are a lot of warning stories out there.",

    "selftext": "Hope you survived last friday. Another proof that you shouldn't gamble on perps more then you're willing to loose.   \nAnd its just that - gambling. Not investing. Just placing occasional one direction bets.   \nIt’s been exactly 7 days since the biggest crypto liquidation ever - $19 billion wiped in a few hours. Everyone was overleveraged on HP, Aster, other dexs. I guess if i was the biggest cex by volume, i would also use my own books to price assets instead of relaying on some 3rd party. Loss of speed is main concern, but history gave us different lesson.\n\nNow the question is, was that *the flush* or just the beginning? After all, we're between 2 interest cut rates...\n\nBTC dropped hard but still holding the range. Around 108k down to 106k is where things got ugly. If we drop under 100k, next stops are like 98–94k. I personally don’t see it staying below that long. Weekly close above 100k keeps us safe. Below = probably panic zone.\n\nETH actually looks stronger, still chilling around 3.8k. As long as it closes above that, range intact. Below that, 2.8k is next. SOL also holding like a champ around 84–89, even after four red days.\n\nEveryone’s doomposting right now. Fear and greed Index is deep in *fear*, not extreme fear yet, but close. That’s usually when the best entries happen. I’m not saying ape in, but historically this is where smart money starts scaling in.\n\n[2 clear moments to buy and 2 to sell. Rn we have 3rd mmnt to buy](https://preview.redd.it/bydpm47sayvf1.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb3c6b8694ccfc97b35decde0271a5ccd25dc6d)\n\nAlso worth noting: the global liq index broke its downtrend back in March and is ranging sideways. That’s good. Liquidity drives everything. More liquidity → higher risk appetite → higher BTC\n\n[blue is the global liq index](https://preview.redd.it/wvcz81g4byvf1.png?width=372&format=png&auto=webp&s=bde6cbd30a63695f00c61e4e8242a27122b19f1d)\n\nGold’s at ATH, institutions aren’t selling BTC, and Trump’s probably pushing rate cuts again. Feels like sentiment is way more bearish than fundamentals.\n\nIf BTC does sweep 95–98k, I think it’s a shakeout before another bounce. Not financial advice, just saying… these levels feel like fear is peaking.",

    "selftext": "The Altcoin Season That Wasn't\n\nThe crypto community had a moment of genuine excitement on August 14, 2025, when Coinbase published its bullish assessment, signaling that a \"full-scale alt season\" was on the immediate horizon. \n\nThe Downward Spiral\n\nInstead of soaring, altcoins began a substantial and painful drop almost immediately following, and in the months after, the article's publication. The clearest sign of this sentiment shift can be seen in the Altcoin Season Index, a metric intended to gauge the health and momentum of the altcoin space. From its peak in September, this index has collapsed by approximately 68%.\nThe carnage hasn't been limited to the index, either. Individual tokens across the board have suffered deep corrections, with many popular altcoins seeing their values plunge by anywhere from 50% to a staggering 80% from their local highs. This widespread decline paints a picture of a fearful and risk-averse market.\nCompounding this loss of capital, the Total Market Cap Excluding Bitcoin (Total2)—a key indicator for the collective size of the altcoin market, saw its valuation shrink significantly, falling from around $1.7 trillion down to approximately $1.3 trillion.\n\nTLDR; the altcoin market has gone from anticipating a feast to enduring a famine, with most coins seeing devastating losses since one of the industry's biggest players suggested the good times were about to start.\n\n\n\nThanks Coinbase!

    "selftext": "Long time holder here\n\nNever thought I’d be writing this but here we are.\n\nCardano today is not where I thought it would be when I first bought in January 2021.\n\nAt the time we were sold on the idea that Cardano would “change the world” and that we would “bank the unbanked”\n\nToday we are no closer to that vision in my opinion.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I’ve had some personal success working with projects early on writing content and such. It’s now my full time job.\n\nBut I’ve been immensely disappointed by progress on many fronts including scaling, native USDC, support for content creators like myself, and overall lack of support for builders.\n\nI also thought that governance would be the thing that really brings Cardano forward. But it’s brought a ton of infighting\n\nThe community always seems to be fighting about what proposal gets funded and what doesn’t. And it’s exhausting. And demoralizing \n\nCatalyst, a grant fund, seems as though it’s been somewhat corrupted by people who know how to work the system to get money to fund unprofitable projects\n\nBut that’s a separate issue\n\nI’ve been diversified out of Ada for a while now because of the above reasons and more.\n\nI was a long time, hardcore advocate for Cardano in the early days especially in this subreddit. Now not so much.\n\nIn terms of Defi, the rest of the industry has surged way ahead of Cardano and it’s not even close. \n\nI’ve learned a lot since coming into crypto in 2019. \n\nI think the most important lesson I’ve learned is to just try everything and not lock myself down too hard into one place.\n\nI’m grateful for all the opportunities I’ve been awarded nonetheless and especially grateful for all the friendships I’ve made.\n\nAt this point I can call some of them my fam.\n\nThose are my raw thoughts on Cardano\n\nOpti out \n\nEdit: for what’s its worth, I say this as someone who’s been deeply embedded in the Cardano community for a long time. \n\nWhat I say in this post is the current state of things. Who knows how things change in the future",

Man i really got lucky, like freaking lotto like here. The block is 920440 and it was on my own private public pool running on a umbrel home mini pc. I wont say anything else about miners cause some people say i am trying to advertise, no sir, i just needed to tell someone, anyone. I will owe 158k in taxes.

    "selftext": "I was one of the people who never tried to time the market, was telling others to stay away from leverage, just DCA, yet here I am. Maybe this sad story will contribute to the community.  \n  \nI guess people have different reasons for why they end up using leverage. I don't need to be convinced that Bitcoin is here to stay and it will go up, that's why I was all-in DCAing. Anything left out of my monthly salary would go into Bitcoin. However, in last 1-2 years my monthly expenses rose significantly, and I was upset about not being able to buy as much Bitcoin as I could in the past. This is what led me to the idea that I can make up for that period in 1-2 leverage trades. It all went downhill from there. Last night I lost EVERYTHING - as of today, my total net worth is not far away from the salary I will receive for this month. Everything I got was wiped out, and I'm 36 years old already.\n\nThe realization of my age, how much time it took me to get to the point I was at before touching the leverage, imagining all the things this money could fix today if I just spent it, all those feelings and thoughts, are devastating beyond my ability to describe it. The feeling of shame, the feeling of letting down family and relatives. I won't ever admit to what has happened to anyone, and I will have to live with this feeling of shame likely for ever. I have seen posts suggesting people are suicidal, I am not, but I very well understand why others may be, going through this horror.\n\nWhat's next for me? I'm trying to convince myself that being 36 and having nothing but a car loan and a few furniture pieces is nothing to worry about, I still have a job and hopefully a few years ahead. I will try to build my cash position and just wait for the cycle end and start deploying cash into BTC when price drops below 90-80k again. Maybe in next 6-7-8 years I will get back to the point I was before I got wiped out. And of course I tell myself I will never touch leverage ever again. This is still a nightmare situation, and I'm coping hard, but what else I can do? I feel helpless.\n\nIf you are new to Bitcoin and you think you are late, I was there when price hit $4k low in 2020, and was DCAing before and all throughout - today I'm back to round zero savings at the age of 36, with intention to just get back to buying at whatever prices I will get.\n\nYou can roast me, but this can happen to you, no matter how smart or seasoned you are. One day you may have a random \"valid\" reason to take \"just a little risk\", the next moment you know, you are down to zero. Don't trade, don't use leverage. Behind every lucky shot with gains posted online, there are hundreds if not thousands of lives destroyed. I mean it.\n\nGood luck to everyone.",

    "selftext": "Central Sydney. Martin place. Never seen a queue here before… has fear peaked? Good time to Bitcoin?\n\nMassive lines in Sydney today with people rushing to buy physical gold over the counter, scenes straight out of a financial panic/bubble fears. Or is gold looking attractive to buy right now?\n\nFear and greed index tipped into Extreme Fear today aswell!\n\nAre we seeing peak fear right now? Historically, extreme fear has marked bottoms, not tops. With everyone crowding into safety, could this actually be the perfect moment to buy Bitcoin instead?\n\nCurious what others think is this a buy signal indicating a bottom or just the start of something worse?",

And there was more threads but lots of them got removed by mods and I got \"kicked out\" from some subs as well, that's how much people were against this back then.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of posts lately from people asking about buying Bitcoin on credit. In 2015 when I just turned 18 I bought 85 Bitcoin @ around 235 each with a $20k student line of credit. Instead of going to college I used that money to buy Bitcoin and when i talked about it back then everyone said I was an idiot for doing it. But it worked out great because bitcoin was still a nascent technology at the time. Along with holding my initial position I doubled down many times and greatly grew my stack.\n\nThe problem with buying Bitcoin on credit these days is that the free market alone no longer really determines the price of btc and you are leaving yourself open to being wiped out by a financial entities manipulation. There are lots of government, corporate and central bank games being played with Bitcoin today. In the early bitcoin days things happened organically, it was simple supply and demand that caused the btc price to go up and down. There was also the fact it was a new technology and even if there wasn't demand for btc at some points back then you could still say you believe in the tech and if the tech was solid it would pay off down the line and bitcoin will go mainstream resulting in the btc price exploding.\n\nWell that dream was realized and Bitcoin went mainstream. But the fact that bitcoin is mainstream now also means it has achieved deeper integration with financial institutions and the government. These entities are now manipulating the price of bitcoin like they did with traditional assets. Bitcoin can now have a manufactured downtrend in price caused by these financial institutions. Let's say you buy bitcoin on credit one day, you could be wiped out and lose everything not because of organic sell pressure but because of government/tradfi manipulation pushing the price down. This wasn't a problem back then but it is now. They have enough money to decide when btc pumps and when it dumps because they literally print fiat and unfortunately many in the space today only care about btc going up so they can dump it for fiat. This plays directly into the hands of the financial institutions and central banks. These are the entities that cause recessions, maybe they create another one once you buy on credit and you get wiped out that way. So these days it could be better to buy btc with your own money instead of on credit, so even if there is a downtrend you can still keep your btc and ride it to $1m per coin instead of having to sell it in a downtrend to pay off your credit resulting in you missing gains.\n\nAlso 10 years ago when Bitcoin was $200 each the marketcap was 3 billion, today the Bitcoin marketcap is 2.4 trillion. Almost 1000x bigger. Orders of magnitude of more money needs to be put into bitcoin today to move it the exact same percentage as back then. in 2015 if btc marketcap went up another 3 billion that would double the price. Today for the price to double another 2.4 Trillion needs to be added to the marketcap. Of course literally $2.4 T dollars don't need to be injected but you get what I'm saying, we're on a bigger scale now and it takes much more to move the price. We aren't seeing frequent 40% daily pumps and weekly 10x increase in price anymore for a reason.\n\nFor clarification I still think btc is going to $1m per bitcoin, so of course if you time your credit buys properly you'll come out ahead but do you really think you can time it? The risk of getting caught in a downturn is really big and that could wipe you out.\n\nAnd sorry if this seemed like a doomer post, I don't want this to be taken as a bearish post because I'm still super bullish on Bitcoin and always have been. I just think the central banks are now greatly manipulating bitcoin and wiping people out so they can get even more of peoples bitcoin and control the supply as much as possible. This is all a big plan by them to manipulate Bitcoin like they do everything else, they don't want people owning btc they want it all for themselves. A lot of these ETFs, btc treasuries and other recent tradfi integrations of bitcoin will be used by the government to control the supply of Bitcoin.\n\nAnd even though I say the risk of buying credit on bitcoin is huge today and I wouldn't recommend it some part of me still wants to beat this government and tradfi trash that is trying to corrupt Bitcoin lol. I think I can beat them at their own game so I still have some credit btc positions open. I'm happy I was able to use the tradfi system against them back then and use their credit to purchase real currency btc. That's really the moral in all this, going against fiat and doing your best to make Bitcoin prevail.",

I can pay off my damn house and be free.\n\nI was getting 6G difficulty and i recently got a 212G. I was expecting a 1T at some point but gawd damn i found. 2.08P difficulty valid block. Dont bother dming me as i will just delete it all. I also already “sync” and “validated” my wallet ok.",

I received a lot of advice, and there were five users who helped me with some satoshis. I won’t mention their names, but I’m very grateful to them because, thanks to Bitcoin’s existence, they were able to send money quickly and easily to someone in Africa, in Angola, a place where the minimum wage is less than $70. With their help, I’ll be able to buy a computer, and I’ll only need a good internet connection, which I’ll get very soon. I will use the satoshis in the best way possible to learn more about Bitcoin and spread this technology in my country.\n\nThank you so much to everyone.  \nThe link of my post in coments  \n",

I have no investment knowledge so I spent all this time just reading up on different investing strategies to grow this money long term and hopefully be able to retire early. Finally settled on investing a large proportion in BTC and the remaining in world index fund. Bought 1BTC worth of IBIT ETF, too scared to buy actual BTC because I am a very careless person and will for sure lose the wallet details one day. But I am also scared that maybe the IBIT fund could one day just randomly collapse and all my money is gone. I feel a little uneasy because I suddenly got this huge sum of life changing money and I am scared that I am being too reckless by going so big into BTC. I have read up alot on BTC origin and how the system works so I am praying my investment strategy pays off. But what if we are all wrong and BTC eventually crashes and collapses...\n\nAlso I missed the dip, oh well...",

    "selftext": "I spoke to a man today in his 50s and asked him what he thought about bitcoin. This man is intelligent and very into analyzing stocks and buying re estate. He said bitcoin hold to many risks as it could be regulated and there is no way to know how much bitcoin there will ever be. He talked about how bitcoin can be created just like any other fiat so it’s no different then trading any fiat currency. It’s unbelievable to me how most people don’t understand how awesome this little internet coin really is!",

    "selftext": "A friend bought gold & silver bars ~10 years ago. Now, when prices are high, he went to sell them… and boom — turns out it was a scam.\n\nThe “gold” was actually Nordic gold (copper + zinc + aluminum), and the silver was just copper plated. They only found out when the buyer did an acid test and machine scan. Even the inside of the bar looked real at the time of purchase.\n\nLesson: Even stamped gold isn’t always safe. Scams are real.\n\nWith BTC, the blockchain verifies everything — not some fake 999.99 stamp.\nI’m now shifting from gold/silver to Bitcoin and getting all my metals checked (which also costs extra).\n\nThose who understand this early… win the long game.\nBTC forever 🚀🟠",

The reality is, too many people missed their chance. Instead of admitting it, it’s easier to dismiss Bitcoin as a bubble, a Ponzi scheme, a scam and to call me stupid for buying when the price was a few hundred dollars. Back then, they laughed when I said I bought and told them they should too.\n\nNow, if I don’t sell, I’m an even bigger fool, because in their minds Bitcoin is going straight to zero and I’ll lose everything.\n\nHere’s the thing: calling me an idiot doesn’t bother me. It only makes them feel worse. And if I really am an idiot, then watching me succeed makes it sting even more. Some people just can’t stand seeing those they once thought were dumber than them win. And boy, does it feel good. Keep stacking!!",

To me, this is a big personal accomplishment. I also have this sense of “relief” that I finally achieved this goal. No one can predict what will happen in the future, but I’m highly confident in BTC’s future and that owning BTC is one of the best life choices I’ve made. For me, it’s partly about building generational wealth. Whatever short-term market volatility is just noise. I’m looking at the big picture. My BTC is secured with a cold wallet with my seed phrase etched in steel plate and stored in a vault. Now to slowly work on accumulating a second coin…\n\nAnyway, if you’re reading this post, thank you for reading. No one, except for my wife, is aware of my BTC (and I’ll keep it that way). So, I just wanted to share this happy personal moment at least anonymously. Cheers!",

    "selftext": "Bitcoin was the **6th** attempt at digital money. The thing Bitcoin was the first for, is solving the Byzantine General problem. \n\nFor those who don't know what this is; it's a balance of features within the protocol that makes Bitcoin impossible to control from a central authority. It makes it so Bitcoin is maintained and operated by ALL participants and no one has any more power than anyone else. No governments, no corporations, no institutions... no one. \n\nThere have been over **20,000,000** attempts to improve on how Bitcoin solves the Byzantine General problem and all have failed to even come close to Bitcoin's effectiveness and security in doing so. \n\nSo no, Bitcoin was not the first. It was the best, still is the best, and with the Network Effects and Lindy Effects already in place will remain the best protocol for creating a neutral, incorruptible and immutable monetary network for hundreds of years. That is not an exaggeration.  \n\nThe next time someone says \"first mover advantage\", give them a history lesson.\n\nThere is no second best, and there never will be. ",

    "selftext": "I’ve been thinking a lot about Bitcoin’s price action this year, and something just feels *off*. It’s been unusually quiet.. almost *suppressed?* Historically, we’d be deep into the parabolic phase of the 4-year cycle by now, but instead, Bitcoin seems to be held back.\n\nHere’s my theory:  \nWe might be witnessing deliberate suppression by powerful players, the kind of “elites” who understand Bitcoin’s long-term potential and want to ensure that *most people never get to own much of it*.\n\nThink about it, it’s now Q4 2025, and everyone’s expecting a market top soon. Many holders are probably planning to sell, expecting a brutal bear market in 2026 (just like in past cycles). Meanwhile, the Fed is pivoting, lowering rates and ending QT.\n\nSo what happens?  \nIf Bitcoin doesn’t go parabolic by the end of this year, a lot of people will lose faith. They’ll sell, sit on the sidelines, and wait for a “classic” 50–60% drop next year to buy back in cheaper.\n\nBut what if that drop *never comes*?\n\nWhat if, instead, early 2026 is when Bitcoin *finally* takes off, breaking far above $200k when most retail investors are out of the market, expecting a bear? By then, the big players (who’ve been quietly accumulating) will already hold massive positions. They won’t let Bitcoin dump again because they know it’s the future of money and they’ll want to control the scarce supply before it becomes completely out of reach for regular people.\n\nSo maybe 2025’s “boring” price action is the setup. The real move might start when everyone’s least expecting it, right after most people sell.\n\n  \nPS: in case you wanna comment on AI, yes, this post has been written with the help of AI just to make it easier to read and fix grammar mistakes, but the idea comes from my own thoughts and AI summed it pretty well. Thank you for understanding. So ye, let me know what what you think, could this be a real possibility? xd",

Governments and institutions that once called it “dangerous” are now quietly investing in it. Meanwhile, huge mining operations in certain countries control a massive share of the hash rate, and ETF approvals seem to come right when retail hype spikes.\n\nIt’s almost as if Bitcoin, which started as a symbol of financial freedom, is slowly being pulled into the same centralized power structures it was meant to escape.\n\nWhat if that’s been the plan all along?\nWhat if “decentralization” is just the illusion keeping everyone hooked while institutions quietly consolidate control behind the scenes?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts — am I overthinking, or is there a deeper game being played here?",

    "selftext": "Bitcoin just reached a new all-time high at $125,296, climbing roughly 1.8% in the past day and about 13% over the week, yet the market feels unusually calm. There’s no noise or sudden rush of retail excitement, no flood of speculative chatter that usually surrounds a move like this. Instead, the mood feels almost reflective, as if the market itself understands that this run is being built differently. Most of the strength appears to be coming from deep spot demand as institutions quietly accumulate through ETFs, banks raise their forecasts with growing confidence, and corporate treasuries continue to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Exchange reserves have dropped to their lowest level in seven years, meaning there’s less liquidity available to absorb new demand, so even modest inflows are having an amplified effect on price.  \n  \nFrom a technical perspective, the setup still leans cleanly bullish. Momentum remains firm without being overheated, the RSI sits comfortably below the overbought zone, and the breakout above the $123K range has held without much resistance. Historically, October has been one of Bitcoin’s stronger months, and that seasonal rhythm seems to be unfolding once again. Yet what makes this moment stand out isn’t just the numbers or the structure, it’s the silence surrounding it. This feels like an all-time high built on steady conviction rather than emotion, where accumulation outweighs speculation and confidence replaces hype. If the earlier cycles were driven by noise and euphoria, this one seems to be defined by patience and quiet strength.",

    "selftext": "I spent a year at Polygon dealing with the same frustrating problem: new engineers took 3+ months to become productive because critical knowledge was scattered everywhere. A bug fix from 2 years ago lived in a random Slack thread. Architectural decisions existed only in someone's head. We were bleeding time.\n\nSo I built ByteBell to fix this for good.\n\n# What it does:\n\nByteBell implements a state-of-the-art knowledge orchestration architecture that ingests every Ethereum repository, EIP, research papers, technical blog post, and documentation. Our system transforms these into a comprehensive knowledge graph with bidirectional semantic relationships between implementations, specifications, and discussions. When you ask a question, ByteBell delivers precise answers with exact file paths, line numbers, commit hashes, and EIP references—all validated through a sophisticated verification pipeline that ensures <2% hallucinations.\n\n# Under the hood:\n\nUnlike conventional ChatGPT wrappers, ByteBell employs a proprietary multi-agent architecture inspired by recent advances in Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG). Our system features:\n\n1. **Dynamic Knowledge Subgraph Generation**: When you ask a question, specialized indexer agents identify relevant knowledge nodes across the entire Ethereum ecosystem, constructing a query-specific semantic network rather than simple keyword matching.\n2. **Multi-stage Verification Pipeline**: Dedicated verification agents cross-validate every statement against multiple authoritative sources, confirming that each response element appears in multiple locations for triangulation before being accepted.\n3. **Context Graph Pruning**: We've developed custom algorithms that recognize and eliminate contextually irrelevant information to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio, preventing the knowledge dilution problems plaguing traditional RAG systems.\n4. **Temporal Code Understanding**: ByteBell tracks changes across all Ethereum implementations through time, understanding how functions have evolved across hard forks and protocol upgrades—differentiating between legacy, current, and testnet implementations.\n\n# Example:\n\nAsk \"How does EIP-4844 blob verification work?\" and you get the exact implementation in all execution clients, links to the specification, core dev discussions that influenced design decisions, and code examples from projects using blobs—all with precise line-by-line citations and references.\n\n# Try it yourself:\n\n[ethereum.bytebell.ai](http://ethereum.bytebell.ai)\n\nI deployed it for free for the Ethereum ecosystem because honestly, we all waste too much time hunting through GitHub repos and outdated Stack Overflow threads. The ZK ecosystem already has one at [zcash.bytebell.ai](http://zcash.bytebell.ai), where developers report saving 5+ hours per week.\n\n# Technical differentiation:\n\nThis isn't a simple AI chatbot—it's a specialized architecture designed specifically for technical knowledge domains. Every answer is backed by real sources with commit-level precision. ByteBell understands version differences, tracks changes across hard forks, and knows which EIPs are active on mainnet versus testnets.\n\n# Works everywhere:\n\nWeb interface, Chrome extension, website widget, and integrates directly into Cursor and Claude Desktop \\[MCP\\] for seamless development workflows.\n\n# The cutting edge:\n\nThe other ecosystems are moving fast on developer experience. Polkadot just funded this through a Web3 Foundation grant. Base and Optimism teams are exploring implementation. Ethereum should have the best developer tooling, Please reach out to use if you are in Ethrem foundation. DMs are open or reach to on twitter [https://x.com/deus\\_machinea](https://x.com/deus_machinea)\n\n# Anti-hallucination technology:\n\nWe've achieved <2% hallucination rates (compared to 45%+ in general LLMs) through our multi-agent verification architecture. Each response must pass through multiple parallel validation pipelines:\n\n1. **Source Retrieval**: Specialized agents extract relevant code snippets and documentation\n2. **Metadata Extraction**: Dedicated agents analyze metadata for versioning and compatibility\n3. **Context Window Management**: Agents continuously prune retrieved information to prevent context rot\n4. **Source Verification**: Validation agents confirm that each cited source actually exists and contains the referenced information\n5. **Consistency Check**: Cross-referencing agents ensure all sources align before generating a response\n\nThis approach costs significantly more than standard LLM implementations, but delivers unmatched accuracy in technical domains. While big companies focus on growth and \"good enough\" results, we've optimized for precision first, building a system developers can actually trust for mission-critical work.\n\nAnyway, go try it. Break it if you can. Tell me what's missing. This is for the community, so feedback actually matters. [ethereum.bytebell.ai](http://ethereum.bytebell.ai)\n\nPlease try it. The models have actually become really good at following prompts as compared to one year back when we were working on Local AI [https://github.com/ByteBell](https://github.com/ByteBell). We made all that code open sourced and written in Rust as well as Python but had to abandon it because access to Apple M machines with more than 16 GB of RAM was rare and smaller models under 32B are not so good at generating answers and their quantized versions are even less accurate.\n\nEverybody is writing code using Cursor, Windsurf, and OpenAI. You can't stop them. Humans are bound to use the shortest possible path to money; it's human nature.  \nImagine these developers now have to understand how blockchain works, how cryptography works, how Solidity works, how EVM works, how transactions work, how gas prices work, how zk works, read about 500+ blogs and 80+ blogs by Vitalik, how Rust or Go works to edit code of EVM, and how different standards work.  \nWe have just automated all this. We are adding the functionality to generate tutorials on the fly.\n\nWe are also working on generating the full detailed map of GitHub repositories. This will make a huge difference.\n\n**If someonw has told you that \"Multi agents framework with Customised Prompts and SLMs/LLMs\" will not work, Please read these papers.**\n\n**Early MAS research**: Multi-agent systems emerged as a distinct field of AI research in the 1980s and 1990s, with works like Gerhard Weiss's 1999 book, Multiagent Systems, A Modern Approach to Distributed Artificial Intelligence. This research established that complex problems could be solved by multiple, interacting agents.   \n**The Condorcet Jury Theorem**: This classic theoretical result in social choice theory demonstrates that if each participant has a better-than-random chance of being correct, a majority vote among them will result in near-perfect accuracy as the number of participants grows. It provides a mathematical basis for why aggregating multiple agents' answers can improve the overall result.   \n  \n**An Age old method to get the best results, If you go to Kaggle majority of them use Ensemble method. Ensemble learning:** In machine learning, ensemble methods have long used the principle of aggregating the predictions of multiple models to achieve a more accurate final prediction. A 2025 Medium article by Hardik Rathod describes \"demonstration ensembling,\" where multiple few-shot prompts with different examples are used to aggregate responses.\n\n**The Autogen paper:** The open-source framework AutoGen, developed by Microsoft, has been used in many papers and demonstrations of multi-agent collaboration. The paper AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation Framework (2023) is a core text describing the architecture. \n\n**Improving LLM Reasoning with Multi-Agent Tree-of-Thought and Thought Validation (2024)**: This paper proposes a multi-agent reasoning framework that integrates the Tree-of-Thought (ToT) strategy. It uses multiple \"Reasoner\" agents that explore different reasoning paths in parallel. A separate \"Thought Validator\" agent then validates these paths, and a consensus-based voting mechanism is used to determine the final answer, leading to increased reliability.   \n  \n**Anthropic's multi-agent research system:** In a 2025 engineering blog post, Anthropic detailed its internal multi-agent research system. The system uses a \"LeadResearcher\" agent to create specialized sub-agents for different aspects of a query, which then work in parallel to gather information.   \n",

We’ve just gone live with an integration that I think meaningfully improves the onboarding experience for Ethereum users.\n\nWe integrated Coinbase Ramp directly into Pistachio to make getting funds onto Base simple and fast.\n\nHere’s what it looks like today:\n\n* Instant deposits of USDC and ETH directly to Base (up to $500/week)\n* Apple Pay support (debit cards only for now)\n* No ID checks required for US residents (including NY!)\n* No fees for the first $50,000 deposited  \n* All settling natively on Base without extra hops or bridge delays  \n\nWhy this matters:\n\n* Coinbase Ramp provides a secure and compliant fiat-to-crypto flow, but funds arrive in a **self-custody smart wallet**, not a custodial account  \n* Deposits go straight to Base, avoiding mainnet friction and unnecessary costs for new users\n* Waiving early fees allows people to test the flow without losing value on the way in  \n\nOnboarding remains one of the hardest problems in crypto. Our goal is to remove barriers for new users while keeping the experience fully onchain and user-owned.\n\nThe integration is live today. I would love feedback from this community, whether it’s testing the flow or critiquing the approach (L2, L2, I know). We are building for scale, but also want to make sure we get it right for early adopters.\n\nCheck us out here![ https://pistachio.fi/](https://pistachio.fi/download)\n\nFull announcement: [https://x.com/PistachioFi/status/1975939301780369797](https://x.com/PistachioFi/status/1975939301780369797)\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper on the tech stack if people are interested.\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nBrian",

    "selftext": "Now that Bhutan has put their national ID system on Ethereum, I thought I'd raise the topic of \"one person, one unit of stake\" (term from Bryan Ford) and how every country in the world could be running their own national blockchain within a few years or a decade. This is a topic that is not given much focus by leaders in \"blockchain\", although Gavin Wood has increasingly talked about it in the last couple of years and made it a priority to migrate Polkadot to \"one person, one unit of stake\", what I call \"proof-of-suffrage\". To me, it is inevitable, and a logical next step, that every country in the world starts to run such a system. For traditional national IDs to be secure on-chain, the newer generation \"digital ID\" is needed where the personal data is held by the individual and proofs are generated with \"trapdoors\" and such (so they cannot be leaked) and possibly things like \"zero knowledge proofs\" to prove \"is over 18\" (I do not understand how those works but it seems like it could apply there). Such are starting to make their way into national ID systems and Bhutan is (I assume) using that technology. This all seems like something that people all over the world could unite around, both people in a presumed \"crypto community\" and then also all other people who are part of the \"nation state community\" or \"international community\". A very good thing is that once a very good standard for \"proof-of-suffrage blockchain\" has been produced, every country can use that (incl. Bhutan...) but it can also be used with alternative national ID systems such as video pseudonym parties from 2015/2018.",

AMA!**\n\n[Trailer for Code is Law](https://reddit.com/link/1o8a3i9/video/jfhgvq04xhvf1/player)\n\nHey everyone - I’m James, a UK-based investigative journalist and first-time indie filmmaker. I’ve spent the past two years alongside my fellow director Louis Giles making *Code is Law*, a feature-length documentary about some of the most infamous exploits in Ethereum’s history.\n\nThe film explores a wave of massive smart contract hacks where attackers stole millions — and then claimed it was all perfectly legal. Starting with **The DAO**, it traces a lineage of exploits including **Indexed Finance**, **KyberSwap**, and **Mango Markets**, where the phrase “*code is law*” went from meme to courtroom defence. \n\nWe speak to the developers, investigators, and white hats who lived through these events - including the hunt for **Andean Medjedovic**, a teenage math prodigy who stole **$65 million** and became the first hacker to claim “code is law”. Medjedovic is now a **fugitive from FBI charges** who has been on the run for almost five years. \n\nThe film also covers the case of Avraham Eisenberg, whose $110 million Mango Markets exploit became the first courtroom test of the 'code is law' defence - and set a legal precedent with global implications.\n\n**TRAILER:**[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIDjfymuTIw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIDjfymuTIw)\n\n**Streaming from Oct 21 on Apple TV, Amazon Prime & Vimeo**  \nMore info / clips / updates:[ https://x.com/CodeIsLawFilm](https://x.com/CodeIsLawFilm)\n\nFull release info:[ Journeyman.tv](https://www.journeyman.tv/film/8785)\n\n**Featured cast (alongside X usernames):**\n\n**The DAO**  \n• Griff Green - Community Manager (@thegrifft)  \n• Christoph Jentzsch - Creator (@ChrJentzsch)  \n• Simon Jentzsch - Co-creator (@simon\\_jentzsch)  \n• Lefteris Karapetsas - Developer (@lefterisJP)  \n• Fabian Vogelsteller - Curator (@feindura)\n\n**Indexed Finance**  \n• Laurence Day - Technical contributor @functi0nZer0)  \n• Dillon Kellar - Founder (@d1ll0nk)\n\n**White Hat Group & Investigators**  \n• Ogle (@cryptogle)\n\n**Security Researchers**  \n• Daniel Luca (@cleanunicorn)  \n• Goncalo Sá (@feindura)\n\n**Academics**  \n• Paul Dylan-Ennis (@post\\_polar\\_)\n\n**Ask me anything about the film, the real cases it covers, or the legal/ethical minefield of 'code is law.' Happy to talk about how we tracked down and interviewed key figures from Ethereum's early days, white hats, and victims of nine-figure exploits - and what it took to get them on camera.**",

    "selftext": "As someone who’s spent years deep in DeFi and cross-chain routing, I’m genuinely excited to see how far Ethereum’s privacy stack has come. Between the Ethereum Foundation’s new privacy cluster, tools like Kohaku, Privacy Pools, Aztec, and Nightfall, it finally feels like the ecosystem has accepted that privacy has come to stay. \n\nBut let’s be honest: as good as these developments are, they only solve part of the equation. Too many people still think that zero-knowledge rollups, mixers, or private L2s are enough, but they aren’t imo. The new benchmark for privacy does not lie on just making transactions private inside one network, it lies on keeping them private across every route.\n\nEvery time you move assets from Ethereum to another chain, you expose the pattern. Bridges and DEX aggregators still broadcast wallet routes, swap sizes, and intent. Chain analytics just needs consistency. If a wallet’s moves are visible across multiple networks, privacy breaks down long before compliance ever enters the picture.\n\nThat’s why I think the next phase for Ethereum privacy won’t be another L2 or ZK primitive, it’ll be a cross-chain privacy infrastructure. This is where I see Houdiniswap coming in. \n\nProjects like Houdiniswap are starting to define this new layer. It’s not a mixer, and it’s not an L2. It’s a privacy focused cross-chain DEX aggregator, supporting 4000+ tokens across 100+ blockchains, designed around one principle: compliant privacy at the routing layer.\n\nEach swap uses a single-use wallet to prevent address linkage, and the protocol’s dual exchange system randomizes base layer paths so even the route itself doesn’t form an easily traceable pattern. The architecture separates routing logic from custody, meaning no shared pools, no bridge custody, and no mixer risk.\n\n\n\nWhen you put that next to the current landscape, you can see the difference clearly:\n\n* Aztec and Nightfall are strong inside Ethereum but stay single domain.\n* Railgun delivers on-chain privacy within EVMs but not cross ecosystem.\n* 1inch and Rubic excel at aggregation, but expose every hop to explorers and bots.\n* Houdiniswap merges both worlds: privacy, liquidity, and compliance in one routing layer.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nEthereum’s privacy roadmap from PSE’s primitives to Kohaku’s wallet SDK is setting a new standard for how assets move within the network. But the moment those assets cross chains, all that protection disappears unless the routing layer itself is private and compliant.\n\nCross-chain privacy remains one of the most underserved opportunities in DeFi, and Houdiniswap’s compliant routing system is built specifically to close that gap.\n\nThis gives both professional traders and institutions a way to execute across ecosystems without turning their wallets into public datasets. For retail users, it keeps DeFi usable without giving up control.\n\nWe’re watching privacy evolve from “mixing” to provable, compliant confidentiality and the protocols that can deliver it across chains will define the next stage of DeFi.\n\nBetween Aztec, Nightfall, Railgun, and now Houdiniswap, the privacy space on and around Ethereum is heating up fast.\n\nI’m genuinely excited to see which approach leads because whichever one does will set the standard for the next decade of private, compliant, and truly cross-chain finance.",

    "selftext": "Stobox recently launched a regulated security token offering (STO) for Monerys AG — and it’s powered by the **EIP-2535 Diamond Standard**.\n\nAccording to their announcement, the Stobox 4 tokenization platform’s **STV3 Protocol Architecture** is built on Diamonds, giving it modular and upgradeable smart contracts. This allows the security token’s logic (compliance rules, jurisdictional requirements, governance modules, etc.) to evolve without redeploying the token contract.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n* **Regulatory flexibility** – facets can be upgraded to meet changing legal requirements.\n* **Stability** – the token address stays the same, aiding audits and investor trust.\n* **Reusability** – the platform can support multiple offerings using shared contract modules.\n\nThis is one of the first public examples of **Diamonds used in a regulated STO**, showcasing how EIP-2535 can support real-world asset tokenization and long-term contract maintenance.\n\nFull article: [https://blog.stobox.io/monerys-ag-launches-first-security-token-offering-on-stobox-4/](https://blog.stobox.io/monerys-ag-launches-first-security-token-offering-on-stobox-4/)",

The catch:\n\n* Our audience are **privacy-first Web3 users**, so we **don’t want to collect emails** or any personal info.\n* We also **can’t really use Stripe**, since that involves traditional KYC and fiat rails.\n* Each user might **connect multiple wallets** under the same subscription tier.\n\nI’m trying to figure out the cleanest way to implement this kind of setup.\n\nSome early thoughts:\n\n* Using **smart contracts** for subscription tiers (maybe via ERC-721 or ERC-1155 “membership NFTs”).\n* Payment in **stablecoins** (USDC, DAI, etc.) or native gas tokens (ETH, MATIC, etc.).\n* Maybe integrate something like **Superfluid** for streaming payments, or **Unlock Protocol** for token-gated access.\n* Managing multiple wallets per user without a centralized identity layer is tricky — possibly link wallets via signed messages or ENS text records?\n\nHas anyone tackled a **non-custodial, privacy-respecting subscription** model before?  \nWhat tools or protocols would you recommend as “Web3-native Stripe alternatives”?\n\nWould love to hear how others are approaching subscription logic, recurring payments, and wallet linking in decentralized contexts.",

    "selftext": "When the user signs something with their national ID, does the party they verify against receive the full ID signed by the government (such that it can be leaked), and does these credentials (that conform to \"W3C standard\" right) include a \"decentralized identifier\", and on Ethereum there is a lookup table somewhere with Bhutan \"decentralized identifiers\" to public keys, such that the party being verified against can verify that the person was the owner of the credentials?\n\nIn other words, can the credentials trivially be leaked, as there is no \"trapdoor\" or such (as this requires the government key being the one that authenticates, and if user authenticates that part has to be sacrificed but the benefit is the government is no longer notified each time ID is used)?\n\n**Edit:** According to Claude AI it seems BBS+ is what solves this problem, and lets the signed credentials still be proven only relative the party verified against, such that they cannot leak the credentials. **Edit:** It now seems the Bhutan ID does not have that property, and that it would require \"designated verifier signatures\". Anyone who is an expert on how Bhutan national ID works or the standard it is based on (W3C?) feel free to explain.\n\n**Update:** It seems the Bhutan national ID is not private as proofs can be leaked (and in cybersecurity they should be considered public, anything that can leak will leak). Whereas designated verified signatures, an older and probably simpler system, seems to provide true privacy. I assumed \"state of the art\" national ID on Ethereum would do so, but seems it does not. I am *not an expert* on these things, and I am trying to understand best I can as I am interested in seeing advances in digital ID.\n\nSteinfeld, R., Bull, L., Wang, H., Pieprzyk, J. (2003).

    "selftext": "All decentralized multihop payments like Raiden/Lightning (and also Ryan Fugger's base layer) have historically used a 2-phase commit that defaults to cancel the payment to manage the attack vector of money reserved for payment being stuck for all eternity. This solution brings with it the risk of a penalty (note, only on *one* of the phases) that may end up imposed on an innocent intermediary. The original solution to this in 2006 was to make the penalty gradual, a microscopic amount per second, but the problem is that the cumulative time until the payment times out then tends to get so long that the timeout itself no longer serves to solve the \"reserve payment attack\", and while the penalty could be a sufficient solution *there was only a penalty on one of the phases*. So, people settled for \"staggered timeouts\" as a work around, but this does not fix the problem, network failures or denial of service attacks can still cause an innocent intermediary to end up paying for the full payment.\n\nThe solution is to add the penalty on both phases. This is easily done once you realize that the *other* 2-phase commit, that finishes on timeout, also only has a penalty on one of the phases but it has it on the *opposite* phase. Thus, you can simply **combine** them and add a phase in between that shifts the action of the timeout, thus you get a 3-phase commit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/acpqejl9r3tf1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4714eaa27a4ad245d2ab352a11b3bc69fa9b339\n\nI built Ryan Fugger's base layer already (just 2500 lines of code with zero dependencies) and adding \"collateral\" (\"state proof\" on top of the \"base payment channel\") is very easy. Raiden could be built and finished with minimal work. If anyone is interested. My goal is already achieved with the base layer (as my vision only required it to exits) but I could help out with pointers if anyone wants to get a real Raiden created.\n\nI have more material, video presentation, complete implementation, etc, if anyone is interested. And I can walk anyone through it as well in chat for example here in discussion thread, the 3-phase commit is **very simple** it was just a bit hard to discover as people tend to follow the path already made by others (the cancel-on-timeout 2-phase commit, whereas I approached the other one and naturally noticed both together would *transcend* the limitations of either).\n\nHakuna matata,  \nJohan",

It’s where open-source builders, researchers, educators, and creators can receive community funding through mechanisms like quadratic funding — where 100 people donating $1 matters more than 1 person donating $100.\n\nWhat makes this round special is that the Privacy Round is using MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) and Privote, a private, zk-proof-based voting system that ensures every vote is tamper-proof, private, and verifiable — making this round a real experiment in testing zk-based voting that could one day power even bigger digital democracies. \n\nMy channel focuses on values-driven, principles-led crypto education — shining light on projects building real-world utility and privacy tech (think Railgun, Fileverse, Fluidkey, etc).\n\nIf that resonates, you can support my work through Gitcoin here: [https://gitcoin.privote.live/rounds/0/0xcf7e8154450b0b6c477d9984ec3dec12bc4ea602c0913accc08e26a9a705bce1](https://gitcoin.privote.live/rounds/0/0xcf7e8154450b0b6c477d9984ec3dec12bc4ea602c0913accc08e26a9a705bce1)\n\nEvery donation, even $1, helps massively thanks to quadratic funding — and all proceeds go directly to keeping the channel going and spreading the good word on good work in crypto.\n\nI also made a video breaking all this down — from Gitcoin’s funding model to how MACI works:\n\n🎥 [https://youtu.be/P29VM2FIvNY?si=kj5A4gyidQSwPNCM](https://youtu.be/P29VM2FIvNY?si=kj5A4gyidQSwPNCM)\n\nWould love any thoughts or feedback from the community — especially from those experimenting with zk tech, onchain governance, or past Gitcoin rounds.\n\nThank you 🥰",

Do you intend to refuse me access to my funds?  Do you really want to get sued?.  Don't make the mistake of ignoring this.  I expect to be able to access my funds without agreeing to arbitrary terms of conditions that you dictate.  My acceptance of your previous terms and conditions does not allow you to force me to agree to all future terms of conditions while holding my funds hostage. \n\nIf the new company running Safe{Wallet} is on this sub, you guys need to respond to this and explain what you're playing at.

I accessed it today for the first time since I created it and with my ethereum there is something called Livepeer (LPT). I looked it up and whatever, I don't care about it. Why I have it and how it got there is beyond me. It's worth about $12. I moved my ethereum to a hardware wallet and now want to swap the LPT to ethereum and get it out of the myetherwallet account. I can't seem to do anything with it. I looked it up and it seems without any ETH for gas I can't do anything about it. I moved $2 worth of ETH back into the wallet and it still states that I don't have enough for gas.  Before I just abandon the free $12 how does one determine how much gas is needed? I looked it up at current rates and it seems I should only need like $0.12 but $2.00 in ETH isn't doing it. Any ideas out there before I just let it go?  Thank you.",

    "selftext": "A small coup once took place in Ethereum’s early days...not a fork or governance vote, but a literal on-chain takeover between some of its founders. Back in 2016, Alex Van de Sande (Avsa) launched a joke token called Unicorn Meat, poking fun at Ethereum’s unicorn mascot by tokenizing “grinded unicorns.” It started as an April Fool’s experiment, but like many things in early Ethereum, it accidentally became something more, one of the first DAO-style experiments and possibly the first trustless token swap ever.\n\nMembers of the “Unicorn Meat Association” could make proposals, vote, and even seize control of the contract. That’s exactly what happened when Piper Merriam, another core Ethereum dev, staged an on-chain coup and took ownership from Avsa. Vitalik even interacted with the reddit posg himself. It was playful, chaotic, and years ahead of its time... a few months later, the real DAO hack would happen, but Unicorn Meat had already lived the prototype version of that story.\n\nNow, almost a decade later, the contract has been revived in the same spirit, through another coup. Unicorn Meat is back and tradable again. It’s the only memecoin ever created by Ethereum Foundation devs, and a genuine piece of on-chain history.\n\nIf you appreciate old contracts, early Ethereum culture, or just good blockchain stories, this one’s worth biting into.

    "selftext": ">**TL;DR:** Solana should realistically be worth between 1,000 and 3,000 per coin based on adoption, usage, and network economics. As of writing this, it trades under 200 and will likely fall lower during the coming market retrace. That will not be a crash. It will be the best asymmetric opportunity in crypto in the next 2 to 3 years. If you do not understand why yet, this post explains the fundamentals behind that valuation and why the current market still severely misprices Solana.\n\nSolana should already be worth 1,000 based on utility alone. That will sound dramatic to people who think in headlines rather than data, but the reality is simple. Price does not move first. Usage moves first. Price catches up. The Solana network has already entered the phase where reality is far ahead of its valuation. The repricing has not started yet.\n\nThis is not a meme or a hype cycle pitch. Solana sits at the intersection of three truths. It has real users. It has real throughput. It has real developer activity. Crypto is finally maturing into an industry where capital follows usage. Usage follows scalability. Scalability drives liquidity. Liquidity drives market caps. Solana is ahead of everyone except Bitcoin and Ethereum, yet it is still priced like a high beta speculation token rather than what it actually is, which is a core piece of blockchain infrastructure.\n\n# What Solana actually is\n\nSolana is often mischaracterized as a faster version of Ethereum. That is incorrect and outdated thinking. Solana is a monolithic high performance execution layer. Ethereum is evolving into a modular settlement system that relies on external rollups and bridges. These differences are not cosmetic. They produce entirely different network behaviors and application capabilities.\n\nEthereum will remain the preferred environment for high value settlement and institutional DeFi. Solana is built for scalable real time transactions and consumer level blockchain applications. It is the first chain to function like an actual financial engine rather than a slow L1 base layer. This is why activity on Solana looks nothing like a typical altcoin. The network actually runs.\n\n# Usage explains the mispricing\n\nNetworks with real activity eventually dominate market cap rankings, but it does not happen instantly. For months, even years, there is a lag where usage metrics separate sharply from price. That is where Solana is now.\n\nSome relevant facts:\n\n* Solana is consistently one of the top blockchains in daily active users and frequently ranks #1 by real users when filtering out spam activity.\n* Transaction throughput and volume are sustained by real usage, including DeFi, trading, payments, and consumer apps.\n* Solana has one of the fastest growing developer ecosystems in crypto.\n* On-chain DEX volume regularly competes with and sometimes *exceeds* Ethereum, especially during high volatility periods.\n* Liquidity depth and market integration have been *increasing* month over month, with more institutional-grade market makers participating.\n* Solana has more active users than all major Ethereum L2s *combined* during most periods.\n* The current price still reflects outdated skepticism from the 2022 era, while on-chain metrics show network growth and adoption.\n\n# Common criticisms are outdated or wrong.\n\nThe majority of pushback against Solana is based on narratives rather than facts. The three most common objections are easy to address.\n\n**Centralization**  \nSolana has one of the largest validator sets in crypto and a high Nakamoto coefficient. It is more decentralized in practice than every rollup and sidechain that depends on a multisig or sequencer. It is decentralized enough for open global finance. Anything beyond that is philosophy.\n\n**Venture capital control**  \nVC unlocks are already behind us. Distribution has decentralized through open markets. If VC presence was a problem, then nearly every large crypto project would also be invalid.\n\n**Outages**  \nThe network had performance failures during its early period. They were fixed. The improvements now include local fee markets, quality of service rules, and a second independent validator client from Jump Crypto called Firedancer.\n\nNone of these arguments hold up. They only persist as talking points for people who stopped learning about Solana back in 2021.\n\n# Unified liquidity is a critical advantage\n\nSolana has a single shared state. All applications operate in one place. There is no fragmentation by design. Liquidity moves freely across the network. Ethereum is pursuing modular scaling through L2s and rollups which introduces risk, synchronization delays, fragmented liquidity, and user friction. The experience of bridging funds across multiple networks is not sustainable for mass adoption. Solana avoids this problem entirely.\n\n# Institutional flow will enter Solana\n\nCapital rotates in predictable patterns. Bitcoin first, Ethereum second, high conviction L1 third. That third position used to be a rotating story. Cardano, Polkadot, Avalanche all had their brief window. None developed real network effects. Solana did. It now has the liquidity depth and exchange integration required for institutional accumulation. Once the regulatory structure catches up, it will be added to portfolio models the same way Ethereum was in 2020.\n\n# Timeline and price logic\n\nSolana is not a 10 year hold to maybe see returns. It is a 2 to 3 year asymmetric play with a structural repricing window. If Solana captures a reasonable percentage of on-chain global transaction flow then a fair market value is\n\n* 1,000 at approximately 440 billion market cap\n* 2,000 at approximately 880 billion market cap\n* 3,000 at approximately 1.3 trillion market cap\n\nThese numbers are realistic inside a 10 trillion total crypto market by 2027 or earlier. Network effects always look impossible until they become obvious. There was a time when people thought Ethereum would never reach a 500 billion market cap. That era is over. The same disbelief now sits in front of Solana.\n\n# The window will not stay open\n\nThere will be a bear market before Solana reprices. That bear market will take Solana under current prices. That decline will cause retail holders to exit and panic. That event will not change the long term thesis. It will not impact the network. It will not reverse adoption. It will simply transfer supply from weak hands to strong ones.\n\nThe correct strategy over the next 2 to 3 years is accumulation, not reaction. For me, that means steady purchasing and staking through Phantom. I am not trading Solana. I am building position weight and yield. Whether price goes down or up in the short term is irrelevant to the thesis.\n\nSolana has already won the application layer. Transactions, developers, liquidity, products, integrations, and user adoption all confirm this. The only area that has not yet moved is price. That will change during the next expansion cycle. Market disbelief will disappear. Analysts will begin publishing revised price targets. Institutions will include Solana in their allocation models. It will go from a high conviction play to a consensus trade. By that time, the entry window will be gone.\n\nSolana should already be worth 1,000. It will get there. The only question is who will hold it when it does.\n\nThis is the most undervalued asset in crypto. The market has not priced it correctly. This is the biggest opportunity in crypto in the past five years.",

    "selftext": "When that $19 billion liquidation event hit last Friday, it basically turned into a real world stress test for every major blockchain. And it revealed something big about how Solana and Ethereum behave under pressure.\n\nSolana held up. Ethereum didn’t.\n\nLet’s look at the actual performance data.\n\nDuring peak chaos, Solana was processing around 1,200 to 1,300 transactions per second (TPS). Block finality stayed near 400 to 450 milliseconds, and while fees spiked briefly, they only went up to $0.20 to $0.30 per transaction before dropping back below a cent. The network stayed stable with no major slowdowns or congestion.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, was limited to roughly 13 to 15 TPS on the base layer (not 26). Block times extended to 14 to 15 seconds, and gas fees jumped above $500 per transaction at peak congestion, according to Etherscan data. That made the network effectively unusable for most people, transactions stalled, and many wallets and DeFi positions couldn’t execute because users were priced out.\n\nAs one treasury firm, DefDevCorp, put it: “If your gas fees make the network inaccessible, it’s the same as being offline.” In contrast, Solana stayed operational throughout, proving the recent upgrades to Firedancer, QUIC, and stake weighted QoS have strengthened network performance.\n\nCrypto researcher Aylo shared that during the crash, he could rebalance and move funds on Solana easily, while his Ethereum positions were frozen due to extreme gas costs. That’s a real world example of how Solana’s architecture built for high throughput performs differently from Ethereum’s more conservative, security focused base layer.\n\nEthereum’s scaling solutions (like Arbitrum and Base) help under normal conditions, but the mainnet still bottlenecks during global panic moments. And that’s when Solana shines, not because it’s perfect, but because it was designed for speed from the ground up.\n\nThis is more than just a one day win. Solana’s had over 20 months of uptime since early 2023, a major improvement after its earlier reliability issues. Ethereum’s ecosystem is still much larger and more decentralized, but in raw throughput and stability under stress, Solana’s catching serious attention.\n\nIf these patterns continue, where Solana stays usable during chaos and Ethereum slows down, that could shift how institutions and DeFi protocols allocate capital. Traders and developers want reliability when the market’s melting down, not just during quiet times.\n\nAnd that’s exactly the mindset driving projects like Awaken, which are building directly on Solana to take advantage of its real-world performance edge.

Queue Changes\n2. » The time-based queue is removed.\n3. » Going forward, only the Ecosystem Contributor path remains.\n4. » Validators now need to actively add value to the ecosystem (tools, infrastructure, community support)\n5. Why is the Foundation doing this?\n6. » Focus resources on validators adding tangible network value.\n7. » Reduce dependency on Foundation stake → more decentralized, self-sustaining network.\n8. » Encourage new entrants to demonstrate capability & attract real delegations.\n\nHow this affects validators?\n\n\\> Validators in the time-based queue feel their years of effort and financial investments are being invalidated.  \n\\> Small validators (<100k SOL) often lose money: hardware + vote tx costs exceed rewards.  \n\\> Medium validators (100–200k SOL) near breakeven under current network\n\n<> Many small validators may shut down, centralizing stake in larger operators.  \n<> Network stability could be impacted if remaining validators cut redundancy or reduce spare nodes.\n\nValidator Strategy Going Forward:  \n» The Foundation is prioritizing value-adding participants over passive stake holders.  \n» Focus on ecosystem contributions (RPC, monitoring, MEV tools, community projects).  \n» Attract external delegations - rely less on SFDP stake.  \nOptimize node efficiency (Alpenglow, Firedancer/Agave updates)\n\nSFDP is now a launchpad, not a crutch.

The only thing I’d change is fee visibility and polish a design a little bit; users don’t see exact costs before claiming, which can make tracking hard.\n* **Claim Your SOL:** Works fine but the fee was big **20%**, which felt high compared to others. The UI is clean but limited if you’ve got a lot of accounts to close.\n* **Unclaimed SOL:** (ours) Returned the most SOL on average and scans for the most opportunities. Fee is exactly **5%**.\n\nThe goal here isn’t to bash anyone - all three tools serve the same purpose and help keep Solana wallets clean.  \nI just wanted to provide data so users can make an informed choice.\n\nHere’s the full write-up with tables and fee comparisons if you want the full context:  \n👉 [https://blog.unclaimedsol.com/claim-most-sol-comparison/](https://blog.unclaimedsol.com/claim-most-sol-comparison/)\n\nCurious if anyone else here has compared their results?

    "selftext": "If you're tired of those pesky compute unit (CU) limits cramping your DeFi dreams, we've got some seriously bullish news straight from Anza. Today, they dropped a game-changing proposal (SIMD-0266) to overhaul the SPL Token Program with a hyper-efficient replacement called p-token. Authored by 0x\\_febo, this upgrade could slash token operation costs by up to 98%, freeing up nearly 12% of block space for more transactions. That's right—Solana's already blazing-fast network just got a turbo boost on paper.\n\nWhy This Matters: More Txns, Less FrictionRight now, about 10% of Solana's block compute units are gobbled up by token instructions alone. With p-token, those costs drop dramatically, directly pumping up the chain's effective throughput. Imagine running complex DeFi flows—swaps, transfers, mints—without hitting CU walls as often. This isn't just a tweak; it's a direct capacity unlock that plays nice with other upgrades like 100M CU blocks and higher account limits.  \nThe Tech Breakdown: Efficiency Without the HeadacheP-token is a full reimplementation of the SPL Token Program, but don't worry—it's 100% backward compatible. No code changes needed for clients or dApps; it's a drop-in replacement. Here's what makes it tick:\n\n* No heap allocations: Ditches memory overhead for leaner ops.\n* Zero-copy data access: Reads data straight from accounts without unnecessary copying.\n* New killer instructions:\n   * Batch: Bundle multiple token ops into one cross-program invocation (CPI).\n   * UnwrapLamports: Skip creating temp native accounts for lamport handling.\n\nCheck out this chart from Anza showing the CU smackdown across common instructions (P-Token in green vs. SPL in purple):\n\n|Instruction|SPL Token CUs|P-Token CUs|% Savings|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|TransferChecked|6,200|105|98%|\n|Transfer|4,645|76|98%|\n|CloseAccount|4,240|120|97%|\n|InitializeAccount3|2,916|248|92%|\n|InitializeImmutableOwner|3,045|1,404|54%|\n|SyncNative|381|38|90%|\n|InitializeAccount|4,527|154|97%|\n\nNeodyme's audit replayed mainnet transactions and confirmed p-token spits out identical results to the current SPL program. No funny business—just pure efficiency gains. This could supercharge everything from Jupiter swaps to custom AMMs, making Solana even more dev-friendly.\n\n[https://x.com/anza\\_xyz/status/1980301099694539045](https://x.com/anza_xyz/status/1980301099694539045)",

    "selftext": "Maybe it’s just me, but BSOL’s first day didn’t feel like a cultural event the way early BTC or even ETH ETF launches did. Volume was solid, flows look promising, and GSOL’s conversion tomorrow adds heft. Yet the noise level is… muted. No meme tsunami, fewer victory laps, more “cool, noted” from the timeline.\n\nThat’s not necessarily bad. In 2021, retail FOMO plus social hype were jet fuel… and whipsaw risk. Today’s setup is more methodical. Institutions can now get SOL through a ’33 Act wrapper on the NYSE… Bitwise priced it at 0.20% with a temporary fee waiver and even included staking… the fee war is very real. It’s efficient, but also kind of sterile. The adoption many of us wanted… just delivered in a suit and tie.\n\nContext matters too. Attention is fragmented. FinTwit is busy with AI mega-caps and macro. And psychology plays a role: a new SOL ETF is big for the ecosystem, but it doesn’t hit like “the first ever spot BTC ETF.” Once the category exists, follow…ons feel incremental… even if they move real capital over quarters.\n\nThe bull case is straightforward: if BTC and ETH are the “core,” SOL can become the “growth” leg for multi…asset mandates. If flows compound… if tracking stays tight… if distribution widens beyond day…one curiosity… $3B over 12…18 months isn’t crazy. The bear (or at least sober) case: early volume ≠ durable demand, and crypto ETP flows can be lumpy. Without persistent creations, spreads widen and enthusiasm fades.\n\nSmall note on the rest of the day’s launches… Canary’s Hedera and Litecoin ETFs listed on Nasdaq and are much smaller, so flows will probably be lighter than SOL.  \nOne interesting angle here… as more traditional investors gain exposure through ETFs, the tax side of crypto investing is about to get more layered. Swaps, staking rewards, conversions, and even ETF-based gains all feed into taxable events in different ways. It’s a good reminder that if you’re already balancing on-chain trades with new ETF exposure, tools like Awaken tax make life a lot easier by syncing wallets and exchange data automatically so you don’t end up sorting hundreds of transactions at year end.\n\nMy read: this is a legitimacy step, not a confetti cannon. The question isn’t “did it pop today?” It’s “does it keep showing up on statements for the next six earnings calls?” Anyone else feeling that shift… from hype cycles to slow, boring normalization?",

    "selftext": "If not for the government shutdown, the spot SOL ETFs (with staking) would already have been approved. When will they be available to trade in the U.S.? Nobody knows for sure. Hopefully, this will cause SOL to go way up and at least double in the next several months, from 200 to 400+. Personally, I recently got the 2X SOL ETF called SOLT which is already available, and if SOL doubles to 400 or more (which is my belief), then this 2X SOL ETF should do EVEN BETTER and may go from 20 to about 80.\n\nThis is what came up on a google search:\n\nIt is possible that some spot Solana (SOL) ETFs could be available to trade in the U.S. tomorrow, October 28, 2025. Some exchanges appear to be moving forward with listings despite the ongoing government shutdown. However, the U.S. government shutdown has created uncertainty regarding the official launch date, as final Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval is delayed for many applicants. \n\nKey details\n\n* **NYSE listings:** On Monday, October 27, 2025, the New York Stock Exchange posted listing notices for several spot crypto ETFs, including the Bitwise Solana Fund and the Grayscale Solana Trust.\n* **Bitwise Solana Staking ETF:** This fund received certification from NYSE Arca on Monday, October 27, with trading potentially beginning as soon as Tuesday, October 28.\n* **Government shutdown:** The SEC has not been able to process all of the necessary S-1 filings due to the shutdown, which complicates the launch for most applicants.\n* **21Shares ETF:** The 21Shares Solana ETF has already been registered on the Cboe BZX Exchange, having received provisional approval from the SEC. However, its final trading review was on hold due to the government shutdown.\n* **Other applicants:** Firms like Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, CoinShares, and VanEck have also filed applications and are awaiting regulatory action. \n\nImportant context\n\nWhile some funds might start trading, the situation is complex due to the government shutdown impacting official SEC procedures. Investors should confirm the listing status of specific ETFs with their brokerage before attempting to trade. \n\n[https://coincentral.com/nyse-approves-bitwise-solana-staking-etf-will-it-shake-crypto-markets/](https://coincentral.com/nyse-approves-bitwise-solana-staking-etf-will-it-shake-crypto-markets/)\n\n[https://coinedition.com/bitwise-ceo-teases-big-week-hinting-at-major-progress-in-sol-etf-application-process/](https://coinedition.com/bitwise-ceo-teases-big-week-hinting-at-major-progress-in-sol-etf-application-process/)\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/27/nyse-lists-solana-hedera-litecoin-spot-crypto-etfs-for-trading-this-week](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/27/nyse-lists-solana-hedera-litecoin-spot-crypto-etfs-for-trading-this-week)\n\n[https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/solana-etfs](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/solana-etfs)",

    "selftext": "A Nasdaq listed company, Solana Company (formerly Helius Medical Technologies, ticker HSDT), announced it has accumulated over 2.2 million SOL tokens as part of its new corporate treasury strategy.\n\nAt current prices around $232 to $235, the company’s SOL holdings are worth approximately $525 million. Combined with its cash reserves, the total value of its assets now exceeds $530 million, surpassing the gross proceeds raised during its private placement in September.\n\nCosmo Jiang from Pantera Capital, who serves as a board observer, compared their approach to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy at MicroStrategy and Tom Lee’s model at Bitmine. Jiang stated that the company is “efficiently accumulating SOL to maximize shareholder value.”\n\nCEO Joseph Chee added that institutional demand for Solana exposure has been stronger than expected, particularly after recent digital asset conferences in Asia. This indicates growing institutional interest in Solana as a treasury asset, not just from retail investors.\n\nSolana Company becomes one of the first publicly traded firms to hold SOL as a primary balance sheet asset, similar to how MicroStrategy uses Bitcoin and Bitmine uses Ethereum. When public companies hold crypto on their balance sheet, it creates consistent demand that is less tied to short term retail sentiment.\n\n2.2 million SOL represents a substantial portion of circulating supply being locked by a single entity, reducing available liquidity in the market. If more public companies follow this model, it could create steady buying pressure similar to Bitcoin’s corporate treasury wave.\n\nWhether Solana Company’s stock trades at a premium like MicroStrategy’s remains to be seen, but this move marks an important moment for corporate adoption of Solana as a treasury asset.",

    "selftext": "October 11th, 2025 marked DeFi’s **most severe stress test to date.**\n\n\n\nWhat many thought to be the next leg up quickly turned into the largest Black Swan event in crypto history. In a matter of hours, a cascade of liquidations tore through decentralized markets on all chains. Over **$19 billion in collateral** was wiped out as asset prices plunged, gas fees spiked, and oracle wicks widened the pain. Borrowers saw vaults erased, lenders saw yields evaporate, and stability mechanisms were tested across every major lending protocol.\n\n\n\nBillions were liquidated, but not all losses were equal. Individual protocols have different means of protection against crises such as this one. Depending on where you were trading, the same position would have ended up with a different outcome.  \n  \nI’ve gathered three of the most prominent DeFi protocols to see who combatted this price action most effectively, and how their users faired:\n\n\n\n# 1. Drift\n\nI wanted to start with Drift because they have a unique approach to activating liquidation thresholds. A total of $76 million was wiped out on Drift alone, but the platform incurred **zero** bad debt. This was primarily thanks to four main features :\n\n# 1. Oracle Price, not Mark Price\n\nMany speculate this is where Binance went wrong last week. Mark Price is a method of calculating the price of assets internally derived from oracle pricing, but factoring in other considerations.This can be a slippery slope and cause widespread depegging; precisely what users of Binance experienced. Drift stays away from this, and goes even further than solely using oracle price to prove extra layers of security to traders on their platform.  \n\n\n# 2. 5 Minute TWAP \n\nDrift liquidates based on a 5 Minute Time-Weighted Average price. Out of the 4,608 users at risk on their platform, almost half (2,303) were saved by these guardrails. Liquidations are blocked based on a 50% divergence between the oracle price and the oracle’s 5 minute TWAP (thank you Chris Pheaney).\n\n\n\n# 3. Partial Liquidations\n\nAll it takes is one unfavorable wick to entirely wipe out your position. At least, that’s how it usually goes. On Drift, liquidations are done on a slightly larger time frame, 10 seconds was given as an example, to give time for price stabilization. Another method of combatting god candles in the wrong direction.   \n\n\n# 4. Drift’s Insurance Fund/AMM\n\nWhen all else fails and bad debt starts to build, Drift has a robust USDC Insurance Fund to cover any losses. It’s sourced by both protocol revenue and external stakers. Those who deposited into the Insurance Fund made 600K from this event alone.\n\n\n\nNot to mention, Drift currently has the highest OI - Volume Ratio post-dump, so it seems users are relatively satisfied with their performance this past weekend. All in all, no socialized losses were incurred across all of their perp users, and if they had been, they would be spread out pro-rata ( @cindyleowtt).  \n  \nNo downtime, no user losses,  I am impressed to say the least. ([@tracybbd ](https://x.com/tracybbd)[https://x.com/tracybbd/status/1979027380355162615](https://x.com/tracybbd/status/1979027380355162615)[ )](https://x.com/tracybbd)\n\n\n\n# 2. Kamino\n\n\n\n8,103 liquidations spread across 1,671 wallets. Coincidentally, Kamino improved their liquidation engine barely over a month before all of this happened. Unlike other major DeFi protocols, Kamino doesn’t offer an insurance protocol, but still is able to boast an incredible $0 bad debt accrued. Here’s what’s helped them maintain that:\n\n1. **Auto-deleveraging**\n\nWhen an asset's supply or borrow amount is considered too risky, K-Lend’s auto-deleveraging mechanism kicks in automatically. Partial liquidations now occur in 10% increments preventing your entire position from being wiped out at once. Additionally, penalties for liquidation are as low as 0.1% as of early September. This is 10x better than they performed before.\n\n\n\n[https://x.com/KaminoFinance/status/1962568881333019033/video/1](https://x.com/KaminoFinance/status/1962568881333019033/video/1) (video from Kamino as graphic showing partial unwinding) \n\n# 2. Dynamic Interest Rates\n\nWith a poly-linear interest rate curve, Kamino’s constantly changing interest rates keep things stable by encouraging:\n\n* lenders to supply into the market\n* borrowers to repay debt\n\nBy implementing this, users are encouraged to actively monitor their positions; thus, be aware of large liquidation events occurring.\n\n# 3. Kamino’s Risk Council\n\nDuring extreme events, Kamino’s core team works alongside DeFi industry leaders such as SteakhouseFi and Re7 Labs to safeguard the platform. They have the power to manually deleverage,, unwind positions, and more when deemed necessary. It’s an added layer of comfort to an already heavily audited and secure protocol.\n\n\n\nSince launching in 2023, they have retained **zero** bad debt through $140M + in liquidations with no insurance fund needed. They continue to bring new innovations to how they perform liquidations when necessary, and have the second highest TVL out of protocols on Solana for a reason. If you’d like a more in-depth breakdown of Kamino during this timeframe, I thank AllezLabs put together a substantial summary and providing us with plenty of insightful data. ([https://x.com/AllezLabs/status/1977386055704997898](https://x.com/AllezLabs/status/1977386055704997898))\n\n# 3. Hyperliquid\n\nThe behemoth of all perps platforms, Hyperliquid, was put to the test with this being their first Black Swan event since inception. Maintaining billions of perps volume on the daily over the last few months; they took the blunt of liquidations suffer\n\n# HLP Vault\n\nThe Hyperliquid Liquidity Provider vault, or HLP for short, provides liquidity to the orderbooks and makes market-making possible on Hyperliquid. ( thanks CEO Jeff ). For the first time in over two years, the HLP failed, and Hyperliquids’ Cross-margin Auto-deleveraging system kicked in. For those who might be unfamiliar with this mechanism, it works like this:\n\n\n\n1. User’s position/account falls below the required maintenance margin and is now undercollateralized (in this case, due to a sharp drop in prices form the oracle)\n2. A liquidation is triggered and sent to the orderbooks to buy/sell at market price\n3. Due to extreme volatility, the orderbooks are slammed and the position cant be fully exited\n4. The HLP (Hyperliquidity-Provider) vault assumes ownership of the remaining collateral to exit the position once some time has passed and things have stabilized\n5. If the HLP liquidation backstop is not enough, ADL begins to kick in.\n\n# Cross Margin ADL\n\nAs you know now, a lot has to happen to get to this point. Once there, users are given a rank, and  those with the highest unrealized PNL and larger leverage are put on the chopping block first. They begin to have their positions automatically deleveraged to cover any outstanding bad debt. This is when people took to CT to let their complaints be heard, but the stats don't lie:  \n  \n\n\n* <20 mins for HLP to liquidate billions of $\n* 100% uptime\n* No bad debt\n\n\n\nHyperliquid operated exactly as intended, and showed us why it’s number one in the perps space across all chains.\n\n# A Win For DeFi\n\nAcross the board, DeFi is stepping up. Loopscale maintained zero bad debt. Projec Zero protected 100% of user solvency across 2,000+ liquidations—only $1.8M liquidated thanks to partial liquidations that bring users back to health instead of wiping them out entirely. Orca held the line when other proprietary AMMs pulled liquidity and left users stranded.  \n  \n[https://x.com/0xGumshoe/status/1977781022184878252](https://x.com/0xGumshoe/status/1977781022184878252)\n\nHad this happened three years ago—hell, even two—we would've seen protocol insolvencies, immense socialized losses, and cascading failures across the ecosystem. Instead, we saw transparent liquidation engines, robust insurance mechanisms, and oracle systems that held under pressure.\n\nOn October 11th, CEXs went down, their trust went with it, and DeFi didn't even flinch. This is the real-world proof of what DeFi offers and TradFi can't.\n\nBut this is just the beginning. The value prop is there—now imagine where it's going. Automation, agents, the possibilities are truly endless. 24/7 position monitoring, pre-liquidation rebalancing, cross-protocol optimization in milliseconds. If DeFi can survive this stress test with manual infrastructure, what happens when agentic workflows take over?\n\nThe foundation is set. Automation is coming. TradFi has no choice but to take notice.\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Article from [cryptoinflation.eu](http://cryptoinflation.eu) :  \n  \nMost dashboards show a single “inflation rate” for Solana. That number isn’t *wrong*—it just describes **policy minting**, not the **growth of tradable (circulating) supply** that markets actually feel. In this article, we will take a look at theese two sides of the same coin and explain the differences.\n\n# 1) What the official inflation rate is\n\nSolana’s protocol sets an **annual inflation parameter** and mints new SOL proportionally over time, distributing it to the staked set (validators + delegators). Conceptually:\n\n* `r_annual` — protocol’s annual inflation parameter (decimal, e.g., 0.07 for 7%)\n* `S_start` — total SOL supply at the start of a period\n* `Δt` — length of the epoch (seconds)\n* `Y` — seconds per year (e.g., 31,536,000)\n\n**Exact time-proportional mint for one epoch**\n\n    Mint_epoch = S_start * ( (1 + r_annual)^(Δt / Y) - 1 )\n\nAnnualizing across many epochs reproduces the **official** or **policy inflation**. That figure answers:\n\n>\n\n**Important:** This is about **minted supply** by design. It does **not** attempt to measure the market float.\n\n[Solana’s official inflation rate. Source: https:\\/\\/docs.anza.xyz\\/implemented-proposals\\/ed\\_overview\\/ed\\_validation\\_client\\_economics\\/ed\\_vce\\_state\\_validation\\_protocol\\_based\\_rewards](https://preview.redd.it/j1g1pdz41atf1.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=018509bfb121f9aa195bcd0597df9bb9a27c9dff)\n\n# 2) Why “policy minting” ≠ “what the market feels”\n\nTwo parallel ideas often get conflated:\n\n* **Monetary (total) supply inflation** — how much the **total** supply changes after accounting for burns and other adjustments.\n* **Circulating (float) inflation** — how much the **tradable/circulating** supply changes, which also depends on unlocks and treasury movements.\n\nThe official number targets minting; **net supply** and **circulating** each add their own layers.\n\n# 3) Circulating (float) inflation (market view)\n\nMany readers care about the growth of **circulating** supply—the coins that can trade. Unlocks and treasury moves matter here.\n\nLet:\n\n* `Circ_T0`, `Circ_T1` — circulating supply at start/end\n* `Unlocks` — previously non-circulating SOL that entered circulation\n* `Relocks` — SOL that left circulation (vesting/escrow/treasury moves)\n* `Treasury_Moves` — any policy-relevant reclassifications affecting float (foundation spending, grants, etc.)\n\nObserved change:\n\n    ΔCirc_observed = Circ_T1 - Circ_T0\n\nYou can decompose it (optional, for clarity):\n\n    ΔCirc_observed = (Real_Issuance - Burns_effect_on_circulating) + Unlocks - Relocks + Treasury_Moves\n\nThen the float inflation rate:\n\n    CircInfl_window = ΔCirc_observed / Circ_T0\n    CircInfl_annualized = (1 + CircInfl_window)^( Seconds_per_year / Seconds_in_window ) - 1\n\n**Key distinction:** Unlocks and treasury distributions **do not mint** new SOL; they change **who can sell it**, so they affect **circulating**, not **total** supply.\n\n[Market inflation rate from https:\\/\\/www.cryptoinflation.eu\\/coin\\/solana](https://preview.redd.it/wqjclvyk1atf1.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=359dd24cbe18fcb583f1f71f5aa7eadad070e333)\n\n# 4) Reconciling the perspectives\n\n* **Official (policy) inflation**: what the protocol intends to mint per year.\n* **Circulating inflation**: how the tradable float changed after unlocks/treasury activity and burns.\n\n# Bottom line\n\nThe **official Solana inflation rate isn’t wrong**—it’s just a **policy measure of minting**. Markets often care more about **net supply** (after burns) and **circulating float** (after unlocks/treasury moves).",

    "selftext": "Been building/testing on Solana for a while now, and it's wild how much the developer and user experience has improved compared to 2021-2022.\n\nRemember when interacting with Solana dApps meant:\n\n* Phantom constantly disconnecting\n* Transactions timing out 50% of the time\n* Zero visibility into what's happening on-chain\n\nNow? Multi-chain tools are actually treating Solana as a first-class citizen, not an afterthought.\n\nExample: was testing Banana Pro recently for on-chain automation. It's cross-chain (ETH + SOL), but the Solana implementation is genuinely smoother than the EVM side. Fast confirmations, minimal friction, no bridge nonsense.\n\nThe fact that you can now build UIs on Solana that feel like... normal web apps (not \"please approve 5 transactions and pray\") is a huge shift.\n\nWhat I'm noticing:\n\nWallet integrations are stable now (Phantom, Backpack, Solflare all work consistently)\n\nTransaction simulation before signing is becoming standard\n\nGas fees still mog everything else (even during high congestion)\n\nQuestion for builders here: What Solana-native tools are you using that you wish existed 2 years ago? Feels like we're finally at the point where UX isn't the main barrier anymore.",

    "selftext": "TLDR. Bitwise’s CEO said at Token2049 that Solana’s faster unstake process could make it easier to package for a staking ETF than Ethereum.\n\nThe claim is about plumbing, not hype. Fund desks need smooth creations and redemptions. Shorter exit times and predictable staking flows make their jobs simpler.\n\nThe SEC has updated rules for listing spot crypto ETFs. That can shorten timelines when products meet the requirements. In that world, clean operations matter more.\n\nThis is one company’s view, not an approval. What actually ships will depend on custody, staking setup, and risk controls. Timelines can still slip.\n\nIf a Solana staking ETF lands, what must it include. Broad validator distribution. Clear fee disclosure. On chain reporting of stake moves. No reuse of customer assets without consent. What else would make you trust it.\n\nFor holders considering staking strategies around potential ETF launches, tax treatment matters regardless of whether you're staking directly or through a fund. Staking rewards hit as income when received, then basis tracking on those rewards when you eventually sell. Been using awaken to handle this automatically since manually logging daily staking drops and their USD values at receipt time isn't realistic at scale. The lot tracking becomes critical when you're staking meaningful amounts over time.\n\nThe operational advantage Solana has on unstaking speed is real for fund mechanics, but the regulatory path and institutional custody setup will determine timing more than technical specs.",

Knowledge is the real flex here.\n\n1) Quantified Network Value: Solana generates an estimated $5 Billion in annualized transaction fees, a metric comparable to major centralized payment networks. Its DeFi platform facilitate $1.2 Trillion in trading volume YTD.\n\n2) Institutional Confidentiality Bridge: Solana is emerging as a \"ZK powerhouse\", integrating Zero-Knowledge technology to enable crucial, confidential computations and private DeFi transactions.\n\n3) The Strategic Imperative: This ZK integration bridges the platform's unparalleled performance with the necessary confidentiality required by institutional actors for large-scale, proprietary trading and financial operations.\n\nSolana's economic activity is validated. Does this strong fundamental utility override concerns, or is the long-term investment justified only if the ZK privacy roadmap successfully implements perfect institutional-grade confidentiality?",

Get up to speed with the latest report from our research team.  \n🧵⬇\n\n\n\n>**2/** Solana is a smart contract platform blockchain that stands out for the depth and diversity of its on-chain activity. Today it’s the category leader in terms of users, transaction volume, and transaction fees — arguably the three most important measures of blockchain activity.\n\n\n\n>**3/** Smart contract blockchains are networks that host applications, and Solana is home to industry-leading applications across an impressive range of functions, including\n\n>[u/RaydiumProtocol](https://x.com/RaydiumProtocol) (a decentralized exchange), [@pumpdotfun](https://x.com/pumpdotfun) (a consumer app), and [@helium](https://x.com/helium) (a network for mobile hotspots).\n\n\n\n>**4/** Measuring the Solana ecosystem should take into account transaction activity on both the blockchain itself and its hosted applications. Although there’s variation over time, the Solana ecosystem earns about $425 million in fees per month¹ — or more than $5 billion annualized.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gk9q7rdj2pvf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=d698f4c313eef56f95b3e07fce9b13c3b3a7f62c\n\n>**5/** Solana has managed to stand out in a competitive market by offering fast and cheap transactions, a compelling new-user experience and, in our view, partly by going its own way.\n\n\n\n>**6/** The network produces new blocks every 400 milliseconds, and transactions can be considered final in about 12–13 seconds. In addition to high throughput, transaction costs have remained relatively low: users have paid an average transaction fee of just $0.02 year to date.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vccel4an2pvf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=edd8ace60ad62330c74d22c48180e570aa2b10ab\n\n>**7/** Today there are more than 1,000 full-time developers working on Solana. This human capital could contribute to ongoing Solana-dedicated innovation over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gr6nogf73pvf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab64644f20d2990933f704ec4f1efcbe51b294f0\n\n>**8/** The [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) token is a digital commodity that helps operate the network and provides investment access to growth in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f097ytg93pvf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=21fe306995a7f01c0d0a48a379171b857e2becad\n\n>**9/** The supply of [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) tokens currently increases at a rate of about 4%–4.5% per year². This can be considered a source of dilution for token holders, all else equal.\n\n\n\n>**10/** However, [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) stakers can receive a nominal reward rate of around 7%³, depending on network conditions. Therefore, [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) stakers earn a “real” (inflation-adjusted) reward rate of roughly 2.5%–3%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1d66n1u2pvf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad46f253a8bcc6a8fcfb1c816a09ecf022cd2ac2\n\n>**11/** Like other smart contract platform tokens, the investment thesis for the [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) token centers on potential growth in the size of the Solana network\n\n\n\n>**12/** if the Solana network grows over time — if it hosts more users, processes more transactions, and earns more fees — investors can anticipate a rising [$SOL](https://x.com/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click) price, in our view.\n\n\n\n>**13/** For more details check out the full [@solana](https://x.com/solana) report:  \n[https://research.grayscale.com/reports/solana-cryptos-financial-bazaar](https://research.grayscale.com/reports/solana-cryptos-financial-bazaar)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldwnp5r12pvf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccc611718303c689dc7f2e905839e2c3ee4005f0",

Figment brings battle-tested infrastructure (they were genesis validators for both ETH and SOL) plus top-notch security, compliance, and slashing protection.   \nFigment's CEO Lorien Gabel put it: “Beyond returns, staking in ETPs enables holders to participate in securing and processing transactions for the blockchain.” This could supercharge ETH and SOL flows into tradfi.  \n[Link](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251009122610/en/Grayscale-Selects-Figment-as-a-Staking-Provider-for-U.S.-ETH-ETPs-and-SOL-Trust)",

The true growth is now constrained by cryptography, not speed.\n\nThe core conviction is that FHE is the strategic imperative that turns Solana into a compliant venue for proprietary trading.\n\n1) Throughput vs. Privacy Conflict: Solana recorded $326 Billion in Q3 DEX volume, confirming its capacity for high-velocity activity. However, traditional public blockchain transparency is unsuitable for proprietary financial operations.\n\n2) The FHE Solution: Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows data to be processed on-chain while remaining encrypted. Zama's FHEVM is the protocol enabling this for confidential smart contracts.\n\n3) The Scalability Roadmap: The historical barrier is breaking.\nThe FHE roadmap targets 10,000+ TPS per chain via specialized ASICs. This is the necessary capacity to confidently bring global payments and high-volume institutional activity confidentially on-chain.\n\nInstitutional integration is inevitable. Is the investment strategy now focused on accumulating SOL based on the $500 target and current DEX volume, or is the strategic necessity to fund the specialized FHE hardware roadmap to solve the confidentiality problem?",

It currently supports buy and sell actions using contract addresses, but does not yet include the memescope feature – I plan to add that soon.\n\nThe Telegram version is already live as well.\n\nI’d really appreciate it if you could take a look and share your feedback. Your input will help improve the tool further.\n\nThanks in advance!  \n[https://simfi.fun/](https://simfi.fun/)",

Iris allows better splitting (up to 0.01%) and utilizes better routing algorithms like Golden-section and Brent’s method. We are seeing 100x performance improvements with the new routing algorithms.\n\nJupiterZ is our own RFQ system, which facilitates \\~$100M daily volume with zero slippage – exclusively available via Ultra v3.\n\nWith these, you get the best price possible, every time.\n\n>**Predictive Execution: Smart Route Prioritization For Superior Execution**\n\nOptimized for execution and slippage – not quote-optimized illusions.\n\nMost platforms “catfish” you with prices that don’t reflect the on-chain reality, or worse yet, mislead you into thinking they are showing the best price from Jupiter.\n\nPredictive Execution goes beyond just simulating routes. It accurately predicts potential slippage, intelligently prioritizes routes, and ultimately gives you the best possible outcome and price at the point of execution, not just at the point of quotation.\n\nOn top of that, Predictive Execution performs just in-time simulations for every route, uses signaling to help Prop AMMs to quote tighter for non-toxic flow versus toxic flow – allowing Jupiter Ultra users to get better pricing.\n\nWith this, quotes reflect actual likely on-chain execution, not theoretical best-case scenarios. No inflated “best prices” or tricks to delude.\n\nPredictive Execution also includes RTSE, the most advanced slippage estimator in DeFi, worked on for over 2 years.\n\nWhat you see is what you get. Every swap lands exactly as promised. Executed in the best way possible, at the best price, every time.\n\n>**Ultra Signaling: Even better pricing for Ultra Users**\n\nProp AMMs are a big deal recently because they can quote very tightly on-chain for users.\n\nBut they have to play defense with toxic traders like arb bots, toxic takers, etc. So, when quoting on-chain, they have to be careful to not quote too tightly (better price) to prevent being abused by these toxic traders.\n\nUltra Signaling is built directly on-chain on our Jupiter Aggregator contract to detect non-toxic flow on-chain. One of the Prop AMMs we are working with is now quoting 3 bps tighter (50% better) for our Ultra users with this signal.\n\n>**ShadowLane – Elite In-House Transaction Landing Engine**\n\nOur entirely brand new in-house transaction landing engine, ShadowLane, is built for sub-second precision and for incredible real-time data, as well as execution.\n\n\\- Private by design – no external relays, no order-flow sales.  \n\\- 3x more trades landed than alternative premium methods.  \n\\- Landing latency reduced – down from 1–3 blocks (400ms–1.2s) to 0–1 block (50–400ms).\n\nMassive effort from our newly formed RPC team led by [@italoacasas](https://x.com/italoacasas) with contributors to Yellowstone-gRPC, NFT DAS API, Lite-RPC, Agave, and more.\n\nThere will be so much more coming from this elite team, with work that will directly benefit the broader Solana ecosystem, stay tuned!\n\n>**Best-in-Class MEV Protection – 34x Better Than Top Trading Terminals**\n\nOther providers increase your risk of being sandwiched by selling your order flow to third-party MEV searchers.\n\nUltra v3 does the opposite – it minimizes your exposure to toxic MEV by ensuring your trades are never handed off to any external provider for on-chain execution.\n\nAnd while the risk isn’t zero (since validators still broadcast to the chain’s leaders), Ultra brings it as close to zero as possible.\n\nSafe. Private. Built Differently.\n\n>**RTSE – Real-Time Slippage Estimator**\n\nKnowing what slippage to set is always very difficult given volatile tokens, stablecoins, big caps, and different execution scenarios.\n\nThis is a challenge not just for new DeFi users, but for experienced traders as well.\n\nRTSE is our ongoing effort to solve this problem & uses important data points such as volume and transactions to improve outcomes. For v3 we have made a number of major changes, including:\n\n\\- Reduced RTSE slippage set while maintaining high success rates  \n\\- Automatic prioritization of slippage-protected routes over purely price-optimized routes  \n\\- Increased volatility sensitivity for tokens with high historical volatility patterns\n\nFor volatile tokens in particular, Ultra’s RTSE tightens the acceptable price range just enough to allow your swap to go through without overpaying for slippage.\n\n>**Enhanced Gasless Support**\n\nGasless Support, our just-in-time fee payer, allows you to trade without needing to hold SOL for gas fees.\n\nSo long as one token has a qualifying value during a trade, Ultra will compute the gas from your transaction, and pay for it with your swap.\n\nAnd now in v3 we have enhanced our Gasless Support, including expanded support (Token-2022 and memecoin-memecoin pairs), as well as lower minimum trade size (\\~$10).\n\nNow everyone with any asset in their wallet can make a trade.\n\n>**Just-In-Time Market Revival**\n\nUltra v3 achieves what other legacy routers cannot. It routes every token on Solana – even the dead and forgotten ones.\n\n\\- No minimum liquidity threshold  \n\\- Supports old, inactive markets  \n\\- Dynamically re-indexes on demand\n\nClose old positions, dump forgotten bags, trade everything.\n\nComplete coverage of the entire Solana ecosystem – exclusively on Ultra.\n\n>**Use Natively Across Web, Mobile & Desktop Wallet**\n\nJupiter has 3 world class surfaces that our users love:\n\n\\- **Web:** our full suite of Jupiter products including Portfolio, Swap, Pro, Perps, Lend, and more - giving you the most comprehensive DeFi experience and tools with best-in-class execution + protection, lowest fees, and smoothest design and UX  \n\\- **Jupiter Mobile:** 10x cheaper, 10x faster, 10x sexier – the best mobile trading experience (including native portfolio in a wallet and the sleekest UX), full PnL analysis, and easiest way to send and receive tokens or onboard anyone with just a link or QR  \n\\- **Jupiter Wallet for Desktop:** the most advanced Solana wallet as a desktop browser extension with gasless trading, deep integration with Jupiter products, PnL analysis, 10x lower fees than any other wallet - and synced with your Mobile wallet\n\nUltra v3 powers all these interfaces: Seamless. Consistent. Advanced.\n\nUltra execution, everywhere.\n\n>**Use Seamlessly With Pro Tools & Offerings**\n\nBuilt for Power Users – Ultra v3 is seamlessly integrated into every Pro tool:\n\n\\- Terminal: a command center for token metrics  \n\\- Screener for market discovery  \n\\- Portfolio + PnL for total visibility  \n\\- Alphascan for trending tokens + insights  \n\\- Analytics for data on transactions and traders\n\nEvery chart, every route, every trade – now fueled by Ultra precision.\n\n>**Legacy Jupiter Swap**\n\nAs part of this upgrade, moving forward we will be focusing our efforts on the ongoing development and improvement of Ultra v3 with our new router, Iris. We are also rolling out the Ultra API to allow our partners to utilize the best-in-class routing/transaction landing infra behind Ultra v3.\n\nCurrently, many meta routers and many others are still using our sunsetted Jupiter Legacy API (Metis). We will be working with them to upgrade their routing to adopt the new Ultra API.\n\nIf you are using Jupiter Legacy API in your app, please correctly label to avoid misleading your users that this is the best price from Jupiter. In particular, certain apps are using the free binary, which is deprecated and we have no control over the results, and it is very discouraging to see certain platforms abuse something that we have offered to the ecosystem for free for years.\n\n>**Ultra v3 Is Built for YOU.**\n\n**Use easily:** Zero config or adjustments needed for the best execution.\n\n**Use without worries:** Lowest fees possible, best protection, best-in-class transaction landing, unmatched customer service.\n\n**Use seamlessly:** Alongside our other world-class Pro tools like Terminal, Screener, Analytics.\n\n**Use natively:** Available on Mobile, Web, API, and Desktop.\n\nAnd of course, made with love by the hardest-working team striving to perfect your experience.\n\nJust use Jupiter.",

    "selftext": "Big news out of the SEC today that's got me genuinely excited for once – they've issued a No-Action Letter to the DoubleZero Foundation for their 2Z token, marking the first such relief for a crypto project in about 5 years. This isn't just a win for DoubleZero; it's a green light for DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) projects everywhere, clarifying that rewarding people for actual work on a blockchain network doesn't automatically make tokens \"securities.\"  \n\n\n* What's DoubleZero? It's a decentralized network built to optimize internet connectivity for high-performance stuff like blockchains. Think: a marketplace where people contribute underutilized fiber optic links (Network Providers) or handle maintenance/monitoring (Resource Providers) to boost bandwidth and reduce latency. The 2Z token powers payments, incentives, and security on this network.\n* The SEC's Take: After four months of back-and-forth, the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance reviewed how 2Z gets distributed \"programmatically\" (i.e., automatically as rewards for contributions). Their conclusion? No enforcement action needed because these aren't investment contracts under the Howey Test. Why? Contributors earn 2Z based on their own efforts – running nodes, providing storage, or sharing bandwidth – not from some promoter's managerial magic. Key quote from the letter:“The person who runs a node, provides storage, or shares bandwidth earns a reward. These tokens are neither shares of stock in a company, nor promises of profits.”In plain English: If you're actually building or maintaining the network, your token rewards are tied to utility, not speculation. No registration required under the Securities Act, and 2Z doesn't count as equity securities.\n* Why This Matters:\n   * For Builders: Ends the regulatory fog around token incentives. Projects can launch compliant token models in the US without fearing a Gensler-style smackdown.\n   * For DePIN: Validates models like Filecoin or Helium, where tokens reward real-world resources (bandwidth, storage) rather than \"passive investment returns.\"\n   * Broader Crypto Vibes: Signals a potential thaw in SEC-crypto relations. As one analyst put it, \"Crypto innovation in America is back.\"\n\nThe full SEC letter is [here](https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/doublezero-final-conformed-092625.pdf) – short read, worth it.  \nDoubleZero announced it on X: [Thread](https://x.com/doublezero/status/1972762875916869914)  \nAnd a16z's Miles Jennings broke it down: [Post](https://x.com/milesjennings/status/1972769027413168333)  \n",

    "selftext": "The recent market volatility exposed a massive, selective rotation of capital: institutional money isn't leaving the digital asset space, it's getting highly selective about where it repositions risk and liquidity within the altcoin ecosystem.\n\nThe core conviction is that Solana's resilience is built on the stability of proven assets, but its growth is challenged by adjacent retail capital misallocation. Knowledge is the real flex here.\n\n1) Selective Rotation Confirmed: While Bitcoin ETPs registered heavy outflows ($946 million), Solana funds saw inflows surge 67% to $156 million. This selective inflow underscores institutional preference for liquidity and proven ecosystems.\n\n2) Retail Capital Misallocation: This institutional repositioning occurs against a backdrop of retail capital rotating toward extremely high-risk, fundamentally unproven token launches, ignoring the quantified reality that 70% of new projects fail post-launch.\n\n3) Leverage Risk Proxy: The entire altcoin market structure is vulnerable to the concentrated risk found in high-leverage memecoin futures on volatile assets, a behavior often seen in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nInstitutional capital is funding its altcoin bets by selling BTC ETPs. Is the resilience in Solana sustainable based on this selective institutional accumulation, or is the immediate, overriding risk the mass capital loss coming from the 70% failure rate of unvetted, high-risk token launches adjacent to the ecosystem?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone — I’m experimenting with a small Python/Rust prototype to better understand Solana transaction flows. The idea is to:\n\t•\tStream wallet transactions in real time (RPC/WebSocket or other approaches)\n\t•\tTag / cluster wallets by repeated behavior (deployers, active traders, whales, etc.)\n\t•\tStore this data cleanly so I can later backtest and build filters for patterns\n\t•\tEventually connect this into MEV research — but with a focus on protective / ethical strategies (e.g., avoiding harmful sandwiching, exploring fair-ordering concepts, and looking at how validators/searchers handle flow on Solana).\n\nA couple of questions I’m running into:\n\t1.\tFor low latency streaming, are people here leaning on Solana Web3.js, Rust SDK, or direct RPC subscriptions?\n\t2.\tHow do you handle missed events if a websocket connection drops?\n\t3.\tAny tips on efficiently labeling wallets without ballooning storage/compute?\n\t4.\tFor those who’ve explored MEV in Solana — are there recommended frameworks or repos for researching it ethically (not exploit code, just analysis)? \n\nMy last post was removed — I think it wasn’t framed clearly enough as a technical/dev question. Just to be clear: I’m not asking about tokens or trading, only infra + data pipeline best practices.)\n",

    "selftext": "Hello guys, have you ever wondered what is the inflation rate and emission of your favourite cryptocurrency? If you’re into Solana, the answer isn’t static—it follows a **decaying issuance schedule** and interacts with **staking** and **network fees**. We built [**cryptoinflation.eu**](https://cryptoinflation.eu/) to make SOL’s supply dynamics easy to explain and compare with other chains.\n\nOn our Solana page you’ll find:\n\n* **Current annualized issuance** (protocol inflation) and how it has been **declining over time** toward a long-run rate.\n* **Historical curve & epoch views** so you can see the step-down of inflation and the effect of validator set changes.\n* **Net supply change** that factors in fee effects and any burns, giving you a cleaner picture of real dilution for holders.\n* **Staking context**: rewards come from inflation and fees; validator commission and stake distribution shape *yields*, while issuance shapes *dilution*.\n* **Comparisons** with PoW and other PoS networks to show how Solana’s decaying schedule differs from fixed or variable models.\n\nWhy it matters: the same market cap can hide very different dilution paths. Clear charts + plain-English notes help you discuss epochs, priority fees, and staking economics without spreadsheets.\n\nWe’d love feedback from Solana validators, builders, and educators: which extra metrics (e.g., effective inflation after fees, stake concentration overlays, MEV/priority-fee views) would make this most useful for dashboards, talks, or meetup slides?  \n**Link:** [https://cryptoinflation.eu](https://cryptoinflation.eu/)\n\n[Solana inflation and emission over the past 3 years](https://preview.redd.it/qov84ywysxsf1.png?width=1313&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb8da5bb765c8b5edb5ec37022e0a3194fd9a7d8)\n\n",

    "selftext": "# How to Make Solana Great Again?\n\nThis article aims to establish a targeted developmental strategy – the \"SOL Focus Strategy\" – under the grand narrative of ICM, covering areas from tokenomic model optimization to secondary ecological development. The north star goal of this strategy is to enhance SOL's value capture capability, thereby incentivizing ecological growth and aligning with the grand narrative of ICM.\n\n\n\n# 1. Tokenomic Model Adjustment\n\nSolana's current excessively high inflation rate has hindered ecological development, which is precisely why SIMD0228 was proposed. Therefore, adjusting Solana's inflation rate is imperative. But what should the specific adjusted rate be? We can first define several soft conditions to determine the final inflation rate and staking rewards:\n\n\n\n① A 2% terminal inflation rate is appropriate.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve also endorses this standard: in 2020, it explicitly incorporated the \"Average Inflation Targeting\" framework into its policy system. While it allows short-term inflation to slightly exceed 2% to offset periods of below-target inflation, it maintains 2% as the long-term core anchor, believing this level is most conducive to sustaining stable tokenomic growth. This logic equally applies to the long-term stable development of the Solana ecosystem.\n\n\n\n② SOL should avoid deflation.\n\nWhile SOL deflation may seem to drive price appreciation, we must recognize that Solana, as a high-performance blockchain infrastructure, should derive its value growth primarily from its own ecological development and performance improvements – not deflation. SOL deflation would reduce holders' willingness to deploy SOL in ecological use cases (such as staking, DeFi, and NFT transactions), which would suppress ecological vitality and innovation. Thus, deflation for SOL is undesirable.\n\n\n\n③ SOL's staking yield should exceed the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds.\n\nRWA (Real-World Assets) is a current hot trend and will be a key development direction in the future. It also serves as a critical narrative pillar aligned with the ICM strategy, as it will bring massive liquidity to the entire crypto industry and introduce products with real-world risk-free rates of return (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds). Consequently, the Solana ecosystem will inevitably integrate RWA products related to U.S. Treasury bonds.\n\n\n\nSOL's staking yield represents the native risk-free rate of return within the Solana ecosystem, and it will inevitably compete with RWA products. Given that U.S. Treasury bonds carry lower risk than Solana staking, SOL's staking yield must exceed that of U.S. Treasury bonds to remain competitive. Since the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds is approximately 4%, SOL's staking yield should ideally surpass this level.\n\n\n\n④ Should SOL earmark a portion of inflationary funds for long-term development? (This requires further consideration.)\n\nWould it enhance the attractiveness of the Solana ecosystem if a fixed percentage of the annual inflation rate were set aside as a dedicated treasury, with funds targeted allocated to long-term ecological development and reserved for contingency use? For details on how this treasury should be utilized, please refer to Section 3 below.\n\n\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nBased on the above soft conditions and Solana's foundational context, we can design an initial inflation rate of 3% for SOL:\n\n\n\n* 0.5% of this rate will be permanently directed to a treasury, ensuring a stable revenue stream for ecological development.\n* The remaining 2.5% will be used to reward staking participants.\n\n\n\nCurrently, Solana's staking ratio stands at 65% – a relatively high level. After the inflation adjustment, some stakers will be incentivized to unstake and redeploy SOL into the ecosystem to pursue higher returns. If the staking ratio stabilizes at 50%, validators can expect an approximate 5% yield, slightly exceeding the yield of U.S. Treasury bonds. This will maintain the healthy operation and attractiveness of the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n# 2. Stablecoin Strategy\n\nSolana needs a SOL-collateralized stablecoin.\n\n\n\n# Rationale:\n\nAt present, the relationship between many public chains and their ecosystems exhibits a zero-sum dynamic. For example, projects like [Pump.Fun](http://Pump.Fun) require SOL as the participation asset for their business model, allowing them to accumulate large amounts of SOL. However, when these projects realize profits, they often sell off SOL to strengthen their own operations – which restricts SOL's inherent growth.\n\n\n\nSecondly, SOL's price volatility directly impacts the development of many projects within the Solana ecosystem. The prosperity of the ecosystem is highly correlated with SOL's price, which contradicts real-world pricing mechanisms.\n\n\n\nIn traditional public companies, business operations (fiat-settled supply and demand systems) and stock markets (equity value systems) are inherently isolated: entity operations determine stock performance, but stock price fluctuations do not directly affect daily operations. For instance, even amid a stock market crisis, Luckin Coffee was able to maintain revenue growth through proactive business operations.\n\n\n\nHowever, the single-token system in the crypto world breaks this isolation: a single token simultaneously serves as the primary medium for the network's commercial scenarios (e.g., gas fees, entry tickets for application participation) and as an investment asset in the capital market.\n\n\n\nThis creates a risky \"double helix effect\": when the token price rises, market sentiment fuels false ecological prosperity; when the price plummets, developers' incomes decline sharply, leading to difficulties in project operation and maintenance. This is analogous to a project facing operational disruptions solely due to a sharp drop in its token price – a scenario that defies common sense yet is prevalent in the current crypto market.\n\n\n\nTherefore, ensuring that project operations are driven by supply-demand dynamics (rather than capital market fluctuations) is a critical challenge for Solana and the broader crypto market.\n\n\n\nReplacing the tokens used in commercial scenarios with stablecoins could address both issues mentioned above:\n\n\n\n* If Solana's ecological applications widely adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins, cashing out these stablecoins would significantly reduce selling pressure on SOL.\n* Meanwhile, SOL's price would no longer disrupt normal business operations, avoiding the double helix effect.\n\n\n\nOnce a large number of applications adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins for commercial use, a drop in SOL's price will not severely impact their operations. In turn, the stable operation of these ecological projects will provide support for the prices of both SOL and their own tokens.\n\n\n\nThis strategy will also lock up significant amounts of SOL within such stablecoin applications and spawn derivative applications similar to Curve. Additionally, large-scale stablecoin adoption can integrate with the payment ecosystem: an officially launched Solana Payment App could first support SOL-collateralized stablecoins, followed by USDT/USDC and other mainstream stablecoins.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the ICM strategy includes not only pure financial applications but also scenarios where traditional businesses are implemented via Web3. Such projects typically use stablecoins or fiat currencies (e.g., USD) for transactions. If Solana officially launches a SOL-collateralized stablecoin and establishes a dedicated entity to handle off-chain USD-to-on-chain stablecoin exchanges, it will attract more traditional businesses to Web3-ize their operations on Solana – further enriching the ecosystem.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, this stablecoin need not rely solely on SOL as collateral; it can also accept additional assets (e.g., ICM-related assets) as collateral. This would provide a use case for the large capital pools in ICM, enhance the stablecoin's utility by generating additional interest, and attract more users to adopt or hold it – accelerating the development of Solana's stablecoin ecosystem.\n\n\n\n# 3. Sustainable Development of SOL\n\nIn the real world, a common economic stimulus method involves:\n\n\n\n1. Collecting tax revenue into a treasury;\n2. Distributing a portion of the treasury as consumption vouchers to encourage spending;\n3. Generating new tax revenue through the commercial activities driven by this spending.\n\n\n\nThis creates a cycle that enables targeted stimulation of desired sectors while ensuring sustainable tokenomic development.\n\n\n\nThe same logic applies to public chains. Many public chains achieve cold start by launching incentive programs, collaborating with applications to attract users. Early users can earn both public chain rewards and application-specific incentives – a win-win scenario. However, many public chains lack sustainable incentive plans and token value capture mechanisms, leading to insufficient funds for long-term ecological incentives and hindering their long-term growth.\n\n\n\nThus, Solana's development requires a long-term incentive mechanism to achieve sustainability – which is why Section 1 proposes earmarking a portion of inflationary funds for a treasury.\n\n\n\n# Specific Uses of the Treasury:\n\nThe treasury's 0.5% share of the inflation rate will be allocated to five key areas (the exact percentage for each area can be further deliberated, but establishing such a treasury is essential for providing sustained, direction-driven support to Solana):\n\n\n\n① Regular incentives (e.g., quarterly) for users of applications with high TVL and transaction frequency. This is a long-term, permanent incentive direction aimed at increasing long-term SOL lock-up and driving more transaction-based burns – ultimately enhancing SOL's value capture from the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n② Periodic incentives for specific sectors: For example, one quarter may prioritize incentives for AI application projects, while the next quarter may focus on high-potential sectors like RWA. This mirrors government-specific funds, which provide targeted support for key industries.\n\n\n\n③ Targeted support for projects adopting SOL-collateralized stablecoins: Airdrops will be provided to users of projects with higher stablecoin adoption rates.\n\n\n\n④ Targeted support for ICM-aligned projects: Funding will be directed to projects that align with the ICM strategy.\n\n\n\n⑤ Development regulatory reserves: These funds will be locked in the treasury long-term and only deployed when the staking ratio is insufficient. Their purpose is to incentivize more participants to stake, ensuring Solana's network security.\n\n\n\n# Fine-Tuning the Burn Mechanism\n\nCurrently, Solana's burn mechanism operates as follows:\n\n\n\n* 50% of base fees are burned, and 50% are distributed to validators;\n* 100% of priority fees are distributed to validators.\n\n\n\nThis mechanism only burns approximately 0.3% of SOL's total supply, making it impossible to achieve the ideal 2% terminal inflation rate.\n\n\n\nPriority fees can be viewed as excess returns generated by Solana's network prosperity – and these returns should be aligned with SOL's value. This alignment would tightly bind network prosperity to SOL's value capture.\n\n\n\nFor these reasons, we propose revising the priority fee distribution to (The specific ratio can be further discussed.):\n\n\n\n* 70% to validators,\n* 20% burned,\n* 10% reverted to the treasury.\n\n\n\nThis adjustment will enable the treasury to benefit from ecological growth, creating a positive \"recovery-expenditure-recovery\" cycle. It will also enhance SOL's value capture from the ecosystem and, when combined with the treasury's regular incentives, accelerate burns and value capture – ultimately helping achieve the 2% terminal inflation rate target.\n\n\n\n# 4. The Necessity and Strategic Significance of Solana's Official Applications\n\nThe launch of official applications by public chains will become an inevitable trend, driven by three key factors:\n\n# ① Public chains need to control core applications\n\nCore applications play a crucial role in empowering the public chain's token and ensuring ecological stability. If core applications encounter issues, they can disrupt the development of other ecological projects. Thus, managing these applications in-house (by the public chain team) is optimal.\n\n\n\nFor example, Aerodrome – the DEX on Base – was co-launched by the Base team and Velodrome, an established DeFi team. Revenue from Aerodrome can be reinvested to support the Base team's operations. Even if Aerodrome faces issues, the public chain team can provide backup support. In contrast, third-party teams may struggle to recover from hacks or even execute rug pulls – resulting in significant ecological losses.\n\n\n\nExamples of such core applications include DEXs, over-collateralized stablecoin projects, and Curve-like protocols. These are all suitable for Solana to develop as official, native applications.\n\n\n\n# ② Public chains need to ensure core applications empower the native token (which is $SOL, not third-party tokens)\n\nEcological applications on public chains employ diverse business models and tokenomic mechanisms. Some accumulate large amounts of the public chain's token and lock in profits by selling it (e.g., Pump.Fun), creating selling pressure on SOL.\n\n\n\nIf Solana officially launches an application with the same functionality as [Pump.Fun](http://Pump.Fun), it can accumulate large amounts of SOL and manage it in ways that minimize ecological impact. For instance:\n\n\n\n* The revenue could be reinvested into over-collateralized stablecoin protocols to generate stablecoins, with profits used for ecological development;\n* Users could be required to use SOL-collateralized stablecoins to participate in the application.\n\n\n\nSuch designs would not only reduce negative ecological impacts but also increase demand for SOL and accelerate its value capture.\n\n\n\nA relevant case is Virtuals Protocol, which mandates that users use Virtual tokens to participate in its token launches. Additionally, newly issued tokens must form trading pairs with Virtual tokens to be traded. While this design partially stems from Base's lack of a native token, similar models are gaining traction on public chains with native tokens.\n\n\n\nTraditionally, new tokens would form trading pairs with the public chain's native token – a standard practice. However, designs like Virtuals' have led many projects to mandate trading pairs with their own tokens instead. This means value that would have been captured by the public chain's token is now siphoned off by third-party application tokens.\n\n\n\nTo counter this trend, public chain projects must directly compete for ecological empowerment.\n\n\n\n# ③ Competitive pressure from other public chains\n\nAn increasing number of \"public chain infrastructure + official applications\" combinations are emerging. The competitive edge derived solely from blockchain technology or ecological empowerment is diminishing; many projects are seeking ways to secure sustained external capital support for their blockchains – with exchange empowerment being the most effective and direct method.\n\n\n\nSome projects originated as applications and later expanded into public chains to develop their ecosystems. For example, HyperLiquid first launched a permissioned chain-based on-chain contract application, then built an EVM chain to grow its ecosystem – following a \"trading + public chain ecosystem\" logic. This model is being adopted widely: for instance, payment giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm are jointly incubating Tempo, a new blockchain project built specifically for stablecoin payments, which will likely follow a \"payment + public chain ecosystem\" logic.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Base Chain and BNBChain are typical examples of \"exchange giant + public chain ecosystem\" combinations, both leveraging CEXs to empower their public chains.\n\n\n\nThese models share a common trait: public chains are no longer satisfied with growth driven solely by on-chain applications. Instead, they are integrating off-chain cash flow-generating businesses with their ecosystems – importing additional positive external resources.\n\n\n\nIn the past, Solana's ecosystem was empowered by the FTX exchange, but no such external positive resources currently exist to continuously inject vitality into Solana. Collaborating with another exchange could lead to uncontrollable risks (like the FTX incident). Thus, Solana must build its own positive external empowerment.\n\n\n\n# Specific Actions Required:\n\nSolana needs to build a permissioned chain to host an official on-chain exchange (including spot and futures trading – a long-term goal). The rationale for developing this in-house (rather than assembling third-party projects) is that third-party projects cannot be built around SOL's value capture – they issue their own tokens and design business models to empower those tokens instead.\n\n\n\nSolana must expand its value capture from \"infrastructure only\" to \"infrastructure + official application suite.\" Revenue generated by official applications should be continuously reinvested into Solana's development, creating efficient synergy.\n\n\n\nA permissioned chain is necessary (rather than building directly on Solana's mainnet) because only permissioned chains can deliver performance and user experience comparable to CEXs – a key advantage of HyperLiquid.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, HyperLiquid's growing success demonstrates that on-chain contract and spot trading will be a key growth market in the future. This market will not be dominated by a single player; new competitors will inevitably emerge. Solana should enter this space early to compete.\n\n\n\nSolana's mainnet already hosts substantial capital, users, and projects – an official Solana-based HyperLiquid equivalent could reactivate the ecosystem, similar to how Coinbase empowers Base and Binance empowers BNBChain. Solana needs cash flow-generating applications to provide sustained external positive support for SOL – and it can even develop features that outperform HyperLiquid. For example, traditional institutions' core concerns about entering ICM are \"compliance and security\"; an official permissioned chain exchange could address these concerns through \"regulatory alignment + custody guarantees,\" serving as an \"institutional gateway\" to ICM.\n\n\n\nThis permissioned chain could be co-developed with Solana Layer2 Stack projects (e.g., HyperGrid or Other Layer 2 infrastructure teams, such as Altlayer), or built independently by Solana via its own Layer2 Stack. Developing a Layer2 Stack is critical for the broader ICM narrative, as traditional enterprises and investors typically enter on-chain tokenomic development through two paths:\n\n\n\n1. Building applications directly on a public chain;\n2. Launching their own managed and controlled Layer2s, then building application ecosystems on these Layer2s.\n\n\n\nThe latter path is preferred not only for faster speeds and lower fees but also for \"sovereignty\": enterprises can directly control the Layer2's development and avoid disruptions from other Layer1 applications (e.g., Layer1 performance degradation or short-term gas fee surges caused by a popular application). Additionally, Layer2s enable the development of broader application ecosystems (not just single applications) and capture value from these applications. This explains why Robinhood plans to launch a Layer2 and Stripe is developing a Layer1 – sovereign application chains will be a potential future trend, and Solana's Layer2 Stack can fully enable this narrative.\n\n\n\nMoreover, Solana's Layer2 can support both SVM and EVM, with potential liquidity interoperability between the two. This will attract projects that require EVM-compatibility but demand lower fees and higher performance – potentially making the migration of Ethereum ecosystems to Solana a new trend. (Solana's growth potential should revolve around the SOL token and its overall network, not exclusively around SVM.)\n\n\n\nWith an official Layer2 Stack, more application scenarios can be migrated to Layer2: for example, a dedicated chain for Solana's DePIN projects or a specialized chain for payment scenarios – reducing the mainnet's load. Expanding further, Solana could also develop an official bridge to connect these Layer2s; the revenue from this bridge could be reinvested to enhance SOL's value.\n\n\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Layer2 may reduce value capture from fees in the short term. Thus, the highest priority in the early stages should be completing the official permissioned chain (via Layer2 Stack) to launch a Solana-based HyperLiquid equivalent.\n\n# Summary\n\nThese strategies are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. They will:\n\n\n\n* Introduce new types of applications to enrich Solana's ecosystem;\n* Provide diverse value capture mechanisms for SOL, ensuring it correctly captures value from the ecosystem;\n* Lay a solid foundation for the effective implementation of the ICM strategy (ICM requires a low-inflation environment to encourage the development of new ICM-aligned applications, and a stable ecosystem will attract more traditional capital to participate in Solana);\n* Prepare Solana for future competition, as an increasing number of chains are leveraging exchanges (CEX/DEX/PERP) for empowerment.\n\n\n\nNote: The strategic insights presented in this article reflect the author's current views. If given the opportunity to communicate in depth and gain a better understanding of Solana's future plans, the author is capable of developing more aligned strategies, facilitating their implementation, and validating the author's vision for Web3 development.\n\n\n\n# AfterWord\n\nRecently, the BNBChain ecosystem has seen a surge in momentum, and ecosystem activity has experienced a resurgence. While many may view this recent upswing of BNB as merely a short-lived boom, the actual situation is that the industry will develop along two paths:\n\n1. The first path involves the continuous emergence of new hot topics that drive market sentiment, leading to numerous pump-and-dump activities. However, this path will undoubtedly present opportunities for substantial gains, attracting capital, users, and development teams to explore more efficient products and tools around it.\n2. The second path focuses on more fundamental inherent needs that better drive industry development, such as directions like RWA (Real-World Assets), AI (Artificial Intelligence), and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks).\n\nFor public chains, DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges), and CEXs (Centralized Exchanges), the optimal approach is to actively embrace both paths. Therefore, Solana can, to a certain extent, draw lessons from BNBChain’s experience in the first path while exploring the second path based on its own unique advantages.\n\nThis article represents some reflections on the second path. Of course, the strategy mentioned in this article is only the first step; once this first step is truly taken, there will be a second-phase strategy. I hope to have the opportunity to share more about it in the future.\n\n\n\n# Answers to Some Questions\n\n**Q: Is this approach too centralized?**\n\nA: For a public chain, technology can be decentralized, but operationally, a central guiding force is needed to steer its development. Otherwise, it may well be eliminated in the fierce competition. Therefore, a certain degree of centralized operation is acceptable.\n\n**Q: Regarding the revised data mentioned in the article, are there more appropriate data points available?**\n\nA: The data is definitely not final and requires further discussion, but the overall operational logic is relatively certain. The development pattern of the industry will most likely make public chains, DEXs, and CEXs competitors to one another. Hence, it is necessary to make preparations and plans early.\n\n**Q: The article mentions many applications, such as stablecoin protocols, for which there are already existing projects. Why is there still a need for the official team to develop one?**\n\nA: SOL-based stablecoin protocols will be among the most important DeFi financial infrastructures and are closely tied to SOL. They need to be overseen by the official team. Because if it were a third-party protocol, the development of that protocol would be aimed at its own growth and would not prioritize the impact on SOL. In contrast, if developed by the official team, the economic flows within it can drive capital repurchases and redistribution for SOL.\n\n",
