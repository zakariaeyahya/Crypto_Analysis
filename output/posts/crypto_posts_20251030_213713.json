    "selftext": "Hey [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/)\n\nWe’re the team behind [Teller](http://app.teller.org/), a lending protocol on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Hyper, and Katana.\n\nWe’ll be around for the next 3 days to answer questions about how our platform works, how we’ve structured our rewards program, what risks are involved, and how you can start earning 22% compounding yield on all your favorite tokens.\n\n**What is Teller?**\n\nWe’re a group of DeFi builders passionate about making yield simple and accessible for long-tail assets (tokens that don’t always get mainstream coverage). Our goal is to allow users to supply single tokens and earn more of the *same* token with no dual-asset pairs, no impermanent loss, and no lockups.\n\nFor example, you supply $MOON, you earn more $MOON automatically -- Simple. No gimmicks.\n\n**How does Teller work?**\n\n* We initially launched our [rewards program on Base](https://blog.teller.org/earn-compounding-yield-on-base-tokens-with-teller/) and have now expanded it to other networks: you can supply and stake your favorite tokens on Teller to earn up to **22% APY** per block.\n* No lock-ups. You can withdraw anytime.\n* No impermanent loss, because the protocol doesn’t use AMM style liquidity pools for lending. Instead: peer-to-pool lending. Borrowers draw from a pool; lenders deposit; borrowers repay interest.\n* As borrowing demand rises, the APY can go higher (ranging from 20-60%) because yield comes from borrower interest payments + our incentive program.\n* Once liquidity in a pool hits $100K, expect the incentive portion to gradually decline, with the organic borrowing interest taking over more of the yield burden.\n\n**What are the benefits?**\n\n* For token holders: you can hold a token you believe in, deposit it, and earn more of that same token, rather than converting into something else and dealing with pairs or LP tokens.\n* For risk control: because you're supplying single assets and there's no AMM, you avoid impermanent loss (which happens when you provide LP tokens and the relative price of the assets changes).\n* Transparent incentives: We’ve laid out how the yield is constructed (incentive side + borrower interest side) so users can understand what they’re participating in.\n\n**What are the risks?**\n\n* Lending always has default risk — borrowers might not repay. The protocol isolates pools by token to reduce cross-token risk. If a borrower does default then the collateral is put up on an onchain dutch auction, sold, and then returned to the pool.\n* Liquidity risk: While the protocol allows withdrawal anytime, if a large part of the liquidity is borrowed, there could be constraints (or interest rates might go up).\n* Token risk: Because you’re holding a token, you’re exposed to price volatility of that asset (even though there's no impermanent loss).\n* There is always contract risk, as with any protocol. However, Teller is 3 years old, has been audited 3 times, and uses Hypernative to protect against reentrancy attacks.\n\n**Holding $MOON?**\n\nThere is currently over 1% of the $MOON supply staked on Teller!\n\nYou can now supply and stake your MOONs to start earning more MOONs.\n\nSee the image below for an example of how much you can earn:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/np0gxios1byf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d7e011c5d2c53fa1cfe75092234286e251eeec0\n\n\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/ama-teller-launches-rewards-program-earn-22-compounding-v0-j7ktwmji0byf1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=7003ebfd53a6d4a4ecbc485c1c2d0543c5525db6)\n\n**How you can start earning:**\n\nStep 1: Go to [app.teller.org](https://t.co/Qi6U79QY9X)\n\nStep 2: Connect your wallet \n\nStep 3: Select your network\n\nStep 4: Select a lending pool \n\nStep 5: Supply + Stake your tokens and start earning 22% yield\n\n\n\n**Ask us anything!**",

Polygon continues to be the go-to stack for global money movement, with high reliability and low-fees.\n\nFlutterwave will begin a phased rollout on Polygon in 2025, starting with enterprise customers through Flutterwave for Business, followed by consumer remittance flows on Send App in 2026. \n\nThe goal: enable instant, affordable, stablecoin-powered payments for businesses and individuals across 30+ African countries.\n\nCross-border payments in emerging markets remain notoriously inefficient. \n\nFor businesses across Africa, settlement can take days and fees often exceed 8% of the transaction value, among the highest in the world.\n\nThe Polygon Labs x Flutterwave collab directly addresses these pain points. \n\nBy integrating Polygon’s high-performance blockchain infrastructure, Flutterwave can deliver instant settlement, low-cost transfers, and transparent flows for both corporations and consumers.\n\nThe first rollout focuses on enterprise clients and multinationals like Uber and Audiomack, enabling them to move money faster and more efficiently across borders. \n\nSubsequent phases will bring the same speed and affordability to millions of individuals using Flutterwave’s Send App, driving down remittance costs and increasing accessibility.\n\nThe collaboration offers a blueprint for stablecoin adoption in real-world economies. \n\nTraditional banking infrastructure in many emerging markets struggles to keep up with the pace of digital commerce. By building on Polygon’s sub-$.01 transaction fees and near-instant settlement, Flutterwave can bring financial access to regions where reliability and affordability are often in tension.\n\nPolygon already leads in emerging markets. While Wall Street warms to stablecoins, everyday users in emerging markets are driving adoption. Rising fees on competitor networks have pushed users toward lower-cost alternatives. Small USDC transfers on Polygon surged 141 % in 2025, with Argentina and Brazil accounting for a large share of that growth. \n\nFor people facing currency volatility or remittance bottlenecks, sending a stablecoin on Polygon costs fractions of a cent and confirms instantly\n\nThe Flutterwave venture comes as Polygon cements its position as the go-to stack powering global payments, moving billions in assets, instantly.\n\nRecent milestones include:\n\n* Processing half of all US USDC transfers in the $100–$1,000 range.\n* Powering BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund tokenization through Securitize, which now exceeds $1 billion AUM.\n* Supporting mainstream applications like Polymarket, which has surpassed $1.1 billion in volume and recently received a $2 billion investment from ICE.\n\nBy integrating Flutterwave’s scale with Polygon’s trusted rails, cross-border payments can be redefined: instant and low-cost.\n\nThe collaboration brings stablecoins from crypto exchanges to everyday commerce, from powering Uber driver payouts to enabling small merchants in Lagos, Nairobi, or Johannesburg to receive payments in seconds.\n\nIt’s a major leap forward in how blockchain can solve real-world payment challenges at scale, setting a new standard for financial inclusion and interoperability in the digital age.",

    "selftext": "This post is in direct counter to all of the non-believers in the other post asking if VET is dead. And yes, I am a bag holder. I bought 2017, sold 2021 and bought again 2023. But I am still in because I want to retire from crypto and the underdogs are the only way I can. And let's be honest, the price is all anyone cares about, I'm not gonna talk about GitHub development or sponsorships. I'll talk about facts and what is known.\n\nSo why is VET not dead? Why is it still not in sub 100 like Neo, Eos, IOTA, Tezos, Nano etc. One word. Endurance. The VET foundation is incredibly good at keeping the coin above water, almost 10 years now. Look at peak 2021. VET had nothing but words of partnerships, no different than Tezos. DNV, PWC, whatever. It did x100 from the 2020 lows. Look at what happened Dec last year. rank 50 to 30 in a couple of weeks and it wasn't even a proper rally. At that point the general sentiment around VET was horrible, and it still climbed to top 30.\n\nAre its usecases shit? Yes. Are we in a casino? Also yes. People are going to be looking for the juiciest potential in the upcoming alt season. And it ain't gonna be ETH or Solana. It's gonna be the underdog which pumped x100 in the span of months. The ones which have just about enough usecases to not call them memecoins, but not enough to already be top 5. The one which seemigly has all the right things going for it, but \"for some reason\" is still low in price. \n\nThis post is not meant to be a shill or anything, I already know this sub's sentiment towards the coin. It was just something I wanted to say.",

Ended up finding a wallet.dat dated 08/09/2011 which got me pretty excited. I also had Bitcoin Core installed. I sort of remember watching ads or doing captchas a back in these days since I was too young to have a job but always wanted to make money online.\n\nAnyway, I took the wallet.dat file and downloaded Bitcoin Core on my current PC. It was \"synchronizing the network\" and was about 13 years behind. I followed some tutorial to read my wallet in Bitcoin Core without waiting for the network to sync. It read that there is 0 BTC. Right now on Bitcoin Core if I go to \"File > Open Wallet\" It just gives me a greyed out text that says \"Default Wallet\" so I'm guessing when I redownloaded on my new PC it made a blank wallet. I believe the tutorial I followed involved replacing the wallet.dat in the BTC Core directory with the one I found from 2011. (Don't worry, I made like 3 back up wallet.dat's and still have my OG hard drive!)\n\nIs there another way I can go about double checking this? I just had the thought today that maybe I should let Bitcoin Core sync all blocks before trying to read the wallet.\n\nI won't be answering any DM's regarding the topic so save your effort, thanks!\n\n  \nEDIT: Also wanted to add there are numerous other files I found such as \\_db files, addr.dat, blk0001.dat, blkindex.dat, etc. I just pulled them all off my old hard drive as they were in the same area as wallet.dat",

But after understanding **Bitcoin**, everything changed.\n\n>\n\nTo him, Bitcoin represents a **revolution of loyalty**.  \nNo longer loyalty to people, parties, or governments — but **loyalty to the immutable principles of freedom and truth**.\n\nBitcoin doesn’t promise, doesn’t preach, doesn’t punish. It simply **works — fairly, for everyone**.\n\n>\n\nFrom believing in institutions, he turned to believing in **open source and personal sovereignty**.  \nNo more blind obedience — only understanding and conscious choice.\n\n💬 *“Loyalty used to be a virtue; now it’s a burden. In the world of Bitcoin, we don’t need loyalty — we need honesty.”*\n\n**#Bitcoin #FreedomMoney #Decentralization #PersonalSovereignty #BitcoinNative**\n\nRead more at: [https://primal.net/e/nevent1qqszyxeu3vz0szt45a8l8a29knf00e4504l90dmk0ls2dzknt5ty6ngev0hec](https://primal.net/e/nevent1qqszyxeu3vz0szt45a8l8a29knf00e4504l90dmk0ls2dzknt5ty6ngev0hec)",

It pauses the data stream upon disconnection and starts streaming again when you tell it to.  \n  \nYou won't miss updates from unstable gRPC connections anymore. Fumarole stores the last 23 hours; if you start using it today, you can stream yesterday's data, all the way up to the tip of the network!  \n  \nPlease read our blog post, which is linked in the following tweet!\n\n\n\n>You can read about Fumarole here: [https://blog.triton.one/introducing-yellowstone-fumarole/](https://blog.triton.one/introducing-yellowstone-fumarole/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/226g3diao9yf1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f8c7180f23102f3430d51118b82ccb8af903133\n\n",
