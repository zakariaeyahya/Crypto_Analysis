I was wondering how a cryptocurrency like WEN could perform on the short or long term ? 
Is it because WEN remains highly dependent  on cryptos like solana and ethereum? 
How can such a coin pump in the coming future ? The core idea of WEN seems very poetic but the long term success of such a coin remains difficult to understand for me. Am I missing something or a principle of this cryptocurrency ? Do you know any other coins that work on the same principle ? Thanks for your kind help !

cryptocurrency,1okyp7d,100 top crypto influencers enter trading competition - only 19 in profit,002_timmy,2025-10-31T17:08:22,8,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1okyp7d/100_top_crypto_influencers_enter_trading/,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1okyp7d/100_top_crypto_influencers_enter_trading/,"Synthetix Exchange is currently running a trading competition among 100 top crypto influencers. Each influencer was given $50,000 to trade on the platform.

As of now:

* Only 19 of the 100 traders have a positive PnL (meaning their account balance is above $50,000).
* 7 participants have made no trades at all, placing them between ranks 20–26 by default.
* 32 traders have lost 99% or more of their starting balance, meaning their accounts now hold less than $500.

This is a perpetual futures DEX, meaning traders can go long or short. Since it's a perp-dex, their performance isn’t tied to simple market direction because they can profit whether prices go up (long) or down (short) if they predict correctly. Despite that flexibility, the majority are losing heavily.

It’s a reminder that most influencers don’t make their money through trading. Their income often comes from deal flow, sponsorships, or promoting the platforms they appear to be using successfully. Many are subsidized or incentivized to generate high volume, creating the illusion of skill or profitability.

If they do make money trading, it's frequently by buying small cap coins early and shilling it later. These small caps are rarely put on perp dexes so they don't have this advantage.

Events like this pull back the curtain. Even with a fair playing field and access to the same tools as everyone else, very few of the so-called “top traders” can actually trade profitably.

But the market structure today looks *nothing* like it did in 2018 or even 2022, and one of the biggest reasons is the rise of crypto-backed lending.

In past cycles, when holders needed cash or wanted to de-risk, their only real option was to sell BTC. That constant spot selling created the brutal downward spirals we remember. Now, those same holders can borrow against their BTC instead. Platforms like Coinbase (using Morpho), Ledn, and even major banks like JPMorgan are offering ways to post Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs (like IBIT) as collateral for loans.

That’s a huge structural shift. Instead of dumping BTC to raise dollars, people can take out USD or stablecoin loans while keeping their exposure. On the institutional side, prime brokers and banks can now lend against spot-BTC ETFs inside normal margin systems — meaning corporate treasuries, family offices, and funds can unlock liquidity without touching spot markets.

The more liquidity that’s available through collateralized lending, the less forced selling pressure there is when prices dip. It doesn’t mean BTC can’t fall — liquidations and over-leverage can still trigger volatility — but it *does* mean fewer long-term holders are forced to sell at the bottom.

Add to that the maturing DeFi lending markets and new, regulated credit lines using crypto collateral, and you’ve got a system that can absorb shocks better than before.

The old four-year cycle assumed every downturn triggered mass selling. Now, with credit markets built around BTC itself, the next “crypto winter” might look more like a cool breeze than a deep freeze.",ANALYSIS,True,,False

Overrated (IMO):

* CoinMarketCap alerts - spams you with noise, most alerts are useless
* Most portfolio trackers - bloated UI, half the features I never touch
* Discord alpha groups - 90% recycled CT screenshots, 10% actual alpha

Underrated / actually useful:

For multi-chain trading: Banana Pro - started as a Telegram sniper bot, evolved into a clean web platform for DCA and limit orders on ETH/Solana. Non-custodial, fast execution, minimal gas optimization. Not flashy, just works.

For on-chain research: DeBank for wallet tracking, but honestly just raw Etherscan/Solscan for deep dives. No tool beats reading contracts directly.

For gas optimization: Blocknative gas estimator (ETH) - way more accurate than MetaMask's default estimates.

For security: Revoke cash - everyone should check their token approvals quarterly. So many hacks from old approvals.

The gap nobody's filled yet: A tool that aggregates Telegram/Discord alpha, filters signal from noise, and presents it clearly. Everything out there is either too manual or misses context.

They allegedly use wash trading with bots to fake volume, attracting traders and pumping prices artificially. The US CFTC fined them $4.3 billion in 2023 for this.

Leverage allows big bets, but small drops trigger liquidations, where Binance sells positions and takes fees. They supposedly trigger these to cause chain reactions, as in October 2025 events wiping out billions.

Grid bots buy low and sell high automatically. Small trades can exploit weaknesses, rippling to larger markets. Binance's algorithms counter this, causing volatility.

They time trades and news to exploit fear (panic selling) and greed (chasing pumps). Flash crashes liquidate positions, allowing cheap buys and subsequent pumps.

Partners like Wintermute and Tether form a cartel: Tether props prices, Wintermute floods orders, Binance lists shady coins for fees.

This turns crypto into a casino. Strokin warns of a potential Bitcoin crash affecting markets. Binance denies claims, citing market forces, but faces ongoing fines. Advice: use stop-losses, avoid high leverage, stick to major coins.

Michail Strokin (@mstrokin), a self-described ""crazy hacker and paradigm shifter,"" frequently posts about Bitcoin and crypto markets on X. He claims to have ""broken"" Bitcoin through hacks and demos, accusing Binance of heavy market manipulation.

Strokin asserts that Binance can crash Bitcoin's price to $30K–$50K with just three clicks, impacting the US stock market due to its ties to Bitcoin. He suggests a conspiracy involving China to weaken the US.

He demonstrates using Binance's grid bots with small amounts like $5,000 to spike trading volume, causing price swings in small coins like Trumpcoin that affect major ones like Bitcoin, Solana, and Ethereum, as seen in early March 2024.

On Bybit, he set up a 20x leveraged grid bot leading to a Bitcoin crash, liquidating 133,000 traders and $413 million. He blames Binance and partners like Wintermute for enabling this, funneling money to scammy big players.

Strokin says Binance exploits traders' fear and greed. His bots succeed without stop-loss or take-profit, going all-in.

He shares videos of ""hacks,"" like shorting Bitcoin to $95K then longing back to $100K with minimal funds. He urges Binance to stop manipulating prices.",DEBATE,True,,False

Then I was told I needed to send **more BNB/ETH** to “reverse” the transaction — every time I tried, it asked for even more gas. It feels like an exponential trap.

Now my BNB/ETH is gone and the USDT.Z tokens are worthless — no liquidity on PancakeSwap and no way to swap or sell. The address the scammer sent funds to is **0xda4faab399ffdd9f68b83110930a59740d0a9312.**

Nowadays, it’s pretty much impossible to launch a meme coin or project without having snipers, whales, or even insider destroy the early momentum. Don’t let me get started with what bundle transactions are doing to some token launches. 

Go on pumpdotfun or other trading terminals and see for yourself, first everything looks good, then the next second everything is read (indicators of how much is owned by whom). You see snipers and bundle initially have close to 0% then suddenly everything dumps and the numbers go above 30%. 

I personally think that these indicators are completely unreliable and garbage. What we actually need is a Launchpad that protects traders and investors from the very beginning by preventing bots, whales, and insiders from dominating and manipulating the early stage of a bonding curve until migration. 

I am tired of seeing project being launched and getting rugged 3 minutes later. I have begun working on a solution to reduce the risk of rugs during the early moments of the bonding curve until migration.

I’m not selling, but disclosure: I personally moved \~20% to stables in October since I’m unemployed (laid off) and need a safety net.

This (attached) [$BTC](https://x.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=cashtag_click) chart still gives me pause. My old hand-drawn log trend clearly shows the major resistance over the past year. That said, since this is a wholly unprecedented and likely extended cycle, historic trends aren't gospel. Assuming an extended cycle:

**Potential short-term Bearish scenario:**  
A .236 fib (\~$77k) retest fits mid-bull behavior. Below that, we’re probably in a bear. I don’t think we drop that far yet, but there’s heavy uncertainty and I can't rule it out.

**Less bearish (bullish) case (I'm leaning towards this):**  
We had momentum before 10/10’s liquidation. It will take time to recover, but downside doesn't have to be as deep as the .236. In that case, more bullish support levels include: $107k, $100k–$102k, $93k, $81k.

**What to watch:**  
\~Trump easing tariff pressure (mostly China)  
\~AI/equities maintaining bullish momentum  
\~Continued Fed easing

If those happen, we likely see a massive rally, including top alts, on the back of lower rates, QE, and the everything bubble. If not, and BTC breaks below .236, expect $50k–$60k BTC range as the new floor, and alts following it down.

**What about Ethereum?**  
I’m heavier in [$ETH](https://x.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=cashtag_click), expecting rotation. Economic uncertainty (tariffs, shutdown) is delaying risk-on flows, but that changes if conditions improve and the Fed truly eases. Powell’s downplaying it, but I think they will continue cutting too.

Watch BTC dominance- it’s still trending down despite a bounce after 10/10. It needs to continue dropping while not absolutely tanking the larger crypto market. With Tom Lee and other Ether advocates pushing the narrative and major Ethereum updates ahead in a post regulatory climate, it’s still my favorite alt for the risk-on rotation.

Ether's log trend suggests a top around $7k–$8k in a bullish continuation, and much higher long term.

In a bear, downside likely starts at $3300, then $2100, with worst case around $1500. Institutional holders will cushion the fall, but some will still fold. And in a bearish scenario where the equity bubble pops, we get some times (months, year) of risk off) but expect a very strong bounce off the floor from ETH as profits from equities flow into Ether, now at a much spicier entry and multiple institutions heavy bidding it.",ANALYSIS,False,,False

Welcome to our second major CCMOON DAO update. The past few weeks have been full of major progress across governance, treasury, partnerships, and real-world DAO formation efforts. What began as a decentralized subreddit project is now moving closer than ever to becoming a legally recognized organization with active DeFi integrations and expanding sources of revenue.

The most exciting development is that the DAO is now on the verge of becoming an officially recognized legal entity through MIDAO, based in the Marshall Islands. After a meeting with MIDAO representatives, we were offered a discounted rate of $6,100 through 2026 (normally $12,500) to register as a non-profit DAO LLC. This will give CCMOON DAO legal standing, limited liability protections, and greater legitimacy in future partnerships. A proposal is live now on r/CryptoCurrencyMeta, and the vote is scheduled for Moon Week 68.

Another major milestone is the Teller integration on Arbitrum One. Moons are now live on Teller, a decentralized lending protocol, offering 22% APY paid directly in Moons. Teller is funding this program from its own treasury by making market purchases of Moons to pay rewards. Within the first 48 hours, more than 1.5 million Moons—over $100,000 worth—were deposited. This is a massive leap forward for Moon utility and onchain participation.

We have also filled another key DAO Officer role, adding a Technology & Infrastructure Officer. The current officer roster and open positions are listed below. The Community Engagement Officer and Ecosystem Growth Officer positions remain open, and the usual 50,000 Moon holding requirement has been removed so more members can participate. If you’d like to nominate yourself, you can do so on r/CryptoCurrencyMeta.

Over the last 2.5 weeks, the DAO received about $5,000 in new revenue from Katana, SurfAI, Vultisig, BONKfun, and Polygon. This continues our growing stream of recurring payments that support burns, distributions, treasury, and DAO-owned liquidity.

Let’s take a look at where everything stands as of October 30.

# 1. General Overview and Useful Links

Moons on Arbitrum One are now being used more actively than ever before. With lending, trading, and DAO-owned liquidity positions all growing, Arbitrum One has become the center of onchain activity for Moon holders. Nearly half of all non-burned Moons are now productive in DeFi pools or DAO-managed liquidity, showing that the ecosystem is thriving with engaged users, integrations, and real usage.

# 2. Treasury Overview

As of October 30, 2025, the DAO Treasury holds approximately $71,370 in total value.  
The last update on October 13 reported a treasury value of $76,865. While total value has decreased by roughly $5,495, the non-Moon portion of the treasury has increased by about $610, and the stablecoin portion (USDC, USDT, USDC.E) has increased by approximately $1,224. This reflects real growth in liquid assets despite the price decline in Moons.

Treasury Holdings:

|Asset|Balance|Value (USD)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Moons|848,192|$62,618|
|ETH|0.83683|$3,105|
|USDC|3,337|$3,337|
|USDT|1,301|$1,301|
|ARB|1,848|$521|
|USDC.E (bridged)|487|$487|

Non-Moon value: approximately $8,750  
Change since last update: +$610 non-Moon value (+$1,224 in stablecoins)

# 3. Burn Summary

Total and change since October 13 update -

Arbitrum One: 1,037,977 Moons burned (+16,616)  
Arbitrum Nova: 3,132,254 Moons burned (+10)  
Total burned: 4,170,231 Moons (+16,626)

These burns continue to demonstrate healthy advertising and partner activity across the DAO’s integrated platforms.

# 4. DAO-Owned Liquidity (DOL)

DAO-Owned Liquidity is held in the USDC–MOON pool on Uniswap.

Uniswap Pool: [https://app.uniswap.org/positions/v3/arbitrum/5028650](https://app.uniswap.org/positions/v3/arbitrum/5028650)  
Wallet for tracking: 0x33D549e99bae2Ff38cA1AdB280f77151C86E1b3c

Current position value: $3,791  
Composition: 29,210 Moons and 1,615 USDC

Fees earned since the last update: $21.13  
Moon size since Oct 13: +6880 MOON   
USDC size since Oct 13: +733 USDC  
Total DOL growth since last report: +$964 in total value

The DAO moved from a v4 to v3 Uniswap pool to ensure integration compatibility with Teller. This pool is now the reference pricing source for many DeFi applications on Arbitrum and will continue to earn fees and reinvest them.

# 5. Distribution Updates

Distributions continue to follow the new 12-month revenue-based model approved in the previous update. Assuming no additional burns, approximately 4,000 Moons will be distributed each period.

The app used to claim Moons and poll rewards is currently offline due to AWS and Microsoft outages. The technical team is working with service providers to restore functionality and evaluating redundancies to prevent similar downtime in the future.

We are also exploring additional sponsorship-based distributions similar to the previous Polygon campaign that contributed $5,000 in POL tokens for subreddit users.

# 6. Sponsorships and Partnerships

Revenue received since October 13 totals approximately $5,000, with payments from Katana, SurfAI, Vultisig, [Bonk.fun](http://Bonk.fun), and Polygon. These funds were allocated across burns, distributions, treasury, and DAO-owned liquidity per the standard 25/25/25/25 split.

Upcoming and active AMAs include Teller (live now), SurfAI, [Bonk.fun](http://Bonk.fun), Pineapple, Trezor, and multiple Monad announcement posts and AMAs.

# 7. Moons on Arbitrum One

Max total supply: 9,668,157 MOON

Holder distribution:  
Camelot v3 pool – 1.8M (18.75%)  
Teller supply – \~1.5M (15.23%)  
Burn address – 1.04M (10.74%)  
DAO multisig treasury – 848K (8.77%)

Over one-third of the total supply is now actively productive in DeFi pools, burned, or held in the treasury.  
Excluding the burned supply, that rises to around 40%.  
If the DAO multisig is also excluded, nearly 45% of all circulating Moons on Arbitrum on are now engaged in active DeFi use cases.

# 8. Governance and Upcoming Proposals

Two proposals are currently live on r/CryptoCurrencyMeta:

1. Formalizing CCMOON DAO as a legal Marshall Islands non-profit DAO LLC through MIDAO.
2. Authorizing DAO officers to negotiate advertising partnerships with protocols, projects, or personalities to support Moon utility and development. 

Both proposals are scheduled for a Moon Week 68 vote.

# 9. Bridge Development

The DAO is exploring new bridging solutions to improve movement of Moons between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One. Current bridging options are limited and slow—most notably, the canonical Arbitrum bridge requires a six-and-a-half-day transfer period. We are reaching out to third-party bridge teams to create a faster and more user-friendly path between networks.

Users are encouraged to move Moons to Arbitrum One if they wish to participate in integrations like Teller and future DeFi partnerships, as Arbitrum One currently has broader ecosystem support.

# 10. Future Plans

The DAO’s number one goal remains to complete legal registration as a Marshall Islands DAO LLC. This will formalize our status, protect contributors, and allow direct contracting with partners and advertisers.

Other active initiatives include:  
• Expanding DeFi utility for Moons via Teller and Uniswap integrations  
• Pursuing grants to fund a DEX integration on [ccmoons.com](http://ccmoons.com)  
• Building a faster cross-chain bridge for Nova to One liquidity  
• Hosting recurring AMAs and live update streams to reach broader audiences beyond Reddit

That concludes the CCMOON DAO update for October 30, 2025. The next update will come after Moon Week 68. ",DEVELOPMENT,True,,False

But the market structure today looks *nothing* like it did in 2018 or even 2022, and one of the biggest reasons is the rise of crypto-backed lending.

In past cycles, when holders needed cash or wanted to de-risk, their only real option was to sell BTC. That constant spot selling created the brutal downward spirals we remember. Now, those same holders can borrow against their BTC instead. Platforms like Coinbase (using Morpho), Ledn, and even major banks like JPMorgan are offering ways to post Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs (like IBIT) as collateral for loans.

That’s a huge structural shift. Instead of dumping BTC to raise dollars, people can take out USD or stablecoin loans while keeping their exposure. On the institutional side, prime brokers and banks can now lend against spot-BTC ETFs inside normal margin systems — meaning corporate treasuries, family offices, and funds can unlock liquidity without touching spot markets.

The more liquidity that’s available through collateralized lending, the less forced selling pressure there is when prices dip. It doesn’t mean BTC can’t fall — liquidations and over-leverage can still trigger volatility — but it *does* mean fewer long-term holders are forced to sell at the bottom.

Add to that the maturing DeFi lending markets and new, regulated credit lines using crypto collateral, and you’ve got a system that can absorb shocks better than before.

The old four-year cycle assumed every downturn triggered mass selling. Now, with credit markets built around BTC itself, the next “crypto winter” might look more like a cool breeze than a deep freeze.",,True,,False

You earn it, hold it, and spend it — no questions asked. It was simple, private, and immediate. But somewhere along the way, cash started feeling inconvenient. Shops moved to cards, banks added rules, and paying someone online became a maze of logins, fees, and waiting periods.

The moment I realized cash was outdated wasn’t dramatic. It happened on a dusty roadside in a mountain town. My scooter had a flat tire, and the repairman, an older guy with grease-stained hands asked, “Do you have Bitcoin?” I laughed. “No signal here, but I can pay cash.” He smiled, pointed at a small sign beside his tool kit, and said, “Lightning works faster.” Out of curiosity, I opened my wallet app and scanned his QR through [Akasha](https://akashapay.com/). The payment went through instantly, no network bars, no card reader, no problem.

That moment hit me. Cash wasn’t freedom anymore, this was.

Bitcoin through Lightning isn’t about replacing tradition. It’s about restoring the freedom cash once gave us, but in a world that runs on connectivity. Here’s what makes it powerful:

· Instant payments; no waiting, no verification lines.

· Borderless reach; anyone, anywhere, same rules.

· No middlemen: no “transaction denied” screens.

· Real privacy: your data stays yours.

It’s funny how something digital can feel more real than paper.

A few weeks later, I started noticing how many small shops were listed on Akasha’s map, roadside tea stalls, tailors, even mechanics. People who don’t talk about Bitcoin online but quietly use it to make life easier. These are not investors. They are everyday people who like money that simply work. And when you see it in person, not on Twitter or news sites, it clicks. Bitcoin is not a future dream. It is already here, hiding in easy reach. When I tell people what happened, they often question if the repairman was familiar about Bitcoin. He didn’t. He just knew it worked.

That’s the beauty of it. Real adoption doesn’t need perfect understanding, just trust in a better experience.

but the universe looked me dead in the eye and said “nah bro, you’re gonna watch this thing moon forever.”

that’s it. that’s the logic. not supply and demand, not S2F, not macro trends! 

just pure universal spite. bitcoin’s one and only mission is to make *me personally* feel bad.  
so if you see it going up, remember: it’s not because of ETFs or adoption or halving.. it’s because the universe hates me and wants to rub it in.

BTC price movements have shown intriguing correlations with the FED's quantitative tightening (QT) cycles, where the Fed reduces its balance sheet by allowing securities to mature without reinvestment, effectively draining liquidity from the financial system. In traditional markets, QT tightens credit conditions, often leading to higher bond yields and stock market corrections, as seen in the 2018 equity sell-off amid rising rates and liquidity withdrawal. Conversely, ending QT halts this drainage, stabilizing reserves and acting as a subtle form of easing, which can buoy risk assets like crypto by reducing funding pressures.

Historically, the first QT began in October 2017, followed by Btc's cycle peak at around $20k in December 2017, about two months later, as liquidity tightened. QT ended in August 2019, shortly after BTC's local top near $14k in June 2019. However, BTC dipped 35% post QT end before the 2020 COVID quantitative easing (QE) ignited a massive bull run, flooding markets with liquidity and propelling BTC to new highs.

This suggests ending QT doesn't immediately mark a cycle top but removes a key headwind, potentially signaling a new beginning for upward momentum, especially if paired with rate cuts or QE. The Fed's recent announcement to cease QT on December 1, 2025, amid ongoing rate reductions, aligns with this pattern. While short term dips occurred in 2019, the liquidity stabilization could foster a bullish environment for BTC, assuming no major shocks. Current sentiment on social media reflects sell the news reactions, but increasing BTC volumes hint at accumulation ahead. Overall, ending QT appears more as a catalyst for renewal than a top marker.

More liquidity in the market means more volatility. Risk based DCA is still the best strategy for this environment. As of right now, BTC at $109k corresponds to a risk of 46 out of 100. If it's still under 50 till Sunday, I will just DCA at my base pace.",,False,,False

There is something i don't understand.  
Coinglass says that there is 2M BTC on the exchanges while CryptoQuant shows less than 1M.

The year was 2008, and the world was in the midst of a global financial crisis. A mysterious programmer (or programmers) under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto released a nine-page document that would change the world forever, titled: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. This humble PDF, published on a cryptography mailing list, wasn't just theory: it was the recipe for a decentralized digital money system, resistant to corrupt banks and meddling governments.

You can read it in full right here, just as Satoshi shared it: [Bitcoin Whitepaper (PDF)](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). In its pages, it details how a peer-to-peer network, with chained blocks (what we now call blockchain) and a proof-of-work mechanism, could validate transactions without intermediaries and transfer value globally, instantly and securely.

It was the perfect antidote to the Lehman Brothers collapse, which had happened just a month earlier. Satoshi sent it to the Cryptography Mailing List on October 31, 2008, and it's now the seed of a revolution valued today in trillions of dollars. On January 3, 2009, just two months after the whitepaper, Satoshi mined the genesis block (Bitcoin's block zero). In its coinbase transaction, he didn't just include code: he etched an eternal message, taken from a headline in The Times that day: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."" It was a silent cry against the failed financial system, a reminder that Bitcoin was born to break the chains of bank bailouts. That block, with its initial 50 bitcoins, remains untouched on the blockchain, like a digital time capsule.

On Halloween, Bitcoin is that ""ghost"" haunting traditional bankers, disguised as harmless innovation. This crypto ""trick or treat"" has turned early adopters into millionaires, inspired thousands of altcoins, and even ETFs on Wall Street. While the world asks for candy this October 31, bitcoiners celebrate the sweet taste of financial sovereignty.

Now it’s not the time to get antsy, I personally can feel it myself as the temptation to jump into other coins or assets that are performing well are going higher.

Others are screaming it. I’ve compiled a list of totally legit evidence, proving the inevitable collapse. This based on nothing but the most rigorous,  anecdotal observations, but heed my words.

1. The price dropped 2% yesterday. That alone is enough evidence to declare market armageddon.

2. My neighbor who swore Bitcoin was a scam just asked how to buy it. Top is in.

3. Institutions are piling in as fast as possible. Nothing says market collapse like widespread adoption and record inflows.

4. This time is different.  It's not a bubble if it's called a ""paradigm shift""

5. Headlines keep screaming “Bitcoin is dead.” Journalists never exaggerate.

6. There’s less Bitcoin on exchanges than ever. Everyone’s hoarding it, which clearly means disaster ahead.

7. Mining difficulty went up. More miners? That’s obviously a sign of collapse.

8. I stepped away from the charts for 10 minutes. I’m usually glued to them, market crash imminent.

9. Global chaos continues. World leaders are still doing the things that make the financial system barely hold together, so clearly Bitcoin gave up too.

10. Bitcoin didn’t come up in a single Zoom call today. Clearly, the bull has abandoned the office (and our lives).

So there you have it. The market is definitely doomed, or atleast going into extreme hibernation. But hey, maybe tomorrow we’ll all be millionaires again.",,True,,False

I keep seeing people on X saying that quotes on Solana DEXes are better than on CEXes, but that doesn’t really seem accurate.

So I decided to challenge myself and see if this take is genuine or just another nonsense shill!

**1 - Binance gave me 458,715.5 For 30k USDT.**

The core conviction is that economic incentives must perfectly align with technical reliability.

1) Optimal Uptime Risk: Institutional funds use institutional validators with 99.9%+ uptime, minimizing investor risk. Validators face a trade-off: aiming for higher availability can expose them to harsher slashing penalties.

2) Fee Market Pressure: Fees represent validators' primary earnings source, covering infrastructure and operational costs. The fee model directly impacts profit margins and long-term viability, creating pressure to maximize performance while minimizing expensive hardware expenditure.

3) The ETF Tax Paradox: Solana ETFs structure yield to be reinvested and taxed only on capital gains, while staking rewards are currently taxed as income. This tax advantage for ETF holders indirectly pressures validators who are relying on staking rewards for revenue.

The system relies on strong validator economics. Does the ETF tax advantage weaken the incentive for decentralized validation, or does Solana’s low-fee model inherently breed more reliable validator uptime due to competitive pressure?",Ecosystem,True,,False

$2.5B in options expire today. If those options do not tank the price, can we expect to see $4k again in the coming days? Just because ETH interest has stalled does not mean it can't again be boosted with institutional support.

By labeling market makers as unregistered ""Dealers,"" the SEC is creating massive compliance risk, which could lead to a sudden liquidity cliff across the entire digital asset ecosystem.

1) Broker-Dealer Crackdown: The SEC is charging major firms with operating as unregistered broker-dealers for activities like executing trades and providing liquidity. Cumberland allegedly facilitated over $2 billion in transactions involving assets classified as securities.

2) Securities Classification Risk: The SEC specifically identifies widely traded assets, including Solana and Cosmos as having been offered as investment contracts/securities in violation of the Exchange Act.

3) DeFi Contagion: The new SEC rule defines ""Dealer"" so broadly that it could sweep in Automated Market Maker liquidity providers and other DeFi participants, raising concerns about applying broker-dealer rules to software protocols.

In traditional markets, QT tightens credit conditions, often leading to higher bond yields and stock market corrections, as seen in the 2018 equity sell-off amid rising rates and liquidity withdrawal. Conversely, ending QT halts this drainage, stabilizing reserves and acting as a subtle form of easing, which can buoy risk assets like crypto by reducing funding pressures.

Historically, the first QT began in October 2017, followed by Btc's cycle peak at around $20k in December 2017, about two months later, as liquidity tightened. QT ended in August 2019, shortly after BTC's local top near $14k in June 2019. However, BTC dipped 35% post QT end before the 2020 COVID quantitative easing (QE) ignited a massive bull run, flooding markets with liquidity and propelling BTC to new highs.

This suggests ending QT doesn't immediately mark a cycle top but removes a key headwind, potentially signaling a new beginning for upward momentum, especially if paired with rate cuts or QE. The Fed's recent announcement to cease QT on December 1, 2025, amid ongoing rate reductions, aligns with this pattern. While short term dips occurred in 2019, the liquidity stabilization could foster a bullish environment for BTC, assuming no major shocks. Current sentiment on social media reflects sell the news reactions, but increasing BTC volumes hint at accumulation ahead. Overall, ending QT appears more as a catalyst for renewal than a top marker.

More liquidity in the market means more volatility. Risk based DCA is still the best strategy for this environment. As of right now, BTC at $109k corresponds to a risk of 46 out of 100. If it's still under 50 till Sunday, I will just DCA at my base pace.",ANALYSIS,True,,False

except now i am reading more about US rules and it is starting tto scare the hell out of me 

they do not just want money when you win... they want the paper trail even when you lose... every year... every sale... every swap... even if the final number is a big red minus

so instead of “you are safe because you are down” it is actually “you still have to tell us how you lost it”

that was the comfortabel lie i told myself.

On the top ofthat…about 7 months ago i did something stupid... i ran a drainer and pulled around 60k... cashed it out... spent it on designer stuff and random expensive things like an idiot... and then just... moved on

except now i can’t sleep because that part is not a trading loss... that is straight up taxable income... and it is from something that was not legal... and you cannot hide that behind “but i was down overall on crypto” because trading losses do not cancel dirty income

so now i am here at 27 thinking... ok so the losing trades still have to be reported... and the 60k has to be reported... and i already spent it... and exchanges are reporting more stuff every year... and the irs literally asks “did you deal in digital assets” on the return

i am scared i waited too long

not asking anyone how to hide it... i kind of know the real answer already... talk to a tax attorney... tell them everything... fix the old years before the irs asks first

Here's what confuses me from a technical standpoint:

We have lightning-fast L2s. Cross-chain bridges work (mostly). DeFi protocols settle instantly. But getting stablecoins <-> fiat still requires:

* Centralized exchanges (custody risk)
* Multiple KYC processes (friction)
* T+3 settlement for fiat (archaic)
* 2-4% in combined fees (worse than credit cards)

The question: Is this a technical limitation or just regulatory/legacy banking bottleneck?

Because it seems like the crypto side is solved - USDC/USDT transfers are fast and cheap. The problem is the fiat rails, right? But then why hasn't someone built a proper liquidity protocol for fiat settlement?

I've seen platforms claiming instant settlements between stablecoins and traditional banking, but I can't figure out the technical architecture. Are they just using faster banking APIs? Running their own liquidity pools? Or is it still the same old ACH/SEPA with better UX?

What I'm really asking:

1. Is there a decentralized solution being developed for fiat on/off-ramps, or will this always require centralized entities with banking licenses?
2. Could something like a liquidity network (similar to Lightning) exist for fiat settlements?
3. Are there technical innovations in payment rails I'm missing, or is everyone just wrapping legacy systems in crypto-friendly interfaces?

From a pure tech perspective, it feels like we're one protocol away from solving this entirely. But maybe I'm being naive about regulatory constraints?

What caught my attention wasn’t the campaign itself but the idea behind it, it was done through Bitget’s GetAgent, an AI system that allows users to ask philosophical and technical questions about Bitcoin’s evolution. It made me think about how these AI frameworks could potentially become tools for crypto education or research, not just marketing.

From a technical standpoint, I find it fascinating how large language models might be trained on early Bitcoin forums, the whitepaper, and cypherpunk writings to reconstruct certain thought patterns or analyze how decentralization principles might evolve alongside AI-driven systems. There’s also the issue of bias, how do these models interpret the idea of “trustless” systems when they themselves rely on centralized infrastructure and curated data?

Would it even be meaningful or accurate for AI to try to “think like Satoshi”? Could this sort of simulation actually help us reflect on how far crypto has drifted from its cypherpunk roots or is it just another layer of abstraction?

This technical upgrade implements Polkadot's Minimal Relay vision through system chain enhancements and Asset Hub migration, delivering permanent scalability improvements, lower fees, and enhanced accessibility with proven execution from Kusama precedent.

**🔗 Full 19-Point Analysis:** [https://vonflandern.org/polkadot-referendum/1777](https://vonflandern.org/polkadot-referendum/1777)

# 📊 vonFlandern's Methodology Results:

|Category|Score|Assessment|Key Issue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Impact on Ecosystem**✅|83%|**AYE**|Frees validator resources for more coretime and lowers user barriers|
|**Governance Compliance**✅|97%|**AYE**|Appropriate WhitelistedCaller track with strong precedents|
|**Cost-Benefit Ratio**✅|93%|**AYE**|Zero treasury spend with high operational efficiency|
|**Transparency**✅|95%|**AYE**|Detailed timelines, metrics, and monitoring tools|
|**Credibility**✅|98%|**AYE**|Extensive track record of successful migrations and upgrades|

**→ Final Decision: AYE** (5x ✅ | 0x 🤷 | 0x ❌)

# 🎯 Key Analysis Points:

# ✅ Real Infrastructure Value Identified:

* **Architectural Optimization:** Implements RFC-32 Minimal Relay vision by migrating governance, staking, and balances to Asset Hub, freeing relay chain resources to provide more coretime and enhance scalability
* **Proven Precedent:** Successful Kusama migration on October 7, 2025, completed in 3 hours 13 minutes with 348,210 accounts and 17.13M KSM transferred without issues
* **User Economic Improvements:** Reduces existential deposit from 1 DOT to 0.01 DOT (100x lower), lowers transaction fees by 5-10x, and enables fee payments in any supported asset
* **Interoperability Enhancement:** Positions Asset Hub as central hub with Ethereum bridges and stablecoin support, simplifying developer integrations and supporting parachain growth

# ⚠️ Critical Concerns with Proposal:

* **Execution Dependency:** Requires precise coordination during 6-10 hour migration window, though mitigated by extensive testing and Kusama success
* **No Alternatives Considered Viable:** Status quo would maintain inefficiencies, but migration is the only path to RFC-32 benefits without perpetual opportunity costs

That is a valid but narrow path. At the same time, an alternative design – the **v.o.x framework** – was put forward to create a chain-agnostic, macro-aware valuation and transparency layer, not just “another stable”. That alternative did **not** receive the same visibility on Polkassembly. My Polkassembly accounts were restricted after raising the v.o.x framework. If our main governance gateway can quietly limit competing economic proposals, we have decentralisation in form, not in substance. This post asks the community to acknowledge the second design, to reopen the debate, and to make moderation rules explicit.

# 1. Why I am posting this

This post is to put on record that, in 2024–2025, there were **two** materially different directions for a Polkadot “monetary” / “value” layer:

1. **pUSD** – a DOT-backed, over-collateralised, Honzon-lineage stablecoin being advanced through current governance rails.
2. **v.o.x framework** – a broader, chain-agnostic value and transparency framework designed to compare activity across Polkadot, Ethereum and other networks, and to avoid single-asset fragility.

Only the first is being fully amplified through the official governance gateway.

# 2. What pUSD is

* **Design:** pUSD is a debt-minted, over-collateralised stablecoin. Users lock **DOT** and mint pUSD. They must maintain the required collateral ratio or face liquidation.
* **Lineage:** The approach is descended from the Acala / Honzon model (what previously powered aUSD), with promises of better controls this time.
* **Intent:** Give Polkadot a native unit so the ecosystem does not rely solely on USDT/USDC.
* **Reality:** It is still **single-asset (DOT) dependent**, and therefore imports DOT price and liquidity risk directly into the “stable”.

**Sources (public):**

* Polkadot governance discussions on pUSD (Polkassembly / OpenGov)
* Acala documentation on Honzon / aUSD design (for the earlier model)
* Asset Hub / system chains updates on stable assets

# 3. What the v.o.x framework proposed

The **v.o.x framework** was **not** a like-for-like competitor to pUSD. It was deliberately **wider**:

1. **Multi-chain from the start** – aim: compare and normalise value between Polkadot, Ethereum and other networks.
2. **Macro-aware** – aim: pull in on-chain activity (TVL movements, protocol growth, issuance, liquidity depth) and, where possible, external macro signals so the value standard is not purely reflexive.
3. **Multi-source / multi-collateral** – aim: avoid the “all risk in DOT” problem.
4. **Transparency portal (a v.o.x UI)** – aim: show *why* a value is assigned and *which* chains / sources contributed.
5. **DAO-directed parameters** – aim: the community chooses the data sources and eligible networks, not a single development team.

This part is **my work**. It is not a treasury-funded Polkadot deliverable, so there is no official Polkadot URL for you to point to. On internal drafts and architecture notes: **can’t say.**

# 4. The key differences

|Aspect|pUSD (current path)|v.o.x framework (proposed path)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Scope|One chain, one collateral (DOT), one output (USD-pegged unit)|Cross-chain, multi-input, valuation + transparency layer|
|Risk|Directly exposed to DOT price/liquidity and to the execution of one design family|Designed to spread and surface risk across sources|
|Control|Advanced through the existing, moderated, treasury-funded gateway (Polkassembly / OpenGov) by a small, known set of actors|Intended to let a DAO select data sources and networks, reducing the chance of single-team capture|
|Outcome|“Polkadot has a stablecoin.”|“Polkadot becomes a value-honest, multi-chain-aware hub.”|

# 5. On the “decentralised” part

Polkassembly describes itself as supporting decentralised, transparent and inclusive governance. That is the claim.

What I experienced was different:

* The main gateway is **ecosystem-funded**, so it is not completely neutral.
* Proposals from already-recognised teams are surfaced and socialised.
* A competing, broader economic design (the **v.o.x framework**) was **not** given the same runway.
* Moderation / account decisions were used in a way that effectively removed that design from the main forum.

That is why I am stating, plainly:

>

If a governance gateway can restrict a technically aligned but non-aligned proposal, we have to say so openly.

# 6. Personal note (read as testimony)

My Polkassembly accounts were blocked/restricted **after** I started presenting the **v.o.x framework** and pointing out that Polkadot was about to ship a *narrower* monetary primitive than was actually possible.

That is **my testimony**. Anyone who wishes to contest it should ask the Polkassembly administrators for their side. If there is a policy that allows that kind of restriction, it should be published.

# 7. What I am asking the community

1. **Acknowledge** that there was a second, more ambitious design (the v.o.x framework) beside pUSD.
2. **Require** equal procedural access on Polkassembly for non-treasury, community designs – especially when they expose structural gaps.
3. **Reopen** the economic discussion: do we want a single-asset, debt-style stablecoin, or do we want a macro-aware, chain-agnostic value layer?
4. **Publish** clear, public moderation and account-restriction rules so that governance forums cannot be quietly weaponised.

# 8. Why this matters

If we only ship pUSD, we will have **a** stablecoin, but we will not have **a value system**.

If we allow the main governance gateway to limit uncomfortable but constructive designs, then what we are calling “decentralised development” is really **centralised agenda-setting with a community UI on top**.

If Polkadot wants to attract serious, multi-chain capital, it needs the broader, transparent, metric-driven approach – not just a rebadged Acala-style stable.",,True,,False

The $HOTA team isn’t “hoping” for virality — they’re engineering it.

**Token Vision**

Hotako isn’t chasing hype. She’s building a brand narrative — the “first educational meme universe” powered by community creativity and storytelling.

With the Nyaruverse in development, $HOTA will evolve beyond memes — creating a lasting ecosystem of learning, gaming, and cultural engagement.

**Why $HOTA Could Hit 100x**

Strong narrative and visual identity  
Massive meme + anime crossover potential  
Smart, planned marketing rollout  
Community-first launch and tokenomics

In the meme cycle, the next 100x doesn’t come from hype alone — it comes from execution with emotional connection.

And Hotako has both.

I used to be that guy who just held through every dip waiting for a miracle, telling myself “next bull run I’ll be ready.” Spoiler: I wasn’t.

What changed was realizing that momentum and timing matter way more than blind conviction. Around Phase 15 of the Onchain Challenge (now at Phase 25) in Bitget, I started actually trading these tokens instead of hoarding them. What surprised me was how structured it became, not just random gambling. I started watching onchain liquidity flow, matching volume spikes, and using AI tools like GetAgent to analyze token movement before jumping in. The funny thing? It worked.

Even when trades didn’t hit big, the rewards system made it worth participating, and I got to learn how these smaller cap ecosystems move in real time. It’s like being paid to refine your trading discipline while still chasing that next 10x.

I’ve been keeping an eye on this current lineup for Phase 25, $KOGE, $USELESS, $PUMP, $UB, and $币安人生, and the setup looks promising with how their communities are heating up. If you’ve been reading here for a while but still stuck in the “maybe next moonshot” phase, this kind of structured challenge might be the push that gets you in rhythm.

While many small-cap cryptocurrencies have risen and fallen on waves of social-media hype, **Kendu Inu (KENDU)** continues to stand out for one key reason: it still has a **core group of long-term holders**.

The token is currently trading at roughly **$0.000010 USD** with a **market capitalization near $9.5 million**, according to CoinMarketCap. It has has weathered the slowdown that’s swept across much of the meme-coin sector this fall. Its trading volume, about **$70,000 in the past 24 hours**, is modest but stable. And while the price has slipped from its summer highs, Kendu Inu’s holder data tell a different story: wallet distribution shows a relatively concentrated yet consistent investor base that has remained active for months, across multiple chains.

# A Tale of Two Meme Markets

Compare that to the newer coins flooding Reddit and Telegram. In many of those communities, accounts that heavily promote each new project often reveal a clear pattern: posts every few months hyping a different meme coin, followed by quick silence once prices dip. Analysts say those are hallmarks of **short-term pump-and-dump activity**—a churn that makes it hard for tokens to build sustainable ecosystems. If you dig through the post histories of the loudest new meme-coin boosters, you’ll see the same names moving from one token to another. They’re trading momentum, not belief.

That behavior contrasts sharply with Kendu Inu’s subreddit and Telegram channels, where longtime participants continue discussing product launches, NFT tie-ins, and community fundraisers. ***In Kendu, you see the same screen names working the same bag for six, seven, eight months and longer. That’s unusual in this corner of crypto.***

# Community as a Stabilizer

The persistence of those holders may help explain Kendu Inu’s relative resilience. Even as liquidity tightened and speculative capital rotated out of small tokens, Kendu Inu avoided the near-total collapses seen by newer meme coins that relied solely on viral marketing. On-chain data show that the top wallets, many belonging to long-term addresses, have largely **held rather than dumped** through recent volatility.

That dynamic gives the token a reputation, at least among its supporters, for being a **builders’ meme coin**, one that prizes brand growth and incremental partnerships over flash announcements. 

# A Test of Staying Power

In a sector dominated by viral spikes and abrupt collapses, Kendu Inu’s story highlights a quieter truth about crypto investing in 2025: sometimes, **the most durable advantage isn’t hype. It’s patience**. As Reddit threads fill with the next round of meme coins promising overnight wealth, veteran Kendu holders continue to log in, watch the charts, and work the same token they’ve been supporting for months.

Whether that discipline ultimately pays off will depend on the project’s next real-world moves. For now, it’s a rare case study of **long-term conviction in a short-attention market.**

This year, I came across something pretty creative: Bitget is running an event around an AI experiment that lets you “talk” to Satoshi Nakamoto. From October 27th to November 5th, they’ve launched a special “Satoshi” version of their GetAgent tool, which not only lets users ask Satoshi-style questions but also offers free access to GetAgent Plus during the event.

Here’s the fun part by asking a Satoshi-related question, you also stand a chance to share in 0.1 BTC worth of airdrops and win a 1-month GetAgent Ultra subscription. I gave it a shot and asked what Satoshi might think of Bitcoin in 2025. The AI’s answer cautiously optimistic felt eerily accurate, acknowledging both the progress and the misuse happening today.

It’s a small, clever way to celebrate Bitcoin’s anniversary mixing nostalgia, a bit of tech novelty, and a few decent rewards for anyone curious enough to join in.

Whether your project is inactive, rebranded, or simply moving to a new chain — that locked capital doesn’t have to stay frozen forever.

At Magnum Locked Liquidity Marketplace, we help owners turn dormant liquidity into instant capital safely through OTC deals and verified escrow. Here’s why selling your locked liquidity makes sense:

💠 1. Access Instant Capital — Free up funds tied in old projects to finance your next move.

💠 2. Fair Market Valuation — We use a transparent pricing system based on liquidity depth, age, and volume.

💠 3. Secure Transactions — Every deal is done via human or on-chain escrow for full protection.

💠 4. Verified Buyer Network — 150+ active liquidity buyers across all major lockers and chains.

💠 5. Multi-Chain Support — We operate on BSC, ETH, Base, Arbitrum, TON, and more.

Your old locked liquidity isn’t worthless — it’s frozen capital waiting to be revived. Let Magnum help you unlock it.

that said, i've been looking at the depin space more carefully because some of these actually make sense, there's one that caught my attention called rumi where you earn for streaming content, sounds gimmicky at first but here's why it might actually have legs:

AI companies need massive amounts of viewing data to train recommendation models and understand content, netflix and youtube hoard this data, a decentralized alternative where users get compensated could have real b2b demand ESPECIALLY with the a16z backing which suggests they see the business model working.

But here's my skepticism; the points could just be points forever, or the token could launch and be worthless or adoption never happens we've seen this movie before with projects that had good ideas but terrible execution (Pi Network, ETN, Sweat….)

what separates potential winners from losers in this space:

- real b2b customers (not just users hoping for airdrops)
- credible backing from VCs who understand the market
- actual technical infrastructure being built
- no investment required so network effects can scale

I'm not saying ape into everything that looks like grass, most will fail, but the ones with real utility and backing might be worth being early to, even if there's no guarantee.

CryptoMoonShots,1okp392,Presales vs Airdrops: Which Paid Me More Per Hour of Research?,5amaelFlam,2025-10-31T09:31:20,2,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1okp392/presales_vs_airdrops_which_paid_me_more_per_hour/,https://reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1okp392/presales_vs_airdrops_which_paid_me_more_per_hour/,"Quick breakdown of how much money I actually made per hour from chasing a crypto presale vs farming an airdrop.

I treat this like a job. I log hours, track payouts, and ask one question: “What paid me more per hour of research?”

Here’s what I found: 👇

**1. Airdrops (a.k.a. “free money if you’re early”)**

Example: Arbitrum. When ARB launched its token, they dropped over 1 billion tokens to early users. Over 600k wallets were eligible.

Some wallets got a lot more. A handful of heavy users got 10,250 ARB each, which translated to five figures at claim time.  
For me, qualifying for a “decent” airdrop usually looks like:

* Bridging funds
* Doing swaps, staking, adding liquidity
* Using testnet stuff before it’s cool
* Coming back every few weeks so I look like a real user (not a bot)

Call it \~8–10 hours total across a few months.

**2. Crypto presales (a.k.a. “I’m basically angel investing with meme money”)**

Now let’s talk crypto presales / presale crypto coins. I’m talking launchpads, IDOs, IEOs, early rounds before first CEX listing.

Now here’s where it gets interesting for ROI per hour.

My process for a new crypto presale:

* Read litepaper / tokenomics / vesting
* Check the team (are they doxxed? shipping anything?)

That’s usually 2–3 hours max. Sometimes less if it’s on a platform I already trust as one of the best crypto presale platforms.

Let’s say I put in $500.  
Token lists 5× (which is not crazy for a halfway decent launchpad listing — 5× is actually below the 7× average reported for some 2024–2025 IEOs).

$2,000 profit off \~3 hours of work = \~$666/hour.

**3. So, which paid me more per hour of actual work?**

If I’m honest:

* Airdrops = lower risk, slower money, more manual grunt work. Feels like mining with your time.
* Crypto presales = higher risk, faster money, less total effort. Feels like startup investing.

**How I’m doing it now**

I split:

* I still farm potential airdrops on L2s / infra plays because it’s basically lottery tickets for future “free” claims.
* I also build a watchlist of upcoming crypto presales and try to filter for teams shipping something real (not just hype).

I track all this in one place because I got tired of 20 tabs. Right now I log allocations, vesting, and raise data for each crypto presale.

And yes, I do keep an eye on new drops, one that stood out was [**Digitap Presale**](https://presale.digitap.app/?utm_source=reddit%20marketing&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=marketing) **($TAP Presale)**, because having a clean feed of best crypto presale candidates and upcoming crypto presales in one place saves me stupid amounts of time on research and I honestly treat time as the main cost now, not capital.

Alright degenerates, hear me out — I’ve been grinding on a project called GOODGAME (GG). It’s basically an on-chain arcade where players can wager, earn, and trade using the GG token on Solana. Think of it like if gaming, gambling, and Web3 had a baby.

Players can play free or throw in GGW (wager credits) to win Shards and skins they can actually trade. Everything’s live and the ecosystem runs clean — no rug BS.

This thing’s got serious potential once player volume ramps — more users = more wagers = more token burn = 🚀

Not financial advice… but also maybe financial advice 😏 Alright so I’ve been building something from the ground up that could actually turn into something big — it’s called GOODGAME (GG).

It’s a full-on gaming + crypto arcade built on Solana, where people can play, wager, and earn in real time. Players use GG (the token) and its in-app currency GGW to join matches, tournaments, and even wager head-to-head. You can earn Shards for wins, unlock cosmetics, and trade them in the in-game marketplace.

Everything runs smooth, fast, and transparent — no sketchy stuff, no middlemen. You can play free with Credits or dive in with GGW wagers. There’s even PvP, club battles, and loot boxes that drop custom banners, avatars, and full themes for your profile.

I’ve been doing all the dev work myself with basically no funding, and it’s finally starting to look like something that could take off if it gets traction.

Known affectionately as Ball Ball by his family, Balltze carried a cheerful spark that turned everyday moments into small adventures. He earned a throne in memes as Cheems, a name that helped his warm, comic heart travel far beyond his Hong Kong home.

In the sunlit chapters of his life, Balltze invited everyone to smile, whether through a goofy pose, a cozy nap, or a brave moment in health challenges. 

His people wrote that he faced illness with quiet courage, touching the hearts of fans who followed his journey with care and devotion. 

Even as news came that Balltze’s journey among the living was drawing to a close, the message remained: celebrate the joy he brought, rather than dwell on goodbye.

A simple ball of sweetness, Balltze’s legacy is wrapped in the idea of a “ball” that never rolled away from kindness. His story reminds readers that a single, shining expression, a round, smiling face, can connect strangers, lift spirits, and leave a lasting imprint on the world.

Balltze’s smile returns as a beacon in a new kind of story, a memecoin that carries the name Balltze into the digital ages. 

This isn’t just currency; it’s a living tribute to a gentle heart whose joy traveled across screens and into countless hearts. 

The Balltze coin is born from the playful spirit of Cheems, but with a grounded mission: to celebrate kindness, spark laughter, and fund small acts of goodwill in communities around the world.

Why it is so important is that it is essentially a toolkit for companies to run reusable workflows that they call ""blueprints"" that prove who did what, when, and with whose approval.

So, lets think where this is applicable today. Supply chains, carbon programs, permits, audits. With this technology, every step of the way leaves a tamper-proof receipt (or audit trail) that can be checked later.

Why was this created? Well today, modern digital systems only capture transactions, not intent or approval. DOVU's blueprints capture 4 things: Intent (what was agreed), logic ( the rules), memory (what actually happened + signatures) , consequence (what changed). With this implementation, will ultimately add that trust factor in real world programs.

Where does $DOVU fit here? DOVU is the platform token. So actions on their marketplace/appstore (creating, running, royalties, logging) is priced in USD but settled with $DOVU. Tiny fees can buy/lock/burn $DOVU and pay authors/treasury.

Why am I personally bullish on it?

- DOVU is REAL utility full stop and their growing partnerships show that. They have their foot in the door in India with their vehicle recycling program, and have recently partnered with a company called VCH (Veteran Carbon Holdings) to tokenise 1.1 billion dollars worth of assets exclusively in North America. Both programs can be easily confirmed with a quick google search. DOVU was chosen for these programs because they solve a concrete problem that carbon , supply chain, and public-sector programs face.

- Usage tied economics, DOVU is hardwired for platform actions, demand is programmatic and not optional. And if the appstore is a success (to be released to the public in Q1 2026) resuable blueprints can be reused and ultimately compound value.

- They have enterprise-friendly rails. They run on Hederas network (the company behind HBAR), for low fees and fast finality. And hides the crypto complexity behind regular usd/usdc billing.

There are risks of course and blueprints executions/usage aren't guaranteed, and being a low liquidity token makes it an even riskier ""investment"" and I say investment because to me personally $DOVU is not a number go up token. Its a infrastructure. I know thats probably a 101 shill saying. But from what is confirmed as of now: the 1.1 billion dollar deal in North America, DOVU helping with the proof trail in the government backed vehicle recycling program in India, tells me that DOVU is more than just a token.

I am excited to announce the development of a new cryptocurrency my team and I are working on. The Anero Project/Anero (ANR) is a new cryptocurrency developed on the backbone of The Monero Project, and includes many significant changes and additions to the original source code. The Anero Project will be one of the few cryptonote Blockchains that included a premine of 100 Million Anero in the genesis block, with a total coin supply of 10 Billion Anero. These premine coins will be used for AirDrops, ICO's, paying developers, funding liquidity and more during Phase 1 - Temporary Centralization which is implemented to set the initial price of Anero to be pegged to 2x the price of Monero (1 Anero = 2 Monero). During Phase 1 we will release The Anero DEX on our getanero.org domain (exchange.getanero.org) where users may exchange Anero for Monero and vice-versa at the pegged price above. This is planned to be this way to ensure the price of Anero is higher than Monero, so that once Anero is listed on CEX's our Professional Market Maker's can ensure the starting price on CEX is close to the pegged price on the DEX. We have planned this because Anero will inherently be more secure than Monero due to upgrades we are currently developing that will prevent anyone from gaining 50% or more of the Anero Blockchain's Hashrate, if an out new security features detects a peer getting close to 50% (high 40%iles) it will automatically terminate their connection to the Daemon and prevent them from mining at a Hashrate higher then what we set as the Max Hashrate. To learn more about The Anero Project please visit GetAnero.org and checkout our whitepaper and roadmap. Any questions or comments are welcomed, and appreciated my name is @crystalsedge and I can be reached here or at.

Release Announcement:

I am happy to finally announce the first official release of The Anero Project under release tag v0.1.0.0-beta.1. This release includes the fully functional Anero Source Code, Anero-Wallet-Cli, Anero-Wallet-RPC and other core binary applications. The Anero Blockchain will go live on November 1st, and we will begin the development of Flourintine Vermi v0.1.0.0-beta.2 which will include many major upgrades, feature additions and bug fixes.

Now I’m trying to convert that USDC into Solana, but the app keeps blocking me because it says I don’t have enough Solana to cover the network fee. That makes zero sense to me, because I can’t buy SOL if my balance is stuck as USDC, and I can’t move the USDC without a tiny bit of SOL for gas. On top of that, the balance summary is confusing: in the token list I don’t see USDC or SOL showing as spendable, but the top of the wallet still says I have about 22 dollars in total value.

Can someone explain how to free this up in plain English? Do I need a dust amount of SOL to kick-start a swap, or is there a way to convert USDC directly without already having SOL?

Question:

What’s your take on this? Does this conversion look like a genuine opportunity, or are there red flags I might be overlooking despite the obvious upside potential?

Simon here from the Gauntlet team.

As you may know, we've been working with DFDV on **sophisticated, risk-managed onchain DeFi yield strategies** for part of their treasury to help maximize SOL Per Share (SPS).

We've seen a lot of great questions about how this all works, so we wanted to pull back the curtain. We're hosting a live webinar to go deep on the ""how"" and ""why"" of this strategy, and we’re thrilled to announce we'll be joined by **Nick Ducoff (Head of Institutional Growth at Solana)**.

He'll be in discussion with **Parker White (CIO & COO of DFDV)** and our own **Luke Sterle (Head of Derivatives Strategies at Gauntlet)**.

We'll be breaking down:

* **Nick's vision** for Solana as the platform for ""Internet Capital Markets"" and why it's the right fit for institutions.
* **Parker's mandate** for maximizing SPS and DFDV's future onchain roadmap.
* **Luke's explanation** of the market-neutral ""basis trade"" strategy DFDV is leveraging and how Gauntlet's quant approach informs risk parameters.

This is a chance to hear directly from the teams building this and get your questions answered. Add them below, and I'll do my best to ensure we cover everything.

We'll also touch on market volatility events such as what happened on Oct 10th/11th.

**Date:** Monday, November 3rd **Time:** 1:00 PM EST (10:00 AM PST)

**Register for free on the official Gauntlet website**   
(apparently I'm not allowed to link but find it on Google/our official social pages)  
**(We have added a banner on the homepage for easy registration)**

If you can't make it live, register anyway, and we'll send the recording to everyone who signs up.

Hope to see you there.

I pull or widen concentrated LPs to reduce divergence loss (LP underperformance vs holding) and avoid rebalancing during peak volatility; I wait for consolidation, then redeploy where volume and fees are persistent.

I pause auto-compounders, set TWAP or limit orders (time-weighted or price triggers) for staged entries, and redirect ongoing yield to cash so I’m taking profits without nuking positions.

If I still want exposure, I keep it delta-neutral (hedged so net price exposure ≈ zero) using perps or borrow/swap pairs until trend clarity returns.",:strategy: DeFi Strategy,True,,False

back in the early 2010s i had around 50 bitcoins. yeah, fifty. i sold them all around 300 bucks each because i thought i was a financial genius. i was walking around feeling like i’d outsmarted wall street. spoiler: i outsmarted myself.

ever since, i’ve prayed for bitcoin to crash. not dip. not correct. i mean full extinction. like, meteor-hits-the-blockchain type of crash. i wanted archaeologists to one day find a ledger and go “what the hell was this scam?”

but the universe said “nah bro, let’s make this guy watch it moon forever.” every time i wish it down, it pumps.. every time i buy something else either it be some random stock or whatever, it flatlines harder than my dating life.

so yeah bros, i’m stuck in eternal buttcoiner limbo. half of me wants bitcoin to go to zero so i can finally feel peace. the other half knows that exact thought guarantees it’ll 10x.(so I became a bitcoiner by buying 0.005 (1/1000th bitcoin of what I had then because that is how broke I am))

i am both the bagholder and the hater. the universe’s favorite exit liquidity.

  
if bitcoin ever dies, i’ll finally be happy!
