    "selftext": "Ok so boom I‚Äôm a truck driver I zoned out and I was thinking real hard and I hope it wasn‚Äôt for nothing.\n\nYou get 2 accounts right. 2 leveraged accounts with the same size. So for example let‚Äôs just say 1000 on each. We are bullish on bitcoin long term. Only way this fails if bitcoin drops 90-100% and I will explain and I hope I don‚Äôt sound dumb üò≠\n\nOn one account you are only buying and on 1 account you are only selling. To calculate your risk you will divide your balance so 1,000 and divide it by whichever one your feeling 80,90 or 100% let‚Äôs just stick to if bitcoin dumps 90%. So 1000/90 =11.111 ok and you will sell half of that on the other account. So let‚Äôs do 12 and 6. You will buy bitcoin and if it pumps 1% you make $24 but you will lose $12 on the other account since you sold $6 with a 1% stop loss. That‚Äôs a net profit of $12 every time bitcoin pumps 1% from your entry. This is where things get interesting. \n\nWhen price dumps 1% you DO NOT close your buy position, but every time price drops 1% you will take 50% of the profit. For example, if price dumps 10% you‚Äôre up $60 on the short but your down $120 on the long side. Remember you are taking 50% each 1% drop so you took out around $27. If price pumps back up 11% you will make $24 from your long that you did not close out. You will lose $12 from the short position and you will be in profit yet again. Obviously with more leverage you could make more and don‚Äôt forget about fees. But do I sound dumb? This makes sense",

Should Hyperliquid, Aster and other DEXs show ADL like CEX do?  \n  \nAs someone who was affected by the Oct 10 liquidations, it got me digging into DEX mechanics and ADL.  \nPerp trading isn‚Äôt you vs the market.  \nIt‚Äôs you vs the liquidation engine, core mechanics most miss:  \n\\- Perps = synthetic contracts. Zero sum. No BTC ownership. Every $1 profit = $1 loss elsewhere.  \n\\- Funding rates keep perps pegged to spot. Longs pay shorts (or vice versa) to balance OI.  \n\\- Heavy perp buying ‚Üí funding spikes ‚Üí arb bots buy spot ‚Üí BTC price indirectly lifts. No arb? Drift city.\n\nWhen liquidations gap past bankruptcy price ‚Üí insolvency.  \nWho eats it?   \nCEXs (Binance): Insurance fund and only then deleveraging.\n\nDEXs: LP vaults (GMX, Hyperliquid, Drift) ‚Üí pool bleeds; Order-book (dYdX) ‚Üí insurance ‚Üí ADL.\n\nADL is the last resort.  \nFormula: (PnL / Notional) √ó (Notional / Equity)  \nTranslation: Most profitable + most leveraged = first to get force-closed.  \nYou keep PnL. You lose exposure. Market moons? You watch from the sidelines.   \nOct 10 cascade:vBillions wiped. Cought in sharpnel were Delta-neutral farmers who were running long/short pairs for points.  Their short leg most likely got ADL‚Äôd, producing losses on the long.  I talk more about it in this vid: [https://youtu.be/aEGfypBQ8Pc](https://youtu.be/aEGfypBQ8Pc) Hedge was gone. ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù money became dumb.   \n  \nTransparency scoreboard:\n\n|Platform|Shows ADL Queue?|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aevo|Yes|\n|Hyperliquid|No|\n|GMX / Drift|No (LP eats)|\n|dYdX|Partial stats|\n|Binance|Warning UI|\n\nThe questions are:\n\nShould DEXs be required to publish live ADL rankings like funding rates & OI?  \nOr is secrecy part of the ‚Äúgame theory‚Äù edge?  \nOnly users can dictate that, and I doubt enough ppl care.   \n  \nYes camp:  \nPrevents blind bombs; Builds trust; Stops ‚Äúsmart‚Äù farmers from getting rekt by hidden mechanics.; Transparency = maturity benchmark.\n\nNo camp:  \nQueue-jumping becomes meta; Sharp traders exploit opacity; Forces better risk models.",

A lot of what looks like ‚ÄúTrump loves crypto‚Äù lines up almost perfectly with stuff that benefits him... his family... or people close to him... not the average person holding BTC on a phone.\n\nFirst... the public moves. He has been saying the U S should ‚Äúsupport‚Äù digital assets... he has framed it as ending the old ‚Äúwar on crypto‚Äù... and he has tried to make it sound like America is open for on chain business again. All very loud... very pro innovation.\n\nAt the same time... reports this year said the Trump family‚Äôs own crypto and token ventures have pulled in hundreds of millions of dollars... in the same window when the administration was sounding the most crypto friendly. That overlap is hard to ignore. It looks less like ‚Äúpro crypto‚Äù and more like ‚Äúwe made it friendlier while we were selling.‚Äù\n\nThen there was the CZ pardon. Call it mercy if you want... but it was clearly a made-for-one-person decision. In the months leading up to it... Binance and CZ brought on Trump-aligned lobbyists... hired a D.C. firm close to his circle and spent serious money... and looped in a former SEC-adjacent lawyer who already had credibility with the new team. Several reports said the clemency push went through political channels... not the usual DOJ path. So this wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe administration helped crypto‚Äù... it was ‚Äúa well connected crypto billionaire bought his way to the front of the line.‚Äù\n\nNow add the tariff noise. Every time he rattles trade partners... Canada... Europe... whoever... it makes legacy markets nervous and pushes some attention back toward crypto... while his circle is the group most ready to sell... raise... and market in that environment. Convenient timing.\n\nSo yeah... he is not ‚Äúpro crypto‚Äù the way CT means it. He is pro... his... crypto. Pro... his donors‚Äô... crypto. Pro... his friends‚Äô... crypto. Everyone else still has to buy tops and read press releases.",

He went public, started posting receipts, and the story blew up. The pressure must‚Äôve worked, because as of today, he confirmed the funds are back in his wallet.\n\nIt‚Äôs a big win for him, but let‚Äôs be real: it never should‚Äôve gotten to this point. The only reason this got resolved is because the guy had a huge following and made enough noise to embarrass MEXC into doing the right thing.\n\nMost regular users wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance in a situation like this.\n\nSo yeah, it‚Äôs great that the White Whale finally got paid, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that MEXC froze a legit trader‚Äôs funds for months and only fixed it once the internet got involved. That‚Äôs not a trustworthy platform, that‚Äôs damage control.\n\nIf you‚Äôre still trading there, take this as your sign to get out now. Move your funds to a better alternative like Hyperliquid, a decentralized exchange where you actually hold your own keys and don‚Äôt have to deal with shady centralized nonsense.\n\nTX: 3P6uFgiRE6veZpAHidzLHqqx8cEAW6hxR8ZZzZqTmjC2jHBzhMqK1CcGkirSX77wgnKRqywCHraNfvuKHDxeqz4f\n\nTL;DR:\nMEXC froze a trader‚Äôs $3.15M for months.\nThe guy went public ‚Üí got massive attention ‚Üí MEXC finally paid him.\nDon‚Äôt take this as proof they‚Äôre ‚Äúgood‚Äù again.\nCEXs gonna CEX, use Hyperliquid instead and protect yourself. \n\nNot financial advice, just common sense.",

I'm far from an expert, but I see the experts saying things like we could crash 60 to 90% instantly, if stock market bubble pops. I don't really see a case for that when the majority of people are supposedly holding for decades to come. It actually makes more sense to me that money would jump from the stock market to BTC if a downturn on that side happens, but all the experts say the opposite. Risk assets drop faster when the stock market goes down.  On the flip side I don't see the bullish case either.  I don't see new interest.  We had all these ETFs flow in this year, yet the price is stagnant. Where is the $$ supposed to be coming from that we can go up to 150k or higher in the next few months?  Neither side makes sense to me.   What I could see happening is just a sad gradual drop back to basically nothing over the course of a couple years.  I need somebody who isn't an absolute Saylor disciple to talk me down off the ledge LOL",

Every cycle, people fade Solana, and every cycle, something wild comes out of it, from NFTs to the current memecoin wave.\n\nI‚Äôve been following some of the smaller tokens that popped up during this season like $USELESS and $PUMP. Most of them started as memes, but what surprised me was how some traders are actually using these to build consistent wins rather than chasing overnight moonshots. That mindset shift hit me hard... I used to hold bags for months waiting for miracles, now I focus more on execution and rotations.\n\nRecently I‚Äôve been joining these Onchain challenges where trading activity itself gets rewarded. I use Bitget for it since their system tracks performance across curated tokens (they even have their own Onchain events for $KOGE, $UB, and others). What I like is that they integrate tools like GetAgent to study token behavior before jumping in. It made me more methodical and less emotional about entries.\n\nSolana keeps giving room for traders who can adapt fast. Whether it‚Äôs memes or real utility, this chain still rewards those who keep their eyes open and play momentum smartly.",

    "selftext": "Prediction markets on Solana are redefining how users interact with forecasting and betting. Leveraging Solana‚Äôs high-throughput, low-cost blockchain infrastructure, these decentralized applications deliver efficient and seamless peer-to-peer prediction experiences. From sports betting and event outcome predictions to market forecasting, Solana‚Äôs ecosystem provides transparent, secure, and reliable platforms that enable decentralized wagering with minimal fees and near-instant settlements.\n\n  \nEach event is defined by opposing outcomes, represented as YES and NO shares. Traders can take a position on either side based on what they believe will happen. The price of each share ranges between $0 and $1, with the two always summing to $1, symbolizing the market‚Äôs perception of probability. In other words, the price itself reveals how confident participants are in a particular outcome.\n\nWhen the event concludes, the winning side settles at $1 per share, while the losing side drops to zero. Traders who backed the correct outcome earn returns proportional to their stake, after the platform‚Äôs small fee.\n\nFor example, imagine a trader purchases $100 worth of YES shares priced at $0.30 (about 333.3 shares). If the event happens, those shares settle at $1, returning $333.30 and yielding a $233.30 profit. If it doesn‚Äôt, the YES shares expire worthless, and the trader loses their initial investment.\n\n  \n**Understanding the Order Book**  \nPolymarket runs on a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB), built for binary markets. Each event has one unified ledger showing all buy and sell orders, keeping liquidity transparent. Orders are limit-based, giving traders full price control. A hybrid system powers it‚Äîoff-chain services handle order matching for speed, while an on-chain contract finalizes trades and manages collateral securely.\n\n**Order Mirroring**  \nEvery order on Polymarket is mirrored as its opposite to keep prices balanced. Since ‚ÄúYES‚Äù and ‚ÄúNO‚Äù shares must always total $1, buying a ‚ÄúYES‚Äù at $0.40 automatically implies a ‚ÄúNO‚Äù at $0.60. This prevents price drift, maintains liquidity, and stops arbitrage‚Äîensuring both sides of a binary event stay efficient.\n\n**Price Formation and Probabilities**  \nPrices come from trader activity, turning market actions into real-time probabilities. When ‚ÄúYES‚Äù and ‚ÄúNO‚Äù orders match, a trade sets the initial price, like $0.70 YES and $0.30 NO (a 70% implied probability). Polymarket then updates this using the **Midpoint Method** for tight spreads or the **Last Trade Method** when liquidity is low.\n\n  \nTo know more about how prediction market traders are making bags and understand the technical architecture better, check out: \n\n[https://x.com/Astralaneio/status/1984361363855327529](https://x.com/Astralaneio/status/1984361363855327529)  \n[https://medium.com/@astralaneio/the-solana-shift-prediction-markets-enter-the-fast-lane-2f780b9c11e9](https://medium.com/@astralaneio/the-solana-shift-prediction-markets-enter-the-fast-lane-2f780b9c11e9)  \n[https://deepwiki.com/PolyTrader/polymarket-trading](https://deepwiki.com/PolyTrader/polymarket-trading)  \n[https://rocknblock.io/blog/how-polymarket-works-the-tech-behind-prediction-markets](https://rocknblock.io/blog/how-polymarket-works-the-tech-behind-prediction-markets)",

    "selftext": "Just read Bitwise‚Äôs latest take on Solana and thought you guys should hear this. They basically say investing in SOL right now is making two bets at once.\n\nFirst bet is that stablecoins and tokenized assets are going to get way bigger in the next few years. Second bet is that Solana grabs a bigger slice of that growth.\n\nRight now the stablecoin market is a little over 300 billion dollars and onchain tokenized assets are in the tens of billions... together call it a bit above 330 billion dollars today. Ethereum still dominates that activity. Solana‚Äôs stablecoin supply is around 15 billion dollars and rising fast... so it is meaningful but not 14 percent of a 768 billion dollar market like some older numbers said. That was the part that needed fixing.\n\nWhat makes Solana stand out... according to Bitwise... is speed plus an ecosystem that institutions are actually starting to touch. Western Union literally just announced a dollar stablecoin (USDPT) that will launch on Solana in 2026... which is a pretty strong signal that big regulated money is willing to ship on SOL.\n\nMatt Hougan... their CIO... basically says we are still early in stablecoins and tokenized assets becoming normal finance. If that whole market grows... and Solana keeps winning deployments like Western Union... SOL gets to win twice... from market growth and from market share.\n\nObviously not financial advice... but it is interesting to see a big asset manager stay this bullish on Solana this late in the cycle.",

    "selftext": "Bitcoin on Friday was on track for a monthly loss in October for the first time since 2018, snapping a seven-year streak of gains that had earned the month a lucky reputation among cryptocurrency traders.\n\nBitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, is set for a nearly 5% decline this month, as the digital asset has struggled in recent weeks amid broader market jitters and muted investor risk appetite.\n\nCryptocurrencies \"came into October, tracking gold, tracking stocks near all-time highs, and then as uncertainty hit people for the first time maybe this year, they didn't rotate back into bitcoin en masse,\" said Adam McCarthy, a senior research analyst at digital market data provider Kaiko.\n\nOctober saw the largest crypto liquidation in history after U.S. President¬†[Donald Trump](https://www.moneycontrol.com/topic/donald-trump/)¬†announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports and threatened export controls on critical software.\n\nBitcoin fell as low as $104,782.88 during the October 10-11 period, after setting a fresh record high just days earlier above $126,000.\n\n\"That washout on the 10th, it really reminded people that this asset class is very narrow,\" said McCarthy. \"It's bitcoin and (ether), and even those can still have 10% drawdowns in 15, 20 minutes.\"\n\nA whirlwind October is set to end with spooked investors unsure of the global monetary policy¬†path in the near term, as the U.S. Federal Reserve pushed back against market bets that it would continue to cut rates this year as the government shutdown blocks crucial economic data.\n\nMeanwhile, several influential figures have expressed concerns about high valuations in equity markets. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this month warned of a heightened risk of a significant correction in the U.S. stock market within the next six months to two years.\n\nDespite its October decline, bitcoin is still up more than 16% so far this year.\n\nCryptocurrencies have generally enjoyed a boost this year as Trump has embraced digital assets, which has led to the dismissal of a spate of lawsuits against prominent crypto platforms and a shift by Trump's financial regulators to create specialized rules to accommodate digital assets.",

    "selftext": "I know u people have probably heard it before but it is way clearer now than it was a year ago. A lot of what looks like ‚ÄúTrump loves crypto‚Äù lines up almost perfectly with stuff that benefits him... his family... or people close to him... not the average person holding BTC on a phone.\n\nFirst... the public moves. He has been saying the U S should ‚Äúsupport‚Äù digital assets... he has framed it as ending the old ‚Äúwar on crypto‚Äù... and he has tried to make it sound like America is open for on chain business again. All very loud... very pro innovation.\n\nAt the same time... reports this year said the Trump family‚Äôs own crypto and token ventures have pulled in hundreds of millions of dollars... in the same window when the administration was sounding the most crypto friendly. That overlap is hard to ignore. It looks less like ‚Äúpro crypto‚Äù and more like ‚Äúwe made it friendlier while we were selling.‚Äù\n\nThen there was the CZ pardon. Call it mercy if you want... but it was clearly a made-for-one-person decision. In the months leading up to it... Binance and CZ brought on Trump-aligned lobbyists... hired a D.C. firm close to his circle and spent serious money... and looped in a former SEC-adjacent lawyer who already had credibility with the new team. Several reports said the clemency push went through political channels... not the usual DOJ path. So this wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe administration helped crypto‚Äù... it was ‚Äúa well connected crypto billionaire bought his way to the front of the line.‚Äù\n\nNow add the tariff noise. Every time he rattles trade partners... Canada... Europe... whoever... it makes legacy markets nervous and pushes some attention back toward crypto... while his circle is the group most ready to sell... raise... and market in that environment. Convenient timing.\n\nSo yeah... he is not ‚Äúpro crypto‚Äù the way CT means it. He is pro... his... crypto. Pro... his donors‚Äô... crypto. Pro... his friends‚Äô... crypto. Everyone else still has to buy tops and read press releases.",

(I actually bought a car with BTC gains). \n\nAs the crypto space matures, and as my gains continue to rise, I've done...well, nothing. I haven't trimmed my portfolio, invested in new projects, balanced my portfolio. The last thing I did was trim BTC when it hit $100k (the first time) and bought more XRP. \n\nLong story short, I feel as though I'm wandering aimlessly in crypto without a theme, or structure, for what I'm doing. Now, on one hand, I've done very, very well for gains. On the other hand, I don't want to \"trade\" in this market because the gains are prohibitively expensive in my current tax structure with a high income. So my crypto just sits. And sits. I'm not getting impatient, per se, but I cant help but wonder if I should be more focused on a strategy of some sort. \n\nIs anyone else in the same boat? Can anyone provide insight into a strategy they use? Or is it just HODL until I can buy my own island?",

    "selftext": "Been trying out this Solana project called Lottery Token (LOTTO) and it‚Äôs honestly one of the coolest mechanics I‚Äôve seen. It‚Äôs a real on-chain lottery with no fake RNG or off-chain promises. The actual lottery logic is in the smart contract, and you can verify every jackpot and burn right on Solana Explorer.\n\nThe basics are simple: fixed 500 million LOTTO supply, you hold 10k LOTTO to play, and every spin burns 250 tokens forever. There‚Äôs a 1 percent chance to hit a 25,000 LOTTO jackpot, but here‚Äôs the crazy part, every jackpot destroys way more tokens than it pays out. So over time, the supply just keeps shrinking, making it hyper deflationary by design.\n\nIt‚Äôs fully transparent too. Mint authority revoked, freeze authority revoked, everything enforced on-chain. The UI is slick, looks like a neon slot machine, and connects right to Phantom. Every spin updates your balance in real time, so it actually feels fun to use instead of just clicking a random generator.\n\nYou can track the live burn stats and dApp link on X at @LOTTOtokenx. The community‚Äôs been posting their wins and losses under #LOTTOQuantum and it‚Äôs been fun to watch it grow.",

    "selftext": "Low volume, low liquidity and will move FAST! There is less than $60k of tokens available out there at these prices.  There is a PUMP planned so get in hang on and take some profits on the way up.\n\n\n\nHere‚Äôs a summary of what I found on PayNet Protocol (ticker PAYNET), a token on the Solana blockchain ‚Äî along with major caveats and warning signs. This is not investment advice; treat this as a research-overview.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n‚úÖ What the project claims\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†According to its website, PayNet Protocol describes itself as ‚Äúan open HTTP payment protocol enabling instant, programmatic payments for APIs and AI agents.‚Äù  Ôøº\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The token is on Solana: the token mint address is shown on Solana explorers as 9TwMHjLVck28reN4eHFxeqMYKkJBxLqwX8w7rxrdpump.  Ôøº\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†On DEX listing data: one listing shows ‚ÄúPayNet is building payments for the AI ecosystem ‚Äî Solana / multi-network x402 facilitator.‚Äù  Ôøº\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Token metrics:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Total/ circulating supply ~ 998.2 million (or ~1 billion) tokens.  Ôøº\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Market cap & liquidity are extremely low in some listings: e.g., one DEX data shows FDV ~$26k, liquidity ~$21k.  Ôøº\n\n‚∏ª\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Warning signs & major risks\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The liquidity is very low. One example: liquidity ~US$21,000 for the pool.  Ôøº\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The pool (for PAYNET/SOL) appears very new (just 2 days old in that listing) which may signal a high-risk launch.  Ôøº\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The project is very early stage and appears to have minimal verified usage or adoption. The claims are ambitious but lack detailed evidence publicly.\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Because of the low liquidity and newness, it is very vulnerable to price manipulation, pump-and-dump schemes, or rug pulls.\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The website and listings caution that this token is ‚Äúunverified‚Äù in some wallets (e.g., the Phantom wallet page shows ‚ÄúThis token is unverified. Only interact with tokens you trust.‚Äù)  Ôøº\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Given the combination of ambitious claims + very low market cap + new listing + low liquidity = extremely high risk.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüìä Current status / data snapshot\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†On CoinGecko the price is shown around US$0.00003485 (as of the data capture) with circulating supply ~998 million.  Ôøº\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The DEX pool shows a price of ~$0.00002648 with volume ~US$500k in 24h, liquidity ~$21k.  Ôøº\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The token appears to trade primarily on decentralized Solana DEXs (e.g., a ‚ÄúPumpSwap‚Äù listing) rather than major centralized exchanges.  Ôøº\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Market cap is tiny (on some data under US$30-40k). For example one site shows market cap ~$25k.  Ôøº\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüîç My assessment\n\nBased on available information, this project exhibits many traits of a very high-risk, early-stage token. Some key takeaways:\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†If you‚Äôre considering this, you should assume high probability of loss or that this might be speculative/hype rather than a matured project.\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Because the liquidity is so low, getting in or out might be difficult and you could face large slippage.\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†The ambitious use-case (payments across AI agents, multi-network) is interesting, but I found very little publicly verifiable track record of adoption or partnerships.\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Always check:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Who is behind the project (team, advisors)?\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Are there audited smart contracts?\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Are tokenomics clear (lock-ups, vesting, allocations)?\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†What is the listing/exchange strategy?\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†What is the community commentary (forums, reddit, etc.)?\n¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†¬†¬†Given the newness and risk profile, if you engage it, only do so as a small speculative allocation, and only funds you can afford to lose.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nIf you like, I can pull recent on-chain analytics (holders, large wallets, transaction history) for PAYNET and check for red-flags (e.g., concentrated ownership, large token allocations to team/unlocked wallets). Would you like me to do that?",

After I spent few days trying to speak to their \"support team \" it was obvious that they do not want to help. Either because they regularly steal BTC deposits, or the steal was made by someone in there. 30 % of my BTC deposits were stolen and I was talked to as some kind of idiot who must accept this.\n\nThere is actually stories on CNBC about their owner Kris Marsazalek - involved in dodgy stuff prior [crypto.com](http://crypto.com)\n\n\n\n[Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) is scam stealing deposits. I don't how this company is allowed to have a licence ? Who is he protected from ? Crypto businesses around the world have to comply with stringent regulations but one company can steal deposits, and then over their support chat , have their customers lied to that all that is normal. Well Kris and your criminal crew God watches. You will get what you deserve.\n\n\n\nThis is my support request which was ignored by their \"support\"\n\n\n\nHello, there is 0.00086032 BTC missing from my account. \n\nMy previous chat was also about the same issue. You asked me to provide the details of the 4 BTC deposit transactions that need to be reviewed. Here in provide again a summary of the issue as well as the transaction information which you requested. Please create a suport ticket about this.\n\nThe other day I made 4 BTC Deposits:\n\n0.00094798 0.000590340.000881 0.00197 \n\nTotal Deposits:0.00438932 BTC\n\nI was allowed to sell only: 0.003529 BTC\n\nThis amount of BTC is missing from my account:0.00086032\n\nI was only allowed to sell 0.00086032 when my total deposits were 0.00438932 .\n\nI am asking you to confirm this and debit my account with missing amount of :0.00086032\n\nIn my previous chat about this same issues you asked me to provide the details of the 4 BTC transactions in my account. I have included the information below. It is a brand new account with no other BTC transactions, so it is easy to check them. There is one last 5th sale BTC to EUR transaction which shows that the system only allowed me to sell 0.003529 instead of the total amount deposited.\n\n",

    "selftext": "The concept of a Digital Asset Treasury has become one of the strongest narratives in crypto. Public companies and onchain entities are building treasuries that hold tokens as strategic assets. So far, these treasuries have centered around Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Litecoin. They represent stability and liquidity, but their large market caps limit growth potential.\n\nBONK is positioned differently. With a market capitalization of about 1.15 billion dollars, it is a mid-cap token with an expanding ecosystem and a growing digital asset treasury. This structure provides a high-upside version of the treasury model that larger assets cannot replicate.\n\nBonk Inc. (BNKK) serves as the BONK Digital Asset Treasury. It currently holds about 2.75 percent of BONK‚Äôs circulating supply and is targeting 5 percent by year end. The company receives a 10 percent revenue share from the¬†[BONK.fun](http://bonk.fun/)¬†platform and reinvests about 90 percent of that income into BONK accumulation. This creates continuous, external buying pressure linked directly to product activity.\n\nIn practical terms, BONK combines the reflexivity of a community token with a formal, revenue-backed treasury structure. Each percentage increase in holdings by BNKK represents tens of millions of dollars in direct demand. For a token of BONK‚Äôs size, that demand has a measurable effect.\n\nBeyond the treasury, BONK maintains one of the most developed ecosystems among meme coins. It has more than 400 integrations and operates on 13 chains. Its ecosystem includes¬†[BONK.fun](http://bonk.fun/)¬†for token launches, BONK Bot for trading, BONK Swap for liquidity, and an NFT marketplace. It also has partnerships with European soccer football clubs and a fitness application that introduces utility beyond trading.\n\nBONK is close to reaching one million onchain holders on Solana. When that milestone is reached, the community plans to burn 1% of total supply. The network effects from this scale, combined with deflationary activity, strengthen the case for BONK‚Äôs long-term positioning.\n\nThe reason BONK stands out among DATs is that its market cap allows for meaningful acceleration. Large-cap treasuries require substantial inflows to move the market. BONK‚Äôs smaller size makes each unit of demand more impactful while maintaining enough liquidity for institutional entry through Solana and multi-chain access.\n\nMost existing DATs function as passive holders. BONK‚Äôs model introduces an active loop where ecosystem revenue drives continuous accumulation. This approach integrates product success directly with treasury growth, aligning holders, builders, and the public-market entity under one framework.\n\nAt its current stage, BONK is the only token combining broad ecosystem utility, measurable buyback mechanisms, and a growing corporate treasury that is publicly listed and verifiable. It operates at a scale where treasury growth can still produce meaningful price impact while having the infrastructure and integration depth of a mature ecosystem.\n\nIn the context of digital asset treasuries, BONK represents a smaller, faster, and more integrated model that links real revenue with token accumulation. Among existing DATs, it has the most capacity for upside.",

    "selftext": "Every bull run, new altcoins pop up promising the next big thing, but only a few actually have the fundamentals to survive once the hype fades. Over time, i have learned that spotting solid projects early is not about luck, it is about looking past the noise and digging into what really matters.\n\nThe first thing i check is the problem the project is solving. If it‚Äôs tackling a real issue in crypto, scalability, interoperability, or even how data is handled, that‚Äôs a good sign. Hype driven tokens often focus on marketing first, utility later. The stronger ones start with a clear use case and build from there.\n\nAnother key sign is how active the dev team and community are. Real projects have consistent updates, engaged communities, and transparent development. For example, i recently came across TauNet and its token $AGRS, a project working on logic based smart contracts for decentralized knowledge exchange. If you are into digging deeper into early stage tech, their Telegram channel @ TauNet is worth a look.\n\nLastly, don‚Äôt underestimate tokenomics and long term vision. A project can have great ideas, but if its supply model or reward system is flawed, it won‚Äôt last. I always ask myself, is this sustainable, or just designed to pump short term?\n\nIn the end, finding strong altcoins before the crowd does takes patience and curiosity. Ignore the FOMO, follow the fundamentals, and you will start noticing that the real opportunities often hide behind the quiet, underrated projects building real value.\n\n¬†[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/agoras-tokens/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/agoras-tokens/)",

    "selftext": "The evolution of blockchain technology isn‚Äôt merely about achieving faster transactions. The deeper goal lies in reactive synthesis, creating networks that can automatically adapt and evolve based on the formal specifications of their participants. This vision moves beyond static protocols toward systems capable of redefining themselves in real time to meet collective requirements.\n\nTau Net explores this idea as a next-generation blockchain concept designed to generate its own protocol from the shared logic of its users. Instead of relying on a fixed governance structure, Tau Net introduces a model where collective reasoning can directly shape how the network operates.\n\nTraditional crypto governance faces significant limitations. DAO voting systems suffer from low participation, slow proposal cycles, and decision-making dominated by small groups. These issues mirror insights from Arrow‚Äôs Impossibility Theorem, which mathematically proves that no voting system can perfectly represent everyone‚Äôs preferences at scale.\n\nTau Net‚Äôs approach suggests a potential path forward, integrating AI-driven governance to enable large scale, dynamic collaboration. Rather than depending on rigid voting, the system could synthesize collective input into coherent, evolving protocols. The future of blockchain may rest on fostering true collective intelligence rather than mere transactional efficiency.\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/agoras-tokens/",

This is called a 'multiplier effect' (Macroeconomics 101)  \n  \n\\----------------------------------  \n  \nNow here is what's happening with xUSD (Stream Finance) and deUSD (Elixir)  \n  \nBank A (xUSD) - Stream  \n  \nBank B (deUSD) - Elixir  \n  \nYou deposit $100 in Stream (Bank A) and get 100xUSD (Banks don't give you tokenised deposits so this is a core value prop of DeFi )  \n  \nStream keeps 0% in reserve ($0) and takes that $100 to Elixir (Bank B)  \n  \nStream deposit $100 in Elixir (Bank B) and get 100 deUSD    \n  \nNow comes a 'Bank C'  \n  \nThat 100 deUSD goes to some Bank C as deposit and Bank C loans out $90 cash back to Stream (Bank A)  \n  \nStream repeats above loop again with $90 cash  \n  \nBased on on-chain proofs, the Stream is currently able to mint about 760 xUSD with just $100 deposit  \n  \nNow comes a Bank D  \n  \nThis Bank D accepts xUSD as deposits   \n  \nSo, Stream deposits 760 xUSD and gets 90% of it bank as loan in $684  \n  \nStream then redeposit this $684 back to mint more xUSD and then again the loop starts  \n  \n\\----------------------------------  \n  \nBut recursive borrowing should cost interest.  \n  \nSo, how does this work?  \n  \nIt's because Borrow costs remain below farming yields and token fascination.   \n  \nEvery recursive looping strategy boils down to token farming at the end.   \n  \nWe are all just chasing tokens.   \n  \nNow here's a thing  \n  \nThese are not stablecoins. These are yield coins and now being agreed by these project founders also.   \n  \nSo, yield coins peg if deviates from $1 then the recursive looping threatens  \n  \nUnless you are big banks like 'AAVE' and 'Ethena' where you hardcode the peg as $1 and call it a best security practice.   \n  \nUltimately, every one of these high APY business model works because of token farming.   \n  \nIt offers far higher multiplier than TradFi so in a way allows better use of money.   \n  \nBut, this 'ponzi' in crypto comes from  \n  \nmoney being used to create more synthetic money   \n  \nwith the high yields indirectly coming out of 'token' farming.   \n  \nand the value of most tokens depends entirely on future buyers paying more than current buyers  \n  \nAs long as this belief holds  \n  \nEvery bit of this synthetic money will be converted to USDC/USDT which will then flow into the economy and increase the GDP of the real economy   \n  \nAlthough most will flow back into crypto to farm some other synthetic money as who wants to pay such high taxes\n\nI'm now focusing on projects that generate yields through their own internal mechanisms, rather than looping across multiple DeFi protocols. Even if they‚Äôre new or have low TVL, that‚Äôs perfectly fine.\n\nI'm currently trying Gammaswap, Autonomint and Rysk Finance as I want to earn yield without facing any token price dump. ",

    "selftext": "We‚Äôre exploring a simple idea: every trade feeds a shared USDT reserve that exists only to deepen liquidity. There are no buttons to withdraw that reserve to a wallet; it can be used solely to support/add liquidity. When we add liquidity, the LP tokens are burned, so that liquidity can‚Äôt be pulled later. The token itself is plain‚Äîno upgrade levers, no blacklists, no pause switch. A small burn on trades nudges supply down over time.\n\nThere is one safety valve for extremes: if circulating supply ever becomes dangerously thin, a limited ‚Äúrefloat‚Äù could happen‚Äîbut only within strict, pre-announced limits and only if it‚Äôs backed by the existing USDT reserve and current market price. Founders‚Äô allocation is locked long-term with slow, rule-based releases.\n\nQuestions for the crowd:\n\n1. Does this strike the right balance between credibility (no admin keys) and resilience (a rule-bound refloat), or would you drop the valve entirely?\n2. Is ‚Äúreserves can only flow into liquidity‚Äù clear and trustable in practice, or would you still expect an additional timelock/multisig layer even without withdrawal paths?\n3. What day-one transparency would you want (events, dashboards, proofs) to independently follow reserves and liquidity?\n4. Any hidden pitfalls we‚Äôre missing‚Äîespecially if supply/reserve accounting spans multiple chains?\n\nThanks for any blunt feedback.",

    "selftext": "In about 3 more months if BTC stays in the range it has this entire year, SPY will likely outperform it on the 5 year chart without even counting DRIP. Will crypto bros then pretend the 5 year doesn‚Äôt matter and point us yet again to the all time chart?. Interesting coping ahead.",

The greater the price of Bitcoin, the more likely it is that Tether will be exposed, is my understanding correct?\n\nWe all know bitcoin pumps when tether prints.",
